      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this algebra problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: If n is such that 36 \u2264 n \u2264 72, then x equals (n squared plus 2 times the square root of n times (n plus 4) plus 16) divided by (n plus 4 times the square root of n plus 4). We need to find which interval x falls into. The options are A to E, with E being none of these.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's write down the expression for x to get a clearer picture.\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16] / [n + 4\u221an + 4]\n\nWait, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify it. Let me think about whether the numerator and denominator can be factored or rewritten in a way that makes it easier.\n\nLooking at the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) + 16. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in terms of \u221an. Let me see. Let me denote \u221an as t, so t = \u221an. Then n = t\u00b2. Let's substitute that into the numerator.\n\nSo, numerator becomes t^4 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) + 16. Let me expand that:\n\nt^4 + 2t*(t\u00b2) + 2t*(4) +16\n= t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem to factor easily. Maybe I made a mistake in substitution. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the original numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let me expand that 2\u221an(n+4) term.\n\n2\u221an * n = 2n^(3/2)\n2\u221an * 4 = 8\u221an\nSo the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's not the easiest way. Maybe the denominator can be rewritten as well. The denominator is n +4\u221an +4. Let me see if that's a perfect square or something.\n\nWait, n is t\u00b2, so denominator becomes t\u00b2 +4t +4. Oh, that's (t+2)^2. Because (t+2)^2 = t\u00b2 +4t +4. Oh, that's a good catch! So the denominator is (t+2)^2, where t is \u221an.\n\nNow, what about the numerator? Let's express it in terms of t again.\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16 = (t^2)^2 + 2t*(t^2 +4) +16.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\nt^4 + 2t*(t^2) + 2t*(4) +16\n= t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nHmm, I'm trying to see if this can be factored. Let me think. Maybe group terms?\n\nt^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nLet me group the first two terms and the last two:\n\n(t^4 + 2t^3) + (8t +16)\n= t^3(t + 2) + 8(t + 2)\n= (t^3 +8)(t + 2)\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, t^4 + 2t^3 = t^3(t + 2)\nAnd 8t +16 = 8(t + 2)\nSo factoring (t + 2) gives:\n\n(t + 2)(t^3 +8)\n\nAh, yes! Because t^3 +8 is a sum of cubes. Remember, a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2).\n\nSo, t^3 +8 = (t + 2)(t^2 - 2t +4). So putting it all together:\n\nNumerator = (t + 2)(t^3 +8) = (t +2)(t +2)(t^2 -2t +4) = (t +2)^2 (t^2 -2t +4).\n\nWait, no, wait. Because (t +2)(t^3 +8) = (t +2)(t +2)(t^2 - 2t +4) since t^3 +8 factors as (t+2)(t^2 -2t +4). So the numerator is (t+2)^2 (t^2 -2t +4).\n\nSo, numerator is (t+2)^2 (t^2 -2t +4), and denominator is (t+2)^2. So when we take the ratio, the (t+2)^2 terms cancel out.\n\nSo x = [ (t+2)^2 (t^2 - 2t +4) ] / (t+2)^2 ) = t^2 -2t +4.\n\nBut since t is \u221an, t^2 is n. So x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, that's a much simpler expression! So x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nNow, the problem states that n is between 36 and 72, inclusive. So n can be as low as 36 and as high as 72.\n\nWe need to find the range of x in this interval.\n\nSo x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nLet me think about how x behaves as n changes from 36 to 72.\n\nLet me compute x at n=36 and n=72.\n\nFirst, at n=36:\n\n\u221a36 =6.\n\nSo x=36 -2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nAt n=72:\n\n\u221a72 is approximately 8.485 (since 8^2=64, 9^2=81, so 8.485^2 \u224872).\n\nSo x=72 -2*8.485 +4 = 72 -16.97 +4 = 72+4=76; 76-16.97\u224859.03.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately.\n\n\u221a72 = sqrt(36*2) = 6*sqrt(2) \u22486 *1.4142 \u22488.4852.\n\nSo 2*sqrt(72) \u224816.9704.\n\nSo x=72 -16.9704 +4 = (72+4) -16.9704 = 76 -16.9704 \u224859.0296.\n\nSo x is approximately 59.03 at n=72.\n\nBut wait, wait, that's the upper limit. But what about the lower limit at n=36, we got x=28. So x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 28 < x <60. So 28 is the lower bound, and 60 is the upper. Since 59.03 is less than 60, that would fit in D.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the substitution earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, when I simplified x, I got x = n -2\u221an +4.\n\nLet me check the simplification again. The numerator was (t+2)^2 (t^2 - 2t +4), denominator (t+2)^2, so x = t^2 - 2t +4. Since t=\u221an, t^2 is n, and -2t is -2\u221an. So yes, x= n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nSo when n is 36, x is 36 -12 +4=28.\n\nWhen n is 72, x is 72 - 2*sqrt(72)+4.\n\nWait, wait, sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)=approx 8.485, so 2*sqrt(72)=16.97. So 72-16.97=55.03; 55.03 +4=59.03.\n\nSo the maximum x is about 59.03, the minimum is 28.\n\nSo the range is 28 < x < ~59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 < x <54 \u2192 54 is less than 59.03, so our upper limit is higher than 54. So this can't be the right option.\n\nB)23 <x<58 \u2192 58 is less than 59.03. So our upper limit is a bit over 58, so the actual x can go up to ~59, which is beyond 58. So option B's upper limit is too low.\n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2192 64 is higher than 59, so x would fall within this. But the lower limit is 25, which is higher than our x's lower limit of 28. So some x's (those between 28 and 25) would not fit in option C. Wait, but 28 is higher than 25, so all x's are above 25. So the lower limit of C is 25, which is lower than our x's minimum of 28. So the x is between 28 and 59.03, which is within 25 to 64. But wait, the option C is 25 <x<64. So x can go as low as 28, which is above 25, so the lower limit is satisfied. The upper limit is 64, which is higher than 59, so yes. So option C's range includes all x's. But wait, but option D is more precise.\n\nOption D is 28 <x<60. So our x is between 28 and ~59.03, so 28 <x<60 is correct because 59.03 is less than 60.\n\nOption E is none of these.\n\nSo the correct option is D.\n\nWait, but let me check: does x reach exactly 28 or just above it? Because at n=36, x is exactly 28. So the lower bound is 28. But the options are written as 28 <x, not \u2264. So for n=36, x=28. So does the inequality allow x to be equal to 28? The question says 36 \u2264n \u226472, which includes n=36. So x can be 28. So the interval would be x \u226528 and x \u226459.03. But the options are written as \"satisfies\" which is an inequality. The options are all in the form of a <x< b.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says 28 <x<60. So x can be equal to 28, but the option D starts at 28 <x. So when n=36, x=28, which is not included in option D. So this might be a problem.\n\nWait, let me think. The question says, \"satisfies\", which implies x is in that interval. So if x can be 28, then the interval should include 28. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption D is 28 <x<60. So 28 is not included. But when n=36, x=28. So x can be exactly 28. So the correct interval would have to include 28. So the options would need to have an option that includes 28, but the options only have open intervals.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says 36 \u2264n \u226472. So n=36 is allowed, leading to x=28. So x can be 28, but the options don't have 28 \u2264x<60. Instead, option D is 28<x<60, which excludes 28. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the simplification.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error when simplifying the expression. Let me go back.\n\nOriginal expression: x = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding the numerator. Let me re-examine that.\n\nWait, numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nLet me expand 2\u221an(n+4) as 2\u221an *n + 2\u221an *4.\n\nWhich is 2n^(3/2) + 8\u221an.\n\nSo the numerator becomes n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write the numerator as (n + something)^2. Let me see.\n\nLet me see if it's a perfect square. Let me assume it's (n + a\u221an + b)^2.\n\nExpanding (n + a\u221an + b)^2:\n\n= n^2 + 2a n^(3/2) + (a\u00b2 + 2b) n + 2ab\u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nHmm, comparing this to the numerator, which is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nWait, the numerator doesn't have an n term, so the coefficient of n must be zero. So the expansion must have:\n\nn^2 + 2a n^(3/2) + (a\u00b2 + 2b) n + 2ab\u221an + b^2 = n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo, setting coefficients equal:\n\n- Coefficient of n^2: 1, which matches.\n- Coefficient of n^(3/2): 2a =2 \u2192 a=1.\n- Coefficient of n: a\u00b2 + 2b = 0 \u2192 since a=1, 1 + 2b=0 \u2192 b= -0.5.\n- Coefficient of \u221an: 2ab =8 \u2192 2*(1)*(-0.5) = -1, but in the numerator it's +8. That's a problem. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's (n + something)^2 plus another term. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the substitution.\n\nWait, earlier I thought the numerator was (t+2)^2 (t^2 - 2t +4), but maybe I should recheck that.\n\nLet me compute (t+2)^2 (t^2 -2t +4):\n\n= (t^2 +4t +4) (t^2 -2t +4)\nMultiply them out:\n\nFirst, t^2 * t^2 = t^4.\nt^2*(-2t) = -2t^3.\nt^2*4 =4t^2.\n\n4t *t^2=4t^3.\n4t*(-2t) = -8t^2.\n4t*4=16t.\n\n4 *t^2=4t^2.\n4*(-2t) =-8t.\n4*4=16.\n\nNow, adding all terms:\n\nt^4\n-2t^3 +4t^3 = 2t^3\n4t^2 -8t^2 +4t^2 =0t^2\n16t -8t =8t\n+16.\n\nSo overall, t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nWhich matches the numerator when expressed in terms of t.\n\nSo that's correct. So the numerator is (t+2)^2 (t^2 -2t +4), and the denominator is (t+2)^2. So x= t^2 -2t +4.\n\nWait, but when t=\u221an, x= (\u221an)^2 -2\u221an +4 \u2192 n -2\u221an +4.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo when n=36, x=36-12+4=28.\n\nAt n=36, x=28.\n\nBut the option D is 28 <x <60. So the lower bound is exclusive. So when x=28, it's not included in D, but it's possible. So that suggests that option E (none) might be the correct choice.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the maximum x. Let me check that again.\n\nAt n=72, x=72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4.\n\nAs sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485.\n\nSo 2*sqrt(72)= ~16.97.\n\nSo 72-16.97=55.03, plus 4 is 59.03.\n\nSo x is approximately 59.03.\n\nSo the range is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 No, because 59.03 is higher than 54.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 No, because x can be up to 59.03.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 Yes, because 28 is within 25 to 64, and 59.03 is less than 64.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 Yes, because 28 is excluded but x can be 28, but D's upper limit is 60, which is higher than 59.03.\n\nWait, but the problem is that option D's lower limit is 28 <x, which doesn't include x=28. But when n=36, x=28. So the correct range includes x=28, so the correct interval should be 28 \u2264x \u226459.03.\n\nLooking at the options, none of them include 28. Option D is 28 <x <60, which excludes x=28, but in reality x can be 28. So the correct interval would not be captured by any of the options except E.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The question says, \"satisfies\". So for n=36, x=28. So the correct interval must include 28. So none of the options A to D include 28 in their lower bound except perhaps C, which starts at 25, but D starts at 28 (exclusive). So let me look at the options again.\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64. So 28 is within this, and 59.03 is also within. So the entire range of x is within option C.\n\nBut wait, option D is 28 <x <60. So x can be as low as 28 (when n=36), but the option D doesn't include 28. So for x=28, the correct interval isn't captured by D, but is captured by C.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that option D was correct because when n=36, x=28, but according to the options, only when x>28 and <60, which would exclude x=28. So that would mean the correct option is E, none of these.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The question is asking for the interval that x satisfies. So when x=28, it's not included in D's interval. So the correct interval would have to include 28.\n\nLooking at the options, only option C includes 28 in its range. Because 25 <28 <64.\n\nWait, but when x=28, it's at the lower end. So the interval is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03. So which option includes all possible x?\n\nOption C is 25 <x <64. So yes, all x's are within that. So x=28 is within option C. So why did I think option D was correct earlier?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the initial calculation. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the denominator is n +4\u221an +4, which is (sqrt(n) + 2)^2.\n\nWait, yes, because (sqrt(n) + 2)^2 = n +4sqrt(n) +4.\n\nSo the denominator is (sqrt(n) +2)^2, and the numerator, as we saw, is (sqrt(n)+2)^2 (sqrt(n)^2 - 2*sqrt(n) +4).\n\nSo x is [ (sqrt(n)+2)^2 (sqrt(n)^2 -2sqrt(n) +4) ] / (sqrt(n)+2)^2.\n\nSo x = sqrt(n)^2 -2sqrt(n) +4 =n -2sqrt(n) +4.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo when n=36, x=36-12+4=28.\n\nAt n=36, x=28. So x can be as low as 28 and as high as approximately 59.03.\n\nSo the possible x's are between 28 and ~59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 includes all x's except when x=28. But x can be 28, so the correct interval should include 28.\n\nSo none of the options include 28 as an inclusive lower bound. So the only option that includes all possible x's is C, which is 25 <x <64.\n\nWait, but x can't be lower than 28, as the minimum x is 28. So option C's lower bound of 25 is acceptable because all x's are \u226528, which is within 25 <x <64.\n\nSo in that case, option C includes all possible x's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. For n=36, x=28. So 28 is included in option C, as 28>25. So all x's are in C.\n\nBut earlier, I thought option D was correct, but I'm getting confused now.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute x for n=36 and n=72 and see where they fall.\n\nAt n=36: x=28. So x=28.\n\nAt n=72: x\u224859.03.\n\nSo the x ranges from 28 to ~59.03.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 No, since 59.03>54.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 No, since x can be up to ~59.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 Yes, because 28 and 59.03 are within this range.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 No, because x can be 28, which is not included in D.\n\nE)None of these.\n\nSo option C includes all possible x's. But wait, earlier I thought x could be 28, which is included in option C's interval.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The question says \"satisfies\", which would mean that x is in that interval for all n in 36 to 72.\n\nSo for all n in 36\u2264n\u226472, x is in option C.\n\nWait, but when n=36, x=28, which is greater than 25 and less than 64. So yes, option C is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that option D was correct. So I'm getting conflicting thoughts here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial substitution. Let me double-check the substitution again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute x for another value of n to see.\n\nLet me take n=49. Then sqrt(49)=7.\n\nx=49 - 2*7 +4 =49-14+4=39.\n\nSo 39 is between 28 and 59.03. So it's within option D and C.\n\nAnother example: n=64. sqrt(64)=8.\n\nx=64 -2*8 +4=64-16+4=52.\n\nWhich is within both C and D.\n\nWait, but when n=36, x=28. So if I have to choose between C and D, which is correct.\n\nThe problem is that the correct x's range is from 28 to about 59.03. So:\n\n- Option C: 25 <x <64 \u2192 includes all x's, including 28 and 59.03.\n\n- Option D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 includes x's greater than 28 up to 60. So it excludes x=28.\n\nSo the correct answer depends on whether x can be equal to 28. Since n can be 36, which makes x=28, the correct interval must include 28.\n\nSo the only option that includes 28 is option C. Because 28 is between 25 and 64.\n\nWait, but wait, option D is 28 <x <60. So x can be 29 up to 59.99, which is within 60. So that would include x=29,30,...59.03.\n\nBut the actual x's include x=28, which is not included in D. So the correct option would have to include 28.\n\nSo the only option that includes 28 is C, which is 25 <x <64.\n\nBut wait, let me check the problem statement again. It says 36 \u2264n \u226472, so n=36 is allowed. Thus, x=28 is allowed.\n\nSo the x ranges from 28 to about 59.03. So the correct interval must include 28.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 No.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 No, because 59.03>58.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 Yes, because 28 is in this range and 59.03 is also in this range.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 No, because x can be 28.\n\nE)None of these \u2192 Only if none of the options fit.\n\nWait, but option C includes all x's. So the correct answer should be C.\n\nBut earlier I thought D was correct. So I'm getting a bit confused. Let me make a table.\n\nn | x\n\n36 |28\n\n49 |39\n\n64 |52\n\n72 |59.03\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to about 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20-54 \u2192 No, because x can be up to 59.03.\n\nB)23-58 \u2192 No, because x can be 59.03.\n\nC)25-64 \u2192 Yes, because 28 is above 25 and 59.03 is below 64.\n\nD)28-60 \u2192 No, because x can be 28, which is excluded.\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought option D was correct. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me re-express x as n - 2\u221an +4 and see how it behaves.\n\nWait, let me compute x when n=36: 36-12+4=28.\n\nAt n=36, x=28.\n\nAt n=72, x=72 -2*sqrt(72)+4.\n\nAs before, sqrt(72)=6*1.414=8.485.\n\nSo x=72 -16.97 +4=59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to 59.03.\n\nSo the options are:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 No.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 No, because 59.03 is above 58.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 Yes, because 28 is above 25 and 59.03 is below 64.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 No, because x can be 28, which is not included.\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Earlier, I thought that the correct answer is D, but now I'm seeing that option C includes all possible x's.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the function x = n - 2\u221an +4 as n increases from 36 to 72.\n\nThe function x increases as n increases because the derivative dx/dn would be 1 - (1/\u221an) +0.\n\nWait, because x = n -2\u221an +4.\n\nThe derivative of x with respect to n is:\n\ndx/dn = 1 - (2*(1/(2\u221an))) ) = 1 - (1/\u221an).\n\nFor n \u226536, \u221an \u22656, so 1/\u221an \u22641/6 \u22480.1667.\n\nSo 1 - 0.1667 \u22480.8333>0. So the function x is increasing in n.\n\nSo as n increases from 36 to72, x increases from 28 to ~59.03.\n\nSo the minimum x is 28, maximum x is ~59.03.\n\nSo the possible x's are in [28,59.03].\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 includes all x's.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 includes all x's except x=28.\n\nSo the correct interval is x\u226528 and x\u226459.03.\n\nSo the correct option should be C, because it's the only one that includes all possible x's, including 28.\n\nBut earlier I thought option D was correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem states 36 \u2264n \u226472, which includes n=36, so x=28 is allowed. So the correct interval must include x=28. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option C is 25 <x <64. So 28 is within this range. So yes, option C is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that option D was correct. So I'm getting conflicting conclusions.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial substitution. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the problem states that x equals that expression. Did I correctly simplify it?\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4].\n\nI substituted \u221an =t, so n =t\u00b2.\n\nNumerator becomes t^4 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16 = t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nDenominator becomes t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2.\n\nThen, I factored the numerator as (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4), which when divided by (t+2)^2 gives t\u00b2 -2t +4 =n -2\u221an +4.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo x =n -2\u221an +4.\n\nThus, for n=36, x=28.\n\nSo the correct interval must include x=28.\n\nSo the only option that includes x=28 is option C, because option D starts at 28 <x.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but let me look at the options again.\n\nOption C:25 <x <64.\n\nYes, because 28 is greater than 25 and 59.03 is less than 64. So all x's fall within option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n",

Substituting into the expression:\n\n- **Numerator**:  \n  \\[\n  n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 = t^4 + 2t(t^2 + 4) + 16 = t^4 + 2t^3 + 8t + 16\n  \\]\n\n- **Denominator**:  \n  \\[\n  n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4 = t^2 + 4t + 4 = (t + 2)^2\n  \\]\n\nThe numerator can be factored as \\( (t + 2)^2(t^2 - 2t + 4) \\). Thus, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(t + 2)^2(t^2 - 2t + 4)}{(t + 2)^2} = t^2 - 2t + 4\n\\]\n\nSince \\( t = \\sqrt{n} \\), we have:\n\n\\[\nx = n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Range of \\( x \\)\nGiven \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\), we calculate \\( x \\) at the endpoints:\n\n1. **At \\( n = 36 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   x = 36 - 2\\sqrt{36} + 4 = 36 - 12 + 4 = 28\n   \\]\n\n2. **At \\( n = 72 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{72} \\approx 8.485, \\quad x = 72 - 2(8.485) + 4 = 72 - 16.97 + 4 \\approx 59.03\n   \\]\n\nThus, \\( x \\) ranges from \\( 28 \\) to approximately \\( 59.03 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Options\nThe options are:\n\n- **A)** \\( 20 < x < 54 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x \\) can exceed \\( 54 \\) (e.g., \\( x \\approx 59.03 \\)).\n- **B)** \\( 23 < x < 58 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x \\) can exceed \\( 58 \\) (e.g., \\( x \\approx 59.03 \\)).\n- **C)** \\( 25 < x < 64 \\): Correct, as \\( x \\) ranges from \\( 28 \\) to \\( 59.03 \\), which is entirely within this interval.\n- **D)** \\( 28 < x < 60 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x = 28 \\) is excluded (the interval is open at \\( 28 \\)), but \\( x = 28 \\) is valid when \\( n = 36 \\).\n- **E)** None of these: Incorrect, as option C is valid.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct interval is \\( 25 < x < 64 \\), which corresponds to **Option C**.\n\n**Answer: C**",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this algebra problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: If n is such that 36 \u2264 n \u2264 72, then x equals (n squared plus 2 times the square root of n times (n plus 4) plus 16) divided by (n plus 4 times the square root of n plus 4). We need to find which interval x falls into. The options are A to E, with E being none of these.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's write down the expression for x to get a clearer picture.\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16] / [n + 4\u221an + 4]\n\nWait, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify it. Let me think about whether the numerator and denominator can be factored or rewritten in a way that makes it easier.\n\nLooking at the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) + 16. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in terms of \u221an. Let me see. Let me denote \u221an as t, so t = \u221an. Then n = t\u00b2. Let's substitute that into the numerator.\n\nSo, numerator becomes t^4 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) + 16. Let me expand that:\n\nt^4 + 2t*(t\u00b2) + 2t*(4) +16\n= t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem to factor easily. Maybe I made a mistake in substitution. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the original numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let me expand that 2\u221an(n+4) term.\n\n2\u221an * n = 2n^(3/2)\n2\u221an * 4 = 8\u221an\nSo the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's not the easiest way. Maybe the denominator can be rewritten as well. The denominator is n +4\u221an +4. Let me see if that's a perfect square or something.\n\nWait, n is t\u00b2, so denominator becomes t\u00b2 +4t +4. Oh, that's (t+2)^2. Because (t+2)^2 = t\u00b2 +4t +4. Oh, that's a good catch! So the denominator is (t+2)^2, where t is \u221an.\n\nNow, what about the numerator? Let's express it in terms of t again.\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16 = (t^2)^2 + 2t*(t^2 +4) +16.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\nt^4 + 2t*(t^2) + 2t*(4) +16\n= t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nHmm, I'm trying to see if this can be factored. Let me think. Maybe group terms?\n\nt^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nLet me group the first two terms and the last two:\n\n(t^4 + 2t^3) + (8t +16)\n= t^3(t + 2) + 8(t + 2)\n= (t^3 +8)(t + 2)\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, t^4 + 2t^3 = t^3(t + 2)\nAnd 8t +16 = 8(t + 2)\nSo factoring (t + 2) gives:\n\n(t + 2)(t^3 +8)\n\nAh, yes! Because t^3 +8 is a sum of cubes. Remember, a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2).\n\nSo, t^3 +8 = (t + 2)(t^2 - 2t +4). So putting it all together:\n\nNumerator = (t + 2)(t^3 +8) = (t +2)(t +2)(t^2 -2t +4) = (t +2)^2 (t^2 -2t +4).\n\nWait, no, wait. Because (t +2)(t^3 +8) = (t +2)(t +2)(t^2 - 2t +4) since t^3 +8 factors as (t+2)(t^2 -2t +4). So the numerator is (t+2)^2 (t^2 -2t +4).\n\nSo, numerator is (t+2)^2 (t^2 -2t +4), and denominator is (t+2)^2. So when we take the ratio, the (t+2)^2 terms cancel out.\n\nSo x = [ (t+2)^2 (t^2 - 2t +4) ] / (t+2)^2 ) = t^2 -2t +4.\n\nBut since t is \u221an, t^2 is n. So x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, that's a much simpler expression! So x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nNow, the problem states that n is between 36 and 72, inclusive. So n can be as low as 36 and as high as 72.\n\nWe need to find the range of x in this interval.\n\nSo x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nLet me think about how x behaves as n changes from 36 to 72.\n\nLet me compute x at n=36 and n=72.\n\nFirst, at n=36:\n\n\u221a36 =6.\n\nSo x=36 -2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nAt n=72:\n\n\u221a72 is approximately 8.485 (since 8^2=64, 9^2=81, so 8.485^2 \u224872).\n\nSo x=72 -2*8.485 +4 = 72 -16.97 +4 = 72+4=76; 76-16.97\u224859.03.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately.\n\n\u221a72 = sqrt(36*2) = 6*sqrt(2) \u22486 *1.4142 \u22488.4852.\n\nSo 2*sqrt(72) \u224816.9704.\n\nSo x=72 -16.9704 +4 = (72+4) -16.9704 = 76 -16.9704 \u224859.0296.\n\nSo x is approximately 59.03 at n=72.\n\nBut wait, wait, that's the upper limit. But what about the lower limit at n=36, we got x=28. So x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 28 < x <60. So 28 is the lower bound, and 60 is the upper. Since 59.03 is less than 60, that would fit in D.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the substitution earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, when I simplified x, I got x = n -2\u221an +4.\n\nLet me check the simplification again. The numerator was (t+2)^2 (t^2 - 2t +4), denominator (t+2)^2, so x = t^2 - 2t +4. Since t=\u221an, t^2 is n, and -2t is -2\u221an. So yes, x= n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nSo when n is 36, x is 36 -12 +4=28.\n\nWhen n is 72, x is 72 - 2*sqrt(72)+4.\n\nWait, wait, sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)=approx 8.485, so 2*sqrt(72)=16.97. So 72-16.97=55.03; 55.03 +4=59.03.\n\nSo the maximum x is about 59.03, the minimum is 28.\n\nSo the range is 28 < x < ~59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 < x <54 \u2192 54 is less than 59.03, so our upper limit is higher than 54. So this can't be the right option.\n\nB)23 <x<58 \u2192 58 is less than 59.03. So our upper limit is a bit over 58, so the actual x can go up to ~59, which is beyond 58. So option B's upper limit is too low.\n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2192 64 is higher than 59, so x would fall within this. But the lower limit is 25, which is higher than our x's lower limit of 28. So some x's (those between 28 and 25) would not fit in option C. Wait, but 28 is higher than 25, so all x's are above 25. So the lower limit of C is 25, which is lower than our x's minimum of 28. So the x is between 28 and 59.03, which is within 25 to 64. But wait, the option C is 25 <x<64. So x can go as low as 28, which is above 25, so the lower limit is satisfied. The upper limit is 64, which is higher than 59, so yes. So option C's range includes all x's. But wait, but option D is more precise.\n\nOption D is 28 <x<60. So our x is between 28 and ~59.03, so 28 <x<60 is correct because 59.03 is less than 60.\n\nOption E is none of these.\n\nSo the correct option is D.\n\nWait, but let me check: does x reach exactly 28 or just above it? Because at n=36, x is exactly 28. So the lower bound is 28. But the options are written as 28 <x, not \u2264. So for n=36, x=28. So does the inequality allow x to be equal to 28? The question says 36 \u2264n \u226472, which includes n=36. So x can be 28. So the interval would be x \u226528 and x \u226459.03. But the options are written as \"satisfies\" which is an inequality. The options are all in the form of a <x< b.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says 28 <x<60. So x can be equal to 28, but the option D starts at 28 <x. So when n=36, x=28, which is not included in option D. So this might be a problem.\n\nWait, let me think. The question says, \"satisfies\", which implies x is in that interval. So if x can be 28, then the interval should include 28. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption D is 28 <x<60. So 28 is not included. But when n=36, x=28. So x can be exactly 28. So the correct interval would have to include 28. So the options would need to have an option that includes 28, but the options only have open intervals.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says 36 \u2264n \u226472. So n=36 is allowed, leading to x=28. So x can be 28, but the options don't have 28 \u2264x<60. Instead, option D is 28<x<60, which excludes 28. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the simplification.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error when simplifying the expression. Let me go back.\n\nOriginal expression: x = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding the numerator. Let me re-examine that.\n\nWait, numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nLet me expand 2\u221an(n+4) as 2\u221an *n + 2\u221an *4.\n\nWhich is 2n^(3/2) + 8\u221an.\n\nSo the numerator becomes n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write the numerator as (n + something)^2. Let me see.\n\nLet me see if it's a perfect square. Let me assume it's (n + a\u221an + b)^2.\n\nExpanding (n + a\u221an + b)^2:\n\n= n^2 + 2a n^(3/2) + (a\u00b2 + 2b) n + 2ab\u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nHmm, comparing this to the numerator, which is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nWait, the numerator doesn't have an n term, so the coefficient of n must be zero. So the expansion must have:\n\nn^2 + 2a n^(3/2) + (a\u00b2 + 2b) n + 2ab\u221an + b^2 = n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo, setting coefficients equal:\n\n- Coefficient of n^2: 1, which matches.\n- Coefficient of n^(3/2): 2a =2 \u2192 a=1.\n- Coefficient of n: a\u00b2 + 2b = 0 \u2192 since a=1, 1 + 2b=0 \u2192 b= -0.5.\n- Coefficient of \u221an: 2ab =8 \u2192 2*(1)*(-0.5) = -1, but in the numerator it's +8. That's a problem. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's (n + something)^2 plus another term. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the substitution.\n\nWait, earlier I thought the numerator was (t+2)^2 (t^2 - 2t +4), but maybe I should recheck that.\n\nLet me compute (t+2)^2 (t^2 -2t +4):\n\n= (t^2 +4t +4) (t^2 -2t +4)\nMultiply them out:\n\nFirst, t^2 * t^2 = t^4.\nt^2*(-2t) = -2t^3.\nt^2*4 =4t^2.\n\n4t *t^2=4t^3.\n4t*(-2t) = -8t^2.\n4t*4=16t.\n\n4 *t^2=4t^2.\n4*(-2t) =-8t.\n4*4=16.\n\nNow, adding all terms:\n\nt^4\n-2t^3 +4t^3 = 2t^3\n4t^2 -8t^2 +4t^2 =0t^2\n16t -8t =8t\n+16.\n\nSo overall, t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nWhich matches the numerator when expressed in terms of t.\n\nSo that's correct. So the numerator is (t+2)^2 (t^2 -2t +4), and the denominator is (t+2)^2. So x= t^2 -2t +4.\n\nWait, but when t=\u221an, x= (\u221an)^2 -2\u221an +4 \u2192 n -2\u221an +4.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo when n=36, x=36-12+4=28.\n\nAt n=36, x=28.\n\nBut the option D is 28 <x <60. So the lower bound is exclusive. So when x=28, it's not included in D, but it's possible. So that suggests that option E (none) might be the correct choice.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the maximum x. Let me check that again.\n\nAt n=72, x=72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4.\n\nAs sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485.\n\nSo 2*sqrt(72)= ~16.97.\n\nSo 72-16.97=55.03, plus 4 is 59.03.\n\nSo x is approximately 59.03.\n\nSo the range is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 No, because 59.03 is higher than 54.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 No, because x can be up to 59.03.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 Yes, because 28 is within 25 to 64, and 59.03 is less than 64.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 Yes, because 28 is excluded but x can be 28, but D's upper limit is 60, which is higher than 59.03.\n\nWait, but the problem is that option D's lower limit is 28 <x, which doesn't include x=28. But when n=36, x=28. So the correct range includes x=28, so the correct interval should be 28 \u2264x \u226459.03.\n\nLooking at the options, none of them include 28. Option D is 28 <x <60, which excludes x=28, but in reality x can be 28. So the correct interval would not be captured by any of the options except E.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The question says, \"satisfies\". So for n=36, x=28. So the correct interval must include 28. So none of the options A to D include 28 in their lower bound except perhaps C, which starts at 25, but D starts at 28 (exclusive). So let me look at the options again.\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64. So 28 is within this, and 59.03 is also within. So the entire range of x is within option C.\n\nBut wait, option D is 28 <x <60. So x can be as low as 28 (when n=36), but the option D doesn't include 28. So for x=28, the correct interval isn't captured by D, but is captured by C.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that option D was correct because when n=36, x=28, but according to the options, only when x>28 and <60, which would exclude x=28. So that would mean the correct option is E, none of these.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The question is asking for the interval that x satisfies. So when x=28, it's not included in D's interval. So the correct interval would have to include 28.\n\nLooking at the options, only option C includes 28 in its range. Because 25 <28 <64.\n\nWait, but when x=28, it's at the lower end. So the interval is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03. So which option includes all possible x?\n\nOption C is 25 <x <64. So yes, all x's are within that. So x=28 is within option C. So why did I think option D was correct earlier?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the initial calculation. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the denominator is n +4\u221an +4, which is (sqrt(n) + 2)^2.\n\nWait, yes, because (sqrt(n) + 2)^2 = n +4sqrt(n) +4.\n\nSo the denominator is (sqrt(n) +2)^2, and the numerator, as we saw, is (sqrt(n)+2)^2 (sqrt(n)^2 - 2*sqrt(n) +4).\n\nSo x is [ (sqrt(n)+2)^2 (sqrt(n)^2 -2sqrt(n) +4) ] / (sqrt(n)+2)^2.\n\nSo x = sqrt(n)^2 -2sqrt(n) +4 =n -2sqrt(n) +4.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo when n=36, x=36-12+4=28.\n\nAt n=36, x=28. So x can be as low as 28 and as high as approximately 59.03.\n\nSo the possible x's are between 28 and ~59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 includes all x's except when x=28. But x can be 28, so the correct interval should include 28.\n\nSo none of the options include 28 as an inclusive lower bound. So the only option that includes all possible x's is C, which is 25 <x <64.\n\nWait, but x can't be lower than 28, as the minimum x is 28. So option C's lower bound of 25 is acceptable because all x's are \u226528, which is within 25 <x <64.\n\nSo in that case, option C includes all possible x's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. For n=36, x=28. So 28 is included in option C, as 28>25. So all x's are in C.\n\nBut earlier, I thought option D was correct, but I'm getting confused now.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute x for n=36 and n=72 and see where they fall.\n\nAt n=36: x=28. So x=28.\n\nAt n=72: x\u224859.03.\n\nSo the x ranges from 28 to ~59.03.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 No, since 59.03>54.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 No, since x can be up to ~59.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 Yes, because 28 and 59.03 are within this range.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 No, because x can be 28, which is not included in D.\n\nE)None of these.\n\nSo option C includes all possible x's. But wait, earlier I thought x could be 28, which is included in option C's interval.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The question says \"satisfies\", which would mean that x is in that interval for all n in 36 to 72.\n\nSo for all n in 36\u2264n\u226472, x is in option C.\n\nWait, but when n=36, x=28, which is greater than 25 and less than 64. So yes, option C is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that option D was correct. So I'm getting conflicting thoughts here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial substitution. Let me double-check the substitution again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute x for another value of n to see.\n\nLet me take n=49. Then sqrt(49)=7.\n\nx=49 - 2*7 +4 =49-14+4=39.\n\nSo 39 is between 28 and 59.03. So it's within option D and C.\n\nAnother example: n=64. sqrt(64)=8.\n\nx=64 -2*8 +4=64-16+4=52.\n\nWhich is within both C and D.\n\nWait, but when n=36, x=28. So if I have to choose between C and D, which is correct.\n\nThe problem is that the correct x's range is from 28 to about 59.03. So:\n\n- Option C: 25 <x <64 \u2192 includes all x's, including 28 and 59.03.\n\n- Option D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 includes x's greater than 28 up to 60. So it excludes x=28.\n\nSo the correct answer depends on whether x can be equal to 28. Since n can be 36, which makes x=28, the correct interval must include 28.\n\nSo the only option that includes 28 is option C. Because 28 is between 25 and 64.\n\nWait, but wait, option D is 28 <x <60. So x can be 29 up to 59.99, which is within 60. So that would include x=29,30,...59.03.\n\nBut the actual x's include x=28, which is not included in D. So the correct option would have to include 28.\n\nSo the only option that includes 28 is C, which is 25 <x <64.\n\nBut wait, let me check the problem statement again. It says 36 \u2264n \u226472, so n=36 is allowed. Thus, x=28 is allowed.\n\nSo the x ranges from 28 to about 59.03. So the correct interval must include 28.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 No.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 No, because 59.03>58.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 Yes, because 28 is in this range and 59.03 is also in this range.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 No, because x can be 28.\n\nE)None of these \u2192 Only if none of the options fit.\n\nWait, but option C includes all x's. So the correct answer should be C.\n\nBut earlier I thought D was correct. So I'm getting a bit confused. Let me make a table.\n\nn | x\n\n36 |28\n\n49 |39\n\n64 |52\n\n72 |59.03\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to about 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20-54 \u2192 No, because x can be up to 59.03.\n\nB)23-58 \u2192 No, because x can be 59.03.\n\nC)25-64 \u2192 Yes, because 28 is above 25 and 59.03 is below 64.\n\nD)28-60 \u2192 No, because x can be 28, which is excluded.\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought option D was correct. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me re-express x as n - 2\u221an +4 and see how it behaves.\n\nWait, let me compute x when n=36: 36-12+4=28.\n\nAt n=36, x=28.\n\nAt n=72, x=72 -2*sqrt(72)+4.\n\nAs before, sqrt(72)=6*1.414=8.485.\n\nSo x=72 -16.97 +4=59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to 59.03.\n\nSo the options are:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 No.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 No, because 59.03 is above 58.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 Yes, because 28 is above 25 and 59.03 is below 64.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 No, because x can be 28, which is not included.\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Earlier, I thought that the correct answer is D, but now I'm seeing that option C includes all possible x's.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the function x = n - 2\u221an +4 as n increases from 36 to 72.\n\nThe function x increases as n increases because the derivative dx/dn would be 1 - (1/\u221an) +0.\n\nWait, because x = n -2\u221an +4.\n\nThe derivative of x with respect to n is:\n\ndx/dn = 1 - (2*(1/(2\u221an))) ) = 1 - (1/\u221an).\n\nFor n \u226536, \u221an \u22656, so 1/\u221an \u22641/6 \u22480.1667.\n\nSo 1 - 0.1667 \u22480.8333>0. So the function x is increasing in n.\n\nSo as n increases from 36 to72, x increases from 28 to ~59.03.\n\nSo the minimum x is 28, maximum x is ~59.03.\n\nSo the possible x's are in [28,59.03].\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 includes all x's.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 includes all x's except x=28.\n\nSo the correct interval is x\u226528 and x\u226459.03.\n\nSo the correct option should be C, because it's the only one that includes all possible x's, including 28.\n\nBut earlier I thought option D was correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem states 36 \u2264n \u226472, which includes n=36, so x=28 is allowed. So the correct interval must include x=28. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option C is 25 <x <64. So 28 is within this range. So yes, option C is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that option D was correct. So I'm getting conflicting conclusions.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial substitution. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the problem states that x equals that expression. Did I correctly simplify it?\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4].\n\nI substituted \u221an =t, so n =t\u00b2.\n\nNumerator becomes t^4 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16 = t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nDenominator becomes t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2.\n\nThen, I factored the numerator as (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4), which when divided by (t+2)^2 gives t\u00b2 -2t +4 =n -2\u221an +4.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo x =n -2\u221an +4.\n\nThus, for n=36, x=28.\n\nSo the correct interval must include x=28.\n\nSo the only option that includes x=28 is option C, because option D starts at 28 <x.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but let me look at the options again.\n\nOption C:25 <x <64.\n\nYes, because 28 is greater than 25 and 59.03 is less than 64. So all x's fall within option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the given expression for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Expression\nLet \\( t = \\sqrt{n} \\), so \\( n = t^2 \\). Substituting into the expression:\n\n- **Numerator**:  \n  \\[\n  n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 = t^4 + 2t(t^2 + 4) + 16 = t^4 + 2t^3 + 8t + 16\n  \\]\n\n- **Denominator**:  \n  \\[\n  n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4 = t^2 + 4t + 4 = (t + 2)^2\n  \\]\n\nThe numerator can be factored as \\( (t + 2)^2(t^2 - 2t + 4) \\). Thus, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(t + 2)^2(t^2 - 2t + 4)}{(t + 2)^2} = t^2 - 2t + 4\n\\]\n\nSince \\( t = \\sqrt{n} \\), we have:\n\n\\[\nx = n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Range of \\( x \\)\nGiven \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\), we calculate \\( x \\) at the endpoints:\n\n1. **At \\( n = 36 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   x = 36 - 2\\sqrt{36} + 4 = 36 - 12 + 4 = 28\n   \\]\n\n2. **At \\( n = 72 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{72} \\approx 8.485, \\quad x = 72 - 2(8.485) + 4 = 72 - 16.97 + 4 \\approx 59.03\n   \\]\n\nThus, \\( x \\) ranges from \\( 28 \\) to approximately \\( 59.03 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Options\nThe options are:\n\n- **A)** \\( 20 < x < 54 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x \\) can exceed \\( 54 \\) (e.g., \\( x \\approx 59.03 \\)).\n- **B)** \\( 23 < x < 58 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x \\) can exceed \\( 58 \\) (e.g., \\( x \\approx 59.03 \\)).\n- **C)** \\( 25 < x < 64 \\): Correct, as \\( x \\) ranges from \\( 28 \\) to \\( 59.03 \\), which is entirely within this interval.\n- **D)** \\( 28 < x < 60 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x = 28 \\) is excluded (the interval is open at \\( 28 \\)), but \\( x = 28 \\) is valid when \\( n = 36 \\).\n- **E)** None of these: Incorrect, as option C is valid.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct interval is \\( 25 < x < 64 \\), which corresponds to **Option C**.\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this algebra problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says that n is between 36 and 72, inclusive. Then, there's this expression for x, which is (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16) divided by (n +4\u221an +4). I need to find which interval x falls into.\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify the numerator and the denominator. Let me write them out again.\n\nThe numerator is n squared plus 2 times the square root of n times (n plus 4), plus 16. The denominator is n plus 4 times the square root of n plus 4.\n\nWait, maybe the numerator and denominator can be factored or rewritten in a way that makes them simpler. Let me look at the numerator first: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nHmm, that looks almost like a perfect square. The form (a + b)^2 is a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nLet me try to think of a and b. The first term is n\u00b2, which is (n)^2. The last term is 16, which is 4\u00b2. So maybe a is n and b is 4. Then, 2ab would be 2 * n *4 = 8n. But in the numerator, the middle term is 2\u221an(n+4). Hmm, that's different. So maybe that approach isn't directly applicable.\n\nWait, another thought: the middle term is 2\u221an(n+4). Let's expand that. 2\u221an(n) is 2n\u221an, and 2\u221an(4) is 8\u221an. So the numerator becomes n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an +16. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I can group some terms differently. Let me see:\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16 = n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an +16.\n\nDenominator: n +4\u221an +4.\n\nHmm, perhaps the numerator can be written as (n + something)^2. Let me try to see.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me substitute \u221an with another variable. Let me set m = \u221an. Since n is between 36 and 72, m would be between 6 (sqrt(36)) and approximately 8.485 (sqrt(72)). So m is in [6, 8.485].\n\nLet me rewrite the expression in terms of m.\n\nn = m\u00b2, so numerator becomes m^4 + 2m*(m\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nLet me compute that: m^4 + 2m^3 + 8m +16.\n\nDenominator becomes m\u00b2 +4m +4.\n\nHmm, let's see if the denominator can be factored. m\u00b2 +4m +4 is (m+2)^2.\n\nSo denominator is (m+2)^2.\n\nNow the numerator is m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16.\n\nWait, can I factor that? Let me try to group terms.\n\nm^4 +2m^3 can be written as m^3(m + 2). 8m +16 is 8(m +2). So numerator becomes m^3(m + 2) +8(m +2) = (m +2)(m^3 +8).\n\nOh, that's interesting. So numerator is (m+2)(m^3 +8).\n\nWait, m^3 +8 is a sum of cubes, since 8 is 2^3. So m^3 +8 = (m +2)(m\u00b2 -2m +4).\n\nSo putting it all together, numerator is (m +2)*(m +2)*(m\u00b2 -2m +4) = (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4).\n\nDenominator is (m+2)^2.\n\nSo the entire expression x is numerator over denominator, which is [(m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4)] / (m+2)^2.\n\nThe (m+2)^2 terms cancel out, so x = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nWow, that simplifies things a lot. So x = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nNow, since m is sqrt(n), and n is between 36 and 72, m is between 6 and approximately 8.485. So m is in [6, sqrt(72)].\n\nWait, sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2) which is about 8.485, right.\n\nSo m is in [6, 8.485]. Let me compute x as a function of m: x = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nI can write this as x = (m\u00b2 -2m +1) +3 = (m-1)^2 +3.\n\nSo x is equal to (m-1)^2 plus 3. Since (m-1)^2 is always non-negative, the minimum value of x is 3, but given the range of m, x will be higher.\n\nWait, but let's compute the minimum and maximum possible x based on m in [6, 8.485].\n\nFirst, let's find x when m is 6.\n\nx = (6)^2 -2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nWait, wait, 36 minus 12 is 24, plus 4 is 28. So x is 28 when m=6.\n\nThen, when m is 8.485, let's compute x.\n\nm is approximately 8.485, let's compute m\u00b2: 8.485^2 is about 72, right? Because n is 72, which is m squared.\n\nWait, wait, m is sqrt(n), so for n=72, m is sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)=approx 8.485.\n\nSo m=8.485.\n\nSo m\u00b2 is 72.\n\nx=72 -2*(8.485) +4.\n\nCompute 2*(8.485) is 16.97.\n\n72 -16.97 is 55.03. Plus 4 is 59.03.\n\nWait, that's about 59.03.\n\nSo when m is at its maximum (n=72), x is approximately 59.03.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Let me recheck that calculation.\n\nWait, x = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nWhen m=8.485, m\u00b2=72.\n\nSo 72 - 2*(8.485) +4.\n\nSo 72 +4 =76. 2*8.485 is 16.97.\n\n76 -16.97=59.03.\n\nSo x is about 59.03.\n\nWait, but wait, when m is 6, x=28, and when m is 8.485, x is about 59.03.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right. Because when m increases, x increases as well?\n\nWait, the function x(m) = m\u00b2 -2m +4 is a quadratic in m, opening upwards. The vertex is at m=1, which is way below our m range. So in our m range [6,8.485], x(m) is increasing as m increases.\n\nWait, but let's take the derivative to confirm. The derivative of x with respect to m is 2m -2. Since m is at least 6, 2m-2 is 10, which is positive. So x is increasing with m.\n\nSo when m is 6, x is 28; when m is 8.485, x is about 59.03. So x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nSo x is between 28 and about 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options, option D says 28 < x <60. That would fit. Because 59.03 is less than 60.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake.\n\nWait, when m is 6, x is 6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 = 36-12+4=28. Correct.\n\nWhen m is 8.485, m\u00b2 is 72, so x=72 - 2*(8.485) +4 =72 +4 =76 minus 16.97 gives 59.03. So x is about 59.03.\n\nSo the range is 28 < x <59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 < x <54 \u2192 no, since x can be up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 x can be up to ~59, so 58 is too low on the upper end.\n\nC)25<x<64 \u2192 x starts at 28, so 25 is too low. Upper limit is 64, which is higher than 59.03, so x is within this range.\n\nWait, but wait. If the maximum x is about 59.03, then 64 is higher, but x never reaches 64. So the range for x is 28 to ~59.03.\n\nSo let's look at the options again.\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. So 28 is the lower bound, and 60 is just above 59.03. So x is between 28 and 60, but actually, it's up to about 59.03. So option D is 28 <x <60. That would include all x in our range.\n\nOption C is 25 <x <64. Since x starts at 28, which is higher than 25, so the lower bound is satisfied, but the upper bound is 64, which is higher than our maximum x. So C would include x up to 59.03, but the option's upper limit is 64, which is beyond. So the correct interval would be up to 59.03, but none of the options exactly match that.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA)20 < x <54 \u2192 no.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 no, because x can go up to 59.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, but 64 is beyond the maximum, but the x is less than 60, which is within 64. So does that make C correct?\n\nWait, but option D is 28 <x <60. Since x is at least 28 and less than 60, that would fit exactly.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The maximum x is about 59.03, so x is less than 60. So the upper limit is 60. So option D is 28 <x <60, which is correct.\n\nSo the correct option is D.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when m is at its maximum, x is 59.03, which is less than 60, so x is less than 60. So the upper bound of the option D is correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this algebra problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says that n is between 36 and 72, inclusive. Then, there's this expression for x, which is (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16) divided by (n +4\u221an +4). I need to find which interval x falls into.\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify the numerator and the denominator. Let me write them out again.\n\nThe numerator is n squared plus 2 times the square root of n times (n plus 4), plus 16. The denominator is n plus 4 times the square root of n plus 4.\n\nWait, maybe the numerator and denominator can be factored or rewritten in a way that makes them simpler. Let me look at the numerator first: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nHmm, that looks almost like a perfect square. The form (a + b)^2 is a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nLet me try to think of a and b. The first term is n\u00b2, which is (n)^2. The last term is 16, which is 4\u00b2. So maybe a is n and b is 4. Then, 2ab would be 2 * n *4 = 8n. But in the numerator, the middle term is 2\u221an(n+4). Hmm, that's different. So maybe that approach isn't directly applicable.\n\nWait, another thought: the middle term is 2\u221an(n+4). Let's expand that. 2\u221an(n) is 2n\u221an, and 2\u221an(4) is 8\u221an. So the numerator becomes n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an +16. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I can group some terms differently. Let me see:\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16 = n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an +16.\n\nDenominator: n +4\u221an +4.\n\nHmm, perhaps the numerator can be written as (n + something)^2. Let me try to see.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me substitute \u221an with another variable. Let me set m = \u221an. Since n is between 36 and 72, m would be between 6 (sqrt(36)) and approximately 8.485 (sqrt(72)). So m is in [6, 8.485].\n\nLet me rewrite the expression in terms of m.\n\nn = m\u00b2, so numerator becomes m^4 + 2m*(m\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nLet me compute that: m^4 + 2m^3 + 8m +16.\n\nDenominator becomes m\u00b2 +4m +4.\n\nHmm, let's see if the denominator can be factored. m\u00b2 +4m +4 is (m+2)^2.\n\nSo denominator is (m+2)^2.\n\nNow the numerator is m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16.\n\nWait, can I factor that? Let me try to group terms.\n\nm^4 +2m^3 can be written as m^3(m + 2). 8m +16 is 8(m +2). So numerator becomes m^3(m + 2) +8(m +2) = (m +2)(m^3 +8).\n\nOh, that's interesting. So numerator is (m+2)(m^3 +8).\n\nWait, m^3 +8 is a sum of cubes, since 8 is 2^3. So m^3 +8 = (m +2)(m\u00b2 -2m +4).\n\nSo putting it all together, numerator is (m +2)*(m +2)*(m\u00b2 -2m +4) = (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4).\n\nDenominator is (m+2)^2.\n\nSo the entire expression x is numerator over denominator, which is [(m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4)] / (m+2)^2.\n\nThe (m+2)^2 terms cancel out, so x = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nWow, that simplifies things a lot. So x = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nNow, since m is sqrt(n), and n is between 36 and 72, m is between 6 and approximately 8.485. So m is in [6, sqrt(72)].\n\nWait, sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2) which is about 8.485, right.\n\nSo m is in [6, 8.485]. Let me compute x as a function of m: x = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nI can write this as x = (m\u00b2 -2m +1) +3 = (m-1)^2 +3.\n\nSo x is equal to (m-1)^2 plus 3. Since (m-1)^2 is always non-negative, the minimum value of x is 3, but given the range of m, x will be higher.\n\nWait, but let's compute the minimum and maximum possible x based on m in [6, 8.485].\n\nFirst, let's find x when m is 6.\n\nx = (6)^2 -2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nWait, wait, 36 minus 12 is 24, plus 4 is 28. So x is 28 when m=6.\n\nThen, when m is 8.485, let's compute x.\n\nm is approximately 8.485, let's compute m\u00b2: 8.485^2 is about 72, right? Because n is 72, which is m squared.\n\nWait, wait, m is sqrt(n), so for n=72, m is sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)=approx 8.485.\n\nSo m=8.485.\n\nSo m\u00b2 is 72.\n\nx=72 -2*(8.485) +4.\n\nCompute 2*(8.485) is 16.97.\n\n72 -16.97 is 55.03. Plus 4 is 59.03.\n\nWait, that's about 59.03.\n\nSo when m is at its maximum (n=72), x is approximately 59.03.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Let me recheck that calculation.\n\nWait, x = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nWhen m=8.485, m\u00b2=72.\n\nSo 72 - 2*(8.485) +4.\n\nSo 72 +4 =76. 2*8.485 is 16.97.\n\n76 -16.97=59.03.\n\nSo x is about 59.03.\n\nWait, but wait, when m is 6, x=28, and when m is 8.485, x is about 59.03.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right. Because when m increases, x increases as well?\n\nWait, the function x(m) = m\u00b2 -2m +4 is a quadratic in m, opening upwards. The vertex is at m=1, which is way below our m range. So in our m range [6,8.485], x(m) is increasing as m increases.\n\nWait, but let's take the derivative to confirm. The derivative of x with respect to m is 2m -2. Since m is at least 6, 2m-2 is 10, which is positive. So x is increasing with m.\n\nSo when m is 6, x is 28; when m is 8.485, x is about 59.03. So x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nSo x is between 28 and about 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options, option D says 28 < x <60. That would fit. Because 59.03 is less than 60.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake.\n\nWait, when m is 6, x is 6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 = 36-12+4=28. Correct.\n\nWhen m is 8.485, m\u00b2 is 72, so x=72 - 2*(8.485) +4 =72 +4 =76 minus 16.97 gives 59.03. So x is about 59.03.\n\nSo the range is 28 < x <59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 < x <54 \u2192 no, since x can be up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 x can be up to ~59, so 58 is too low on the upper end.\n\nC)25<x<64 \u2192 x starts at 28, so 25 is too low. Upper limit is 64, which is higher than 59.03, so x is within this range.\n\nWait, but wait. If the maximum x is about 59.03, then 64 is higher, but x never reaches 64. So the range for x is 28 to ~59.03.\n\nSo let's look at the options again.\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. So 28 is the lower bound, and 60 is just above 59.03. So x is between 28 and 60, but actually, it's up to about 59.03. So option D is 28 <x <60. That would include all x in our range.\n\nOption C is 25 <x <64. Since x starts at 28, which is higher than 25, so the lower bound is satisfied, but the upper bound is 64, which is higher than our maximum x. So C would include x up to 59.03, but the option's upper limit is 64, which is beyond. So the correct interval would be up to 59.03, but none of the options exactly match that.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA)20 < x <54 \u2192 no.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 no, because x can go up to 59.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, but 64 is beyond the maximum, but the x is less than 60, which is within 64. So does that make C correct?\n\nWait, but option D is 28 <x <60. Since x is at least 28 and less than 60, that would fit exactly.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The maximum x is about 59.03, so x is less than 60. So the upper limit is 60. So option D is 28 <x <60, which is correct.\n\nSo the correct option is D.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when m is at its maximum, x is 59.03, which is less than 60, so x is less than 60. So the upper bound of the option D is correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is D.\n\n\nThe problem involves simplifying the expression for \\( x \\) given \\( n \\) in the range \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\). The expression for \\( x \\) is:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4}.\n\\]\n\nTo simplify, let \\( m = \\sqrt{n} \\), so \\( m \\in [6, 8.485] \\) since \\( n \\in [36, 72] \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this algebra problem here, and I need to figure out which option is correct for the given expression. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe question states: If n is such that 36 \u2264 n \u2264 72, then x equals (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16) divided by (n + 4\u221an + 4). We have to find which range x falls into.\n\nHmm. Alright, let's write down the expression again to get a clearer picture.\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16] / [n + 4\u221an +4]\n\nWait, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe it can be simplified. I notice that both the numerator and the denominator have terms involving n and \u221an. Perhaps there's a way to factor or rewrite this expression.\n\nLet me look at the numerator first. The numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Let me expand the 2\u221an(n +4) term. So that would be 2\u221an * n + 2\u221an *4 = 2n^(3/2) + 8\u221an.\n\nSo the numerator becomes: n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe it's a perfect square or can be expressed as a square of a binomial. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16. Let me try to group terms. Maybe group the first two and the last two terms.\n\nn\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) + (8\u221an +16). Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor as (n + a\u221an + b)\u00b2? Let me try expanding (n + a\u221an + b)\u00b2 and see if it matches the numerator.\n\nExpanding (n + a\u221an + b)^2: n\u00b2 + 2a n^(3/2) + (a\u00b2 + 2b) n + 2ab\u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nWait, but the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16. Comparing term by term:\n\nn\u00b2 term: matches.\n\n2a n^(3/2) must equal 2n^(3/2) \u2192 a = 1.\n\nNext term in expansion is (a\u00b2 + 2b) n. But the numerator doesn't have an n term; the next term after 2n^(3/2) is 8\u221an, which is n^(1/2). So that suggests that the coefficient of n must be zero.\n\nSo (a\u00b2 + 2b) n \u2192 since a=1, 1 + 2b =0 \u2192 2b = -1 \u2192 b= -0.5. But then, the next term in the expansion is 2ab\u221an. With a=1 and b=-0.5, 2ab= 2*(1)*(-0.5) = -1. So the term is -\u221an. But in the numerator, it's +8\u221an. That doesn't match. So this approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator isn't a perfect square, but maybe we can factor it differently. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression x can be simplified by substitution.\n\nWait, let me consider substituting t = \u221an. Then, t\u00b2 = n. Let's try that.\n\nSo t = \u221an \u2192 n = t\u00b2. Let's rewrite the expression in terms of t.\n\nNumerator becomes (t\u00b2)^2 + 2 t (t\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute each term:\n\nn\u00b2 = (t\u00b2)^2 = t^4.\n\n2\u221an(n +4) = 2t (t\u00b2 +4) = 2t\u00b3 + 8t.\n\nSo numerator is t^4 + 2t\u00b3 +8t +16.\n\nDenominator is n +4\u221an +4 = t\u00b2 +4t +4.\n\nHmm, denominator simplifies as t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2. That's a perfect square, which is good.\n\nSo now, x = [t^4 +2t\u00b3 +8t +16] / (t+2)^2.\n\nLet me see if the numerator can be factored or perhaps divided by (t+2)^2.\n\nWait, let's perform polynomial division. Divide numerator by (t+2)^2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator can be expressed as (t\u00b2 + a t + b)(t\u00b2 + c t + d). Let me try to factor the numerator.\n\nBut that might be a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can factor numerator in terms of (t+2).\n\nLet me try plugging t = -2 into the numerator to see if it's a root.\n\nNumerator at t=-2: (-2)^4 + 2*(-2)^3 +8*(-2) +16 = 16 + 2*(-8) + (-16) +16 = 16 -16 -16 +16 = 0. So t=-2 is a root. So (t + 2) is a factor.\n\nSo let's factor the numerator as (t+2)(something).\n\nUsing polynomial division, let's divide the numerator t^4 +2t\u00b3 +8t +16 by (t+2).\n\nSet up the division:\n\nDivide t^4 +2t\u00b3 +0t\u00b2 +8t +16 by (t + 2).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n- Coefficients: 1 (t^4), 2 (t^3), 0 (t^2), 8 (t), 16 (constant).\n\nRoot: t = -2.\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply by -2: 1*(-2) = -2. Add to next coefficient: 2 + (-2) =0.\n\nMultiply by -2: 0*(-2) =0. Add to next coefficient: 0 +0 =0.\n\nMultiply by -2: 0*(-2)=0. Add to next coefficient: 8 +0=8.\n\nMultiply by -2:8*(-2)=-16. Add to last coefficient:16 + (-16)=0. So no remainder.\n\nSo the numerator factors as (t +2)(t^3 +0 t^2 +0 t +8) = (t+2)(t^3 +8).\n\nWait, t^3 +8 is a sum of cubes. So t^3 +8 = (t + 2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4).\n\nSo putting it all together, the numerator is (t+2)(t+2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4) = (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4).\n\nSo numerator is (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4), denominator is (t+2)^2.\n\nSo x = [ (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4) ] / (t+2)^2 ) = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nAh! That's a huge simplification. So x = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nBut t =\u221an, so x = (\u221an)^2 - 2\u221an +4 = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, let me recheck that. Because t is sqrt(n), t squared is n. So yes, x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to finding the range of x when n is between 36 and 72.\n\nSo x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWe can write x = (n +4) - 2\u221an.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps we can write it as (\u221an -1)^2 +3. Let me check:\n\n(\u221an -1)^2 = n - 2\u221an +1. So x = (\u221an -1)^2 +3.\n\nWait, because x = n -2\u221an +4 = (n -2\u221an +1) +3 = (\u221an -1)^2 +3.\n\nYes, that's correct. So x = (\u221an -1)^2 +3.\n\nThis might be helpful because (\u221an -1)^2 is always non-negative, so x is at least 3. But since n is between 36 and72, \u221an is between 6 and about 8.485.\n\nSo let me find the minimum and maximum of x.\n\nLet me find x when n=36:\n\n\u221a36 =6.\n\nx = (6 -1)^2 +3 =5^2 +3=25 +3=28.\n\nWhen n=72:\n\n\u221a72 \u22488.485.\n\nx = (8.485 -1)^2 +3 \u2248 (7.485)^2 +3 \u2248 56 +3 =59.\n\nWait, wait, let me calculate 7.485 squared more accurately.\n\n7.485^2 = ?\n\nWell, 7^2 is 49, 7.5^2 is 56.25. 7.485 is just a bit less than 7.5, so let's compute:\n\n7.485 *7.485 = ?\n\n= (7.5 -0.015)^2 = 7.5^2 - 2*7.5*0.015 + (0.015)^2.\n\n=56.25 - 0.225 +0.000225.\n\n\u224856.25 -0.225 =56.025 +0.000225\u224856.025225.\n\nSo x \u224856.025 +3=59.025.\n\nSo when n=72, x\u224859.025.\n\nWait, but let me compute it more precisely. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute x at n=36 and n=72, and also check if x has any minima or maxima in between.\n\nWait, since x is a function of n, perhaps it's increasing or decreasing in this interval. Let's see.\n\nBut wait, since x = n - 2\u221an +4, let's compute its derivative with respect to n to see if it's increasing or decreasing.\n\ndx/dn = 1 - (2*(1/(2\u221an))) ) \u2192 1 - (1/\u221an).\n\nSo, when is this derivative positive or negative?\n\nWhen 1 - (1/\u221an) >0 \u2192 1>1/\u221an \u2192 \u221an>1 \u2192 n>1. Which is always true in our case since n starts at 36.\n\nSo the derivative is positive for all n \u22651, meaning x is an increasing function of n in the given interval.\n\nTherefore, the minimum x occurs at n=36, and maximum at n=72.\n\nSo x_min = 28, x_max\u224859.025.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 < x <54 \u2192 28 is above 20, and 59 is above 54 \u2192 so this option doesn't cover the maximum.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 28 is above 23, and 59 is above 58. So 59 is beyond 58, so x can be up to 59, so this option's upper limit is 58, which is less than 59. So B is not correct.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 28 is above 25, 59 is below 64. So all x would be within 28 to ~59, which is within 25 and 64. So C seems possible.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 x can be 28 (when n=36) and up to about 59, which is less than 60. So D says x is greater than 28 and less than 60. But wait, when n=36, x is exactly 28. So x can be equal to 28. But D says x>28, so at n=36, x=28, which is not included in D. So D's lower limit is not inclusive.\n\nBut wait, the question says 36 \u2264n \u226472. So n can be 36, so x can be 28. So option C includes x=28, because 25 <28 <64.\n\nOption D says x is greater than 28 and less than 60. So at n=36, x=28 is not included in D. So D isn't correct.\n\nOption C:25 <x <64. Since x starts at 28 and goes up to ~59, which is within 25 and 64. So C is correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: when n=36, x=28. 28 is greater than 25, so yes, within C's lower limit. And when n=72, x\u224859.025, which is less than 64. So yes, all x values are within 25 and 64.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again.\n\nOption C says 25 < x <64. So x can be as low as 28, which is above 25, and as high as ~59, which is below 64. So yes, all x satisfy 25 <x <64.\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but I should also check if the function x is continuous and doesn't have any other extrema in the interval. But earlier, we saw the derivative is always positive, so x is strictly increasing. So the minimum is 28, maximum about 59. So yes, all x are between 28 and 59. So the correct option is C:25 <x <64.\n\nWait, but option D is 28 <x <60. So from 28 to 60. But our x goes up to about 59, which is less than 60. So 28 is included as x=28 when n=36. But option D starts with x>28, so it excludes x=28. But since n can be 36, x can be exactly 28, so D isn't correct.\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this algebra problem here, and I need to figure out which option is correct for the given expression. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe question states: If n is such that 36 \u2264 n \u2264 72, then x equals (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16) divided by (n + 4\u221an + 4). We have to find which range x falls into.\n\nHmm. Alright, let's write down the expression again to get a clearer picture.\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16] / [n + 4\u221an +4]\n\nWait, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe it can be simplified. I notice that both the numerator and the denominator have terms involving n and \u221an. Perhaps there's a way to factor or rewrite this expression.\n\nLet me look at the numerator first. The numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Let me expand the 2\u221an(n +4) term. So that would be 2\u221an * n + 2\u221an *4 = 2n^(3/2) + 8\u221an.\n\nSo the numerator becomes: n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe it's a perfect square or can be expressed as a square of a binomial. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16. Let me try to group terms. Maybe group the first two and the last two terms.\n\nn\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) + (8\u221an +16). Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor as (n + a\u221an + b)\u00b2? Let me try expanding (n + a\u221an + b)\u00b2 and see if it matches the numerator.\n\nExpanding (n + a\u221an + b)^2: n\u00b2 + 2a n^(3/2) + (a\u00b2 + 2b) n + 2ab\u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nWait, but the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16. Comparing term by term:\n\nn\u00b2 term: matches.\n\n2a n^(3/2) must equal 2n^(3/2) \u2192 a = 1.\n\nNext term in expansion is (a\u00b2 + 2b) n. But the numerator doesn't have an n term; the next term after 2n^(3/2) is 8\u221an, which is n^(1/2). So that suggests that the coefficient of n must be zero.\n\nSo (a\u00b2 + 2b) n \u2192 since a=1, 1 + 2b =0 \u2192 2b = -1 \u2192 b= -0.5. But then, the next term in the expansion is 2ab\u221an. With a=1 and b=-0.5, 2ab= 2*(1)*(-0.5) = -1. So the term is -\u221an. But in the numerator, it's +8\u221an. That doesn't match. So this approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator isn't a perfect square, but maybe we can factor it differently. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression x can be simplified by substitution.\n\nWait, let me consider substituting t = \u221an. Then, t\u00b2 = n. Let's try that.\n\nSo t = \u221an \u2192 n = t\u00b2. Let's rewrite the expression in terms of t.\n\nNumerator becomes (t\u00b2)^2 + 2 t (t\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute each term:\n\nn\u00b2 = (t\u00b2)^2 = t^4.\n\n2\u221an(n +4) = 2t (t\u00b2 +4) = 2t\u00b3 + 8t.\n\nSo numerator is t^4 + 2t\u00b3 +8t +16.\n\nDenominator is n +4\u221an +4 = t\u00b2 +4t +4.\n\nHmm, denominator simplifies as t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2. That's a perfect square, which is good.\n\nSo now, x = [t^4 +2t\u00b3 +8t +16] / (t+2)^2.\n\nLet me see if the numerator can be factored or perhaps divided by (t+2)^2.\n\nWait, let's perform polynomial division. Divide numerator by (t+2)^2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator can be expressed as (t\u00b2 + a t + b)(t\u00b2 + c t + d). Let me try to factor the numerator.\n\nBut that might be a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can factor numerator in terms of (t+2).\n\nLet me try plugging t = -2 into the numerator to see if it's a root.\n\nNumerator at t=-2: (-2)^4 + 2*(-2)^3 +8*(-2) +16 = 16 + 2*(-8) + (-16) +16 = 16 -16 -16 +16 = 0. So t=-2 is a root. So (t + 2) is a factor.\n\nSo let's factor the numerator as (t+2)(something).\n\nUsing polynomial division, let's divide the numerator t^4 +2t\u00b3 +8t +16 by (t+2).\n\nSet up the division:\n\nDivide t^4 +2t\u00b3 +0t\u00b2 +8t +16 by (t + 2).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n- Coefficients: 1 (t^4), 2 (t^3), 0 (t^2), 8 (t), 16 (constant).\n\nRoot: t = -2.\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply by -2: 1*(-2) = -2. Add to next coefficient: 2 + (-2) =0.\n\nMultiply by -2: 0*(-2) =0. Add to next coefficient: 0 +0 =0.\n\nMultiply by -2: 0*(-2)=0. Add to next coefficient: 8 +0=8.\n\nMultiply by -2:8*(-2)=-16. Add to last coefficient:16 + (-16)=0. So no remainder.\n\nSo the numerator factors as (t +2)(t^3 +0 t^2 +0 t +8) = (t+2)(t^3 +8).\n\nWait, t^3 +8 is a sum of cubes. So t^3 +8 = (t + 2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4).\n\nSo putting it all together, the numerator is (t+2)(t+2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4) = (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4).\n\nSo numerator is (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4), denominator is (t+2)^2.\n\nSo x = [ (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4) ] / (t+2)^2 ) = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nAh! That's a huge simplification. So x = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nBut t =\u221an, so x = (\u221an)^2 - 2\u221an +4 = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, let me recheck that. Because t is sqrt(n), t squared is n. So yes, x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to finding the range of x when n is between 36 and 72.\n\nSo x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWe can write x = (n +4) - 2\u221an.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps we can write it as (\u221an -1)^2 +3. Let me check:\n\n(\u221an -1)^2 = n - 2\u221an +1. So x = (\u221an -1)^2 +3.\n\nWait, because x = n -2\u221an +4 = (n -2\u221an +1) +3 = (\u221an -1)^2 +3.\n\nYes, that's correct. So x = (\u221an -1)^2 +3.\n\nThis might be helpful because (\u221an -1)^2 is always non-negative, so x is at least 3. But since n is between 36 and72, \u221an is between 6 and about 8.485.\n\nSo let me find the minimum and maximum of x.\n\nLet me find x when n=36:\n\n\u221a36 =6.\n\nx = (6 -1)^2 +3 =5^2 +3=25 +3=28.\n\nWhen n=72:\n\n\u221a72 \u22488.485.\n\nx = (8.485 -1)^2 +3 \u2248 (7.485)^2 +3 \u2248 56 +3 =59.\n\nWait, wait, let me calculate 7.485 squared more accurately.\n\n7.485^2 = ?\n\nWell, 7^2 is 49, 7.5^2 is 56.25. 7.485 is just a bit less than 7.5, so let's compute:\n\n7.485 *7.485 = ?\n\n= (7.5 -0.015)^2 = 7.5^2 - 2*7.5*0.015 + (0.015)^2.\n\n=56.25 - 0.225 +0.000225.\n\n\u224856.25 -0.225 =56.025 +0.000225\u224856.025225.\n\nSo x \u224856.025 +3=59.025.\n\nSo when n=72, x\u224859.025.\n\nWait, but let me compute it more precisely. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute x at n=36 and n=72, and also check if x has any minima or maxima in between.\n\nWait, since x is a function of n, perhaps it's increasing or decreasing in this interval. Let's see.\n\nBut wait, since x = n - 2\u221an +4, let's compute its derivative with respect to n to see if it's increasing or decreasing.\n\ndx/dn = 1 - (2*(1/(2\u221an))) ) \u2192 1 - (1/\u221an).\n\nSo, when is this derivative positive or negative?\n\nWhen 1 - (1/\u221an) >0 \u2192 1>1/\u221an \u2192 \u221an>1 \u2192 n>1. Which is always true in our case since n starts at 36.\n\nSo the derivative is positive for all n \u22651, meaning x is an increasing function of n in the given interval.\n\nTherefore, the minimum x occurs at n=36, and maximum at n=72.\n\nSo x_min = 28, x_max\u224859.025.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 < x <54 \u2192 28 is above 20, and 59 is above 54 \u2192 so this option doesn't cover the maximum.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 28 is above 23, and 59 is above 58. So 59 is beyond 58, so x can be up to 59, so this option's upper limit is 58, which is less than 59. So B is not correct.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 28 is above 25, 59 is below 64. So all x would be within 28 to ~59, which is within 25 and 64. So C seems possible.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 x can be 28 (when n=36) and up to about 59, which is less than 60. So D says x is greater than 28 and less than 60. But wait, when n=36, x is exactly 28. So x can be equal to 28. But D says x>28, so at n=36, x=28, which is not included in D. So D's lower limit is not inclusive.\n\nBut wait, the question says 36 \u2264n \u226472. So n can be 36, so x can be 28. So option C includes x=28, because 25 <28 <64.\n\nOption D says x is greater than 28 and less than 60. So at n=36, x=28 is not included in D. So D isn't correct.\n\nOption C:25 <x <64. Since x starts at 28 and goes up to ~59, which is within 25 and 64. So C is correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: when n=36, x=28. 28 is greater than 25, so yes, within C's lower limit. And when n=72, x\u224859.025, which is less than 64. So yes, all x values are within 25 and 64.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again.\n\nOption C says 25 < x <64. So x can be as low as 28, which is above 25, and as high as ~59, which is below 64. So yes, all x satisfy 25 <x <64.\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but I should also check if the function x is continuous and doesn't have any other extrema in the interval. But earlier, we saw the derivative is always positive, so x is strictly increasing. So the minimum is 28, maximum about 59. So yes, all x are between 28 and 59. So the correct option is C:25 <x <64.\n\nWait, but option D is 28 <x <60. So from 28 to 60. But our x goes up to about 59, which is less than 60. So 28 is included as x=28 when n=36. But option D starts with x>28, so it excludes x=28. But since n can be 36, x can be exactly 28, so D isn't correct.\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the given expression for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4}.\n\\]\n\n### Simplification of the Expression\n1. **Substitution**: Let \\( t = \\sqrt{n} \\), so \\( n = t^2 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the range of x based on the given equation and the range of n. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nThe problem says that n is between 36 and 72, inclusive. So n can be any integer or maybe any real number in that interval? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but since it's a multiple-choice question, maybe it doesn't matter much. \n\nThe equation given is x = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16] divided by [n + 4\u221an +4]. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it somehow. Let me write it down again:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nWait a minute, the numerator and the denominator look similar. Maybe there's a way to factor or simplify them. Let's try to see if the numerator is a perfect square or something. \n\nLet me consider the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Hmm. Let's expand that 2\u221an(n +4) term. That would be 2\u221an * n + 2\u221an *4 = 2n^(3/2) + 8\u221an. So the numerator becomes n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of the numerator as something squared. Like, perhaps (a + b)^2, where a and b are terms involving \u221an. Let me try that.\n\nSuppose the numerator is (something)^2. Let me see: n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) + ... Let me see, maybe (n + something)^2. Let's try expanding (n + c\u221an + d)^2 and see if it matches.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (n + something)^2. Let's try (n + something)^2 and see if it fits.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me factor out terms in the numerator and denominator. Alternatively, perhaps substitution will help. Let me let t = \u221an. Since n is between 36 and 72, t will be between 6 and about 8.485 (since sqrt(72) is around 8.485). So t is in [6, approx 8.485].\n\nSo, substituting t = \u221an, which means n = t\u00b2.\n\nSo let's rewrite the numerator and denominator in terms of t.\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16 = (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t (t\u00b2 +4) +16 = t^4 + 2t^3 + 8t +16.\n\nDenominator: n +4\u221an +4 = t\u00b2 +4t +4.\n\nWait, the denominator is t\u00b2 +4t +4. That's a perfect square. t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2.\n\nSo denominator is (t+2)^2.\n\nNow, numerator: t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16. Hmm. Let me see if I can factor that.\n\nLooking for factors, perhaps group terms. Let's group t^4 + 2t^3 and 8t +16.\n\nt^4 + 2t^3 = t^3(t + 2)\n8t +16 = 8(t + 2)\nSo numerator becomes t^3(t+2) + 8(t+2) = (t+2)(t^3 +8)\n\nHmm, t^3 +8 is a sum of cubes. It factors into (t +2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4). So numerator is (t+2)(t+2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4) = (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4)\n\nSo now, x is numerator over denominator, which is [ (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4) ] / [ (t+2)^2 ]\n\nThe (t+2)^2 terms cancel out, so x = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nOh, that's much simpler! So x = t\u00b2 - 2t +4, where t = sqrt(n). And t is between 6 and approximately 8.485.\n\nNow, I need to find the range of x as t varies from 6 to about 8.485. Let's see.\n\nSo x is a quadratic in t. Let me write x(t) = t\u00b2 - 2t +4.\n\nThis is a parabola opening upwards, with vertex at t = -b/(2a) = 2/(2*1) = 1. So the minimum of x(t) is at t=1, which is x(1)=1 -2 +4=3. But our t is between 6 and 8.485, so we're looking at the function's behavior in that interval.\n\nSince the parabola opens upwards, and the vertex is at t=1, which is far to the left of our interval, the function will be increasing on t >=1. So in our case, t starts at 6, so x increases as t increases.\n\nWait, let me double-check: the derivative of x with respect to t is 2t -2. At t=6, the derivative is 12-2=10, positive. So the function is increasing for t>1, which includes our entire interval. So as t increases from 6 to ~8.485, x increases.\n\nSo the minimum x is at t=6, and maximum at t=8.485.\n\nLet's compute x at t=6.\n\nx(6) = 6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nAt t=8.485, let's compute x. But wait, 8.485 is sqrt(72) because 8^2 is 64, 8.5^2 is 72.25, so sqrt(72) is about 8.485.\n\nx(8.485) = (8.485)^2 - 2*(8.485) +4.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n(8.485)^2 = 72 (since t^2 is n, which is 72 in this case).\n\nSo 72 - 2*(8.485) +4.\n\n2*(8.485)=16.97.\n\nSo 72 +4=76. 76 -16.97=59.03.\n\nSo x at t=8.485 is approximately 59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 (when n=36, t=6) to about 59.03 (when n=72, t=8.485).\n\nWait, but let me check the endpoints again. Because when n=36, t=6, x=6^2 -2*6 +4=36-12+4=28.\n\nWhen n=72, t=sqrt(72)= about 8.485, so x= (8.485)^2 - 2*8.485 +4. As I calculated earlier, that's 72 -16.97 +4= 59.03.\n\nWait, but the options given are:\n\nA)20 < x <54\n\nB)23 <x <58\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nE)None of these\n\nSo our calculated range is x is between 28 and approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. So that would include all x from 28 to about 59, as 59.03 is just under 60.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the substitution or the calculation.\n\nWait, I should double-check the substitution steps.\n\nOriginal equation: x = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n+4) +16]/[n +4\u221an +4].\n\nSubstituted t=\u221an, so n = t\u00b2.\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 is (t\u00b2)^2 = t^4.\n\n2\u221an (n+4) = 2t (t\u00b2 +4) = 2t^3 + 8t.\n\nAdding 16: numerator is t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nDenominator: n +4\u221an +4 = t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2.\n\nFactoring numerator: t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Let me try to factor this as (t^2 + a t + b)(t^2 + c t + d).\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to factor as (t^2 + a t + b)^2, but that might not fit.\n\nWait, earlier I found that numerator is (t+2)^2 (t^2 - 2t +4). Let me check that.\n\n(t+2)^2 = t^2 +4t +4.\n\nMultiply by (t^2 - 2t +4):\n\n(t^2 +4t +4)(t^2 -2t +4) = t^4 -2t^3 +4t^2 +4t^3 -8t^2 +16t +4t^2 -8t +16.\n\nCombining like terms:\n\nt^4 + ( -2t^3 +4t^3 ) + (4t^2 -8t^2 +4t^2 ) + (16t -8t) +16.\n\nWhich is t^4 +2t^3 +0t^2 +8t +16. Wait, but the numerator we have is t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. So that's correct. So the numerator factors correctly.\n\nSo x becomes (t+2)^2 (t^2 - 2t +4) / (t+2)^2 = t^2 - 2t +4.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo x = t\u00b2 -2t +4, which is a quadratic function with vertex at t=1, as before. Since our t starts at 6 and goes up to about 8.485, the function is increasing throughout this interval.\n\nSo the minimum x is at t=6: 6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 = 36-12+4=28.\n\nThe maximum x is at t=8.485: 8.485\u00b2 is 72, 72 - 2*8.485 +4 =72-16.97+4= 59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. So our calculated maximum is about 59.03, which is less than 60, so the upper bound of the option is 60, which would include all x up to 59.03.\n\nSo the correct range is x between 28 and approximately 59.03, which is within 28 <x <60.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check if x can reach exactly 28 or 60.\n\nAt n=36, t=6, x=28. So x=28 is included. So the lower bound is 28, not greater than.\n\nBut looking at the options, option D says 28 < x <60. Hmm, but our x is 28 when n=36, which is included in the given range 36 \u2264n\u226472. So x can be exactly 28. So the lower bound is not strictly greater than 28, but equal to 28. Similarly, at n=72, x is about 59.03, which is less than 60.\n\nSo the correct range is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03. So the options are given as open intervals. So which option includes all possible x?\n\nOption D is 28 <x <60. But wait, x can be equal to 28 when n=36, which is within the given n range. So if the option is 28 <x <60, then x=28 would not be included, but according to our calculation, x can be 28. So the correct interval should be 28 \u2264x \u226459.03. So the options don't include 28 as a lower bound; option D is 28 <x <60, which would exclude x=28. So perhaps the correct answer is E) None of these.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The question says \"satisfies\", so perhaps the inequalities are strict. Or maybe the options are using open intervals because the endpoints are achieved at n=36 and n=72, which are included in the given range.\n\nWait, no, because n can be 36 or 72. So x can be exactly 28 or about 59.03.\n\nSo the options are:\n\nA)20 < x <54 \u2192 28 is higher than 20, but 59 is higher than 54. So no.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 59 is higher than 58, so no.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 28 is higher than 25, 59 is lower than 64. So possible, but our maximum is about 59.03, which is less than 60, so 59.03 is less than 64.\n\nWait, but option C is 25 <x <64. Our x starts at 28, so all x in 28 to 59.03 are included in 25 to 64. But the lower bound in our case is 28, which is higher than 25, so option C's lower bound is 25, which is lower than our x's minimum. So any x in our range is within option C's range. But the question is, which option correctly describes the x's range?\n\nWait, but the options are for the range that x satisfies. So if x is between 28 and about 59, which is within 25 and 64, but the actual lower and upper bounds are higher and lower, respectively. So the correct option should be D, which is 28 <x <60, but wait, our x can be exactly 28. So the correct interval would be 28 \u2264x <60, but none of the options have this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are using open intervals because the endpoints might not be achievable, but in this case, the endpoints are achievable because n=36 and n=72 are included.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-calculate x when n=36 and n=72.\n\nn=36: t=6.\n\nx = 6^2 -2*6 +4 =36-12+4=28.\n\nn=72: t= sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485.\n\nx = (8.485)^2 -2*(8.485) +4.\n\nBut 8.485^2 is exactly 72. So x=72 - 2*(8.485) +4.\n\nCompute 2*8.485=16.97.\n\n72 +4=76.\n\n76-16.97=59.03.\n\nSo x is exactly 28 when n=36 and approximately 59.03 when n=72.\n\nSo x can reach 28 and up to about 59.03. So the interval is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 20 <x <54 \u2192 No, because x can go up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 No, because x can be up to ~59, which is more than 58.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 25 is less than 28, so some x in our range are above 25, but 64 is higher than 59.03, so x would be within this range. But wait, the actual range is higher than 28, which is included in 25 <x, but the maximum is lower than 64. So this option is correct for the upper limit but not the lower. Wait, but the actual x starts at 28, which is higher than 25, so all x would satisfy 25 <x. But the upper limit is 59, which is less than 64, so all x would also satisfy x<64. So option C would include all x values. But wait, the correct x range is 28 to 59. So the option C is 25 <x <64. So 28 is within that, and 59 is within that. So option C includes the x values, but the correct answer is that x is between 28 and ~59. So the correct answer would be the option that says 28 <x <60, which is option D. But option D says 28 <x <60, which doesn't include x=28, but x can be 28. So perhaps none of the options are correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should re-examine the options. Let me read the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)20 < x <54 \u2192 No.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 No.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 Yes, because 28 is >25, and 59 is <64. So all x's are within this range. So why is option D present?\n\nWait, the problem is to find which option x satisfies. So if the actual x is between 28 and 59, then option C (25 <x <64) includes all x's, but it's a larger range. Option D is 28 <x <60, which is a tighter range. But since x can be exactly 28, which is not included in option D (which is open interval), so option D's lower bound is not correct. So the correct range is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03, which is not exactly any of the options.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D is 28 <x <60. So 28 is not included. But our x can be 28, so the correct interval should include 28, so option D is not correct.\n\nSo then, looking at the options, the only option that correctly includes all possible x values is option C, but that's a larger range. Alternatively, perhaps none of the options are correct, so the answer is E.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOur x is between 28 and approximately 59.03.\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, because 28 is >25 and 59.03 <64.\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 but x can be 28, so this option excludes the lower bound.\n\nSo the correct interval is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03, which is not exactly covered by any of the options. The closest is option D, but it's open on 28 and 60. So the correct answer would be E) None of these.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute x at n=36 and n=72.\n\nn=36: t=6.\n\nx = t\u00b2 -2t +4 =36 -12 +4=28. Correct.\n\nn=72: t=sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)=approx 8.485.\n\nx= t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nt\u00b2=72.\n\n2t=2*8.485=16.97.\n\nSo x=72 -16.97 +4=76-16.97=59.03. Correct.\n\nSo the x ranges from 28 to 59.03.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. So the lower bound is 28, but since x can be exactly 28, the correct interval should include 28. So option D is incorrect because it's an open interval, not including 28.\n\nOption C is 25 <x <64. So 25 is less than 28, and 64 is more than 59.03. So the x values are within this range. But the correct x starts at 28, which is higher than 25, so the correct range is a subset of option C's range. But the question is to select the option that x satisfies, which would mean the correct answer is the option that correctly bounds x. Since option D is a tighter range, but it's not correct because it doesn't include x=28.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the maximum and minimum to fit within the option, even if the option's bounds are wider. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but the question is: \"x satisfies\" the given options. So which option correctly describes the range of x.\n\nOur x is between 28 and about 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 No, because x can be up to 59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 No, because x can be up to 59.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 Yes, because 28 is >25, and 59 is <64.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 But x can be exactly 28, so option D's lower bound is not correct.\n\nE)None of these.\n\nSo if the correct x range is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03, and none of the options include this exactly, then the answer would be E.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should re-express the x function. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution or factoring.\n\nWait, let me re-express the numerator and denominator again.\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nDenominator: n +4\u221an +4.\n\nWe substituted t=\u221an, so n=t\u00b2.\n\nNumerator becomes t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nDenominator becomes t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2.\n\nThen, factoring numerator as (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 - 2t +4).\n\nSo x = [ (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4) ] / (t+2)^2 = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo x = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo x is 28 at t=6 and about 59.03 at t=8.485.\n\nSo the correct range is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03.\n\nLooking at the options, none of them exactly match this. Option D is 28 <x <60, which is close but doesn't include x=28. So the correct answer would be E) None of these.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistake in the substitution. Let me try plugging in another value, say n=49, t=7.\n\nx =7\u00b2 -2*7 +4=49-14+4=39.\n\nWhich is within the range 28 to 59. So for n=49, x=39, which is within option D's range (28 <x <60) and also within option C's range (25 <x <64).\n\nSo if the correct range is from 28 to about 59, then the options that include this entire range are C and D. But the question is to choose the option that x satisfies. So the correct x is in 28 to ~59.\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. So x can be 28, which is not included in D's lower bound. So the correct answer is E) None of these.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the range of x based on the given equation and the range of n. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nThe problem says that n is between 36 and 72, inclusive. So n can be any integer or maybe any real number in that interval? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but since it's a multiple-choice question, maybe it doesn't matter much. \n\nThe equation given is x = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16] divided by [n + 4\u221an +4]. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it somehow. Let me write it down again:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nWait a minute, the numerator and the denominator look similar. Maybe there's a way to factor or simplify them. Let's try to see if the numerator is a perfect square or something. \n\nLet me consider the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Hmm. Let's expand that 2\u221an(n +4) term. That would be 2\u221an * n + 2\u221an *4 = 2n^(3/2) + 8\u221an. So the numerator becomes n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of the numerator as something squared. Like, perhaps (a + b)^2, where a and b are terms involving \u221an. Let me try that.\n\nSuppose the numerator is (something)^2. Let me see: n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) + ... Let me see, maybe (n + something)^2. Let's try expanding (n + c\u221an + d)^2 and see if it matches.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (n + something)^2. Let's try (n + something)^2 and see if it fits.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me factor out terms in the numerator and denominator. Alternatively, perhaps substitution will help. Let me let t = \u221an. Since n is between 36 and 72, t will be between 6 and about 8.485 (since sqrt(72) is around 8.485). So t is in [6, approx 8.485].\n\nSo, substituting t = \u221an, which means n = t\u00b2.\n\nSo let's rewrite the numerator and denominator in terms of t.\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16 = (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t (t\u00b2 +4) +16 = t^4 + 2t^3 + 8t +16.\n\nDenominator: n +4\u221an +4 = t\u00b2 +4t +4.\n\nWait, the denominator is t\u00b2 +4t +4. That's a perfect square. t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2.\n\nSo denominator is (t+2)^2.\n\nNow, numerator: t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16. Hmm. Let me see if I can factor that.\n\nLooking for factors, perhaps group terms. Let's group t^4 + 2t^3 and 8t +16.\n\nt^4 + 2t^3 = t^3(t + 2)\n8t +16 = 8(t + 2)\nSo numerator becomes t^3(t+2) + 8(t+2) = (t+2)(t^3 +8)\n\nHmm, t^3 +8 is a sum of cubes. It factors into (t +2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4). So numerator is (t+2)(t+2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4) = (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4)\n\nSo now, x is numerator over denominator, which is [ (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4) ] / [ (t+2)^2 ]\n\nThe (t+2)^2 terms cancel out, so x = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nOh, that's much simpler! So x = t\u00b2 - 2t +4, where t = sqrt(n). And t is between 6 and approximately 8.485.\n\nNow, I need to find the range of x as t varies from 6 to about 8.485. Let's see.\n\nSo x is a quadratic in t. Let me write x(t) = t\u00b2 - 2t +4.\n\nThis is a parabola opening upwards, with vertex at t = -b/(2a) = 2/(2*1) = 1. So the minimum of x(t) is at t=1, which is x(1)=1 -2 +4=3. But our t is between 6 and 8.485, so we're looking at the function's behavior in that interval.\n\nSince the parabola opens upwards, and the vertex is at t=1, which is far to the left of our interval, the function will be increasing on t >=1. So in our case, t starts at 6, so x increases as t increases.\n\nWait, let me double-check: the derivative of x with respect to t is 2t -2. At t=6, the derivative is 12-2=10, positive. So the function is increasing for t>1, which includes our entire interval. So as t increases from 6 to ~8.485, x increases.\n\nSo the minimum x is at t=6, and maximum at t=8.485.\n\nLet's compute x at t=6.\n\nx(6) = 6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nAt t=8.485, let's compute x. But wait, 8.485 is sqrt(72) because 8^2 is 64, 8.5^2 is 72.25, so sqrt(72) is about 8.485.\n\nx(8.485) = (8.485)^2 - 2*(8.485) +4.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n(8.485)^2 = 72 (since t^2 is n, which is 72 in this case).\n\nSo 72 - 2*(8.485) +4.\n\n2*(8.485)=16.97.\n\nSo 72 +4=76. 76 -16.97=59.03.\n\nSo x at t=8.485 is approximately 59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 (when n=36, t=6) to about 59.03 (when n=72, t=8.485).\n\nWait, but let me check the endpoints again. Because when n=36, t=6, x=6^2 -2*6 +4=36-12+4=28.\n\nWhen n=72, t=sqrt(72)= about 8.485, so x= (8.485)^2 - 2*8.485 +4. As I calculated earlier, that's 72 -16.97 +4= 59.03.\n\nWait, but the options given are:\n\nA)20 < x <54\n\nB)23 <x <58\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nE)None of these\n\nSo our calculated range is x is between 28 and approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. So that would include all x from 28 to about 59, as 59.03 is just under 60.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the substitution or the calculation.\n\nWait, I should double-check the substitution steps.\n\nOriginal equation: x = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n+4) +16]/[n +4\u221an +4].\n\nSubstituted t=\u221an, so n = t\u00b2.\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 is (t\u00b2)^2 = t^4.\n\n2\u221an (n+4) = 2t (t\u00b2 +4) = 2t^3 + 8t.\n\nAdding 16: numerator is t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nDenominator: n +4\u221an +4 = t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2.\n\nFactoring numerator: t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Let me try to factor this as (t^2 + a t + b)(t^2 + c t + d).\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to factor as (t^2 + a t + b)^2, but that might not fit.\n\nWait, earlier I found that numerator is (t+2)^2 (t^2 - 2t +4). Let me check that.\n\n(t+2)^2 = t^2 +4t +4.\n\nMultiply by (t^2 - 2t +4):\n\n(t^2 +4t +4)(t^2 -2t +4) = t^4 -2t^3 +4t^2 +4t^3 -8t^2 +16t +4t^2 -8t +16.\n\nCombining like terms:\n\nt^4 + ( -2t^3 +4t^3 ) + (4t^2 -8t^2 +4t^2 ) + (16t -8t) +16.\n\nWhich is t^4 +2t^3 +0t^2 +8t +16. Wait, but the numerator we have is t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. So that's correct. So the numerator factors correctly.\n\nSo x becomes (t+2)^2 (t^2 - 2t +4) / (t+2)^2 = t^2 - 2t +4.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo x = t\u00b2 -2t +4, which is a quadratic function with vertex at t=1, as before. Since our t starts at 6 and goes up to about 8.485, the function is increasing throughout this interval.\n\nSo the minimum x is at t=6: 6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 = 36-12+4=28.\n\nThe maximum x is at t=8.485: 8.485\u00b2 is 72, 72 - 2*8.485 +4 =72-16.97+4= 59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. So our calculated maximum is about 59.03, which is less than 60, so the upper bound of the option is 60, which would include all x up to 59.03.\n\nSo the correct range is x between 28 and approximately 59.03, which is within 28 <x <60.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check if x can reach exactly 28 or 60.\n\nAt n=36, t=6, x=28. So x=28 is included. So the lower bound is 28, not greater than.\n\nBut looking at the options, option D says 28 < x <60. Hmm, but our x is 28 when n=36, which is included in the given range 36 \u2264n\u226472. So x can be exactly 28. So the lower bound is not strictly greater than 28, but equal to 28. Similarly, at n=72, x is about 59.03, which is less than 60.\n\nSo the correct range is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03. So the options are given as open intervals. So which option includes all possible x?\n\nOption D is 28 <x <60. But wait, x can be equal to 28 when n=36, which is within the given n range. So if the option is 28 <x <60, then x=28 would not be included, but according to our calculation, x can be 28. So the correct interval should be 28 \u2264x \u226459.03. So the options don't include 28 as a lower bound; option D is 28 <x <60, which would exclude x=28. So perhaps the correct answer is E) None of these.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The question says \"satisfies\", so perhaps the inequalities are strict. Or maybe the options are using open intervals because the endpoints are achieved at n=36 and n=72, which are included in the given range.\n\nWait, no, because n can be 36 or 72. So x can be exactly 28 or about 59.03.\n\nSo the options are:\n\nA)20 < x <54 \u2192 28 is higher than 20, but 59 is higher than 54. So no.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 59 is higher than 58, so no.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 28 is higher than 25, 59 is lower than 64. So possible, but our maximum is about 59.03, which is less than 60, so 59.03 is less than 64.\n\nWait, but option C is 25 <x <64. Our x starts at 28, so all x in 28 to 59.03 are included in 25 to 64. But the lower bound in our case is 28, which is higher than 25, so option C's lower bound is 25, which is lower than our x's minimum. So any x in our range is within option C's range. But the question is, which option correctly describes the x's range?\n\nWait, but the options are for the range that x satisfies. So if x is between 28 and about 59, which is within 25 and 64, but the actual lower and upper bounds are higher and lower, respectively. So the correct option should be D, which is 28 <x <60, but wait, our x can be exactly 28. So the correct interval would be 28 \u2264x <60, but none of the options have this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are using open intervals because the endpoints might not be achievable, but in this case, the endpoints are achievable because n=36 and n=72 are included.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-calculate x when n=36 and n=72.\n\nn=36: t=6.\n\nx = 6^2 -2*6 +4 =36-12+4=28.\n\nn=72: t= sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485.\n\nx = (8.485)^2 -2*(8.485) +4.\n\nBut 8.485^2 is exactly 72. So x=72 - 2*(8.485) +4.\n\nCompute 2*8.485=16.97.\n\n72 +4=76.\n\n76-16.97=59.03.\n\nSo x is exactly 28 when n=36 and approximately 59.03 when n=72.\n\nSo x can reach 28 and up to about 59.03. So the interval is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 20 <x <54 \u2192 No, because x can go up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 No, because x can be up to ~59, which is more than 58.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 25 is less than 28, so some x in our range are above 25, but 64 is higher than 59.03, so x would be within this range. But wait, the actual range is higher than 28, which is included in 25 <x, but the maximum is lower than 64. So this option is correct for the upper limit but not the lower. Wait, but the actual x starts at 28, which is higher than 25, so all x would satisfy 25 <x. But the upper limit is 59, which is less than 64, so all x would also satisfy x<64. So option C would include all x values. But wait, the correct x range is 28 to 59. So the option C is 25 <x <64. So 28 is within that, and 59 is within that. So option C includes the x values, but the correct answer is that x is between 28 and ~59. So the correct answer would be the option that says 28 <x <60, which is option D. But option D says 28 <x <60, which doesn't include x=28, but x can be 28. So perhaps none of the options are correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should re-examine the options. Let me read the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)20 < x <54 \u2192 No.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 No.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 Yes, because 28 is >25, and 59 is <64. So all x's are within this range. So why is option D present?\n\nWait, the problem is to find which option x satisfies. So if the actual x is between 28 and 59, then option C (25 <x <64) includes all x's, but it's a larger range. Option D is 28 <x <60, which is a tighter range. But since x can be exactly 28, which is not included in option D (which is open interval), so option D's lower bound is not correct. So the correct range is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03, which is not exactly any of the options.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D is 28 <x <60. So 28 is not included. But our x can be 28, so the correct interval should include 28, so option D is not correct.\n\nSo then, looking at the options, the only option that correctly includes all possible x values is option C, but that's a larger range. Alternatively, perhaps none of the options are correct, so the answer is E.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOur x is between 28 and approximately 59.03.\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, because 28 is >25 and 59.03 <64.\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 but x can be 28, so this option excludes the lower bound.\n\nSo the correct interval is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03, which is not exactly covered by any of the options. The closest is option D, but it's open on 28 and 60. So the correct answer would be E) None of these.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute x at n=36 and n=72.\n\nn=36: t=6.\n\nx = t\u00b2 -2t +4 =36 -12 +4=28. Correct.\n\nn=72: t=sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)=approx 8.485.\n\nx= t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nt\u00b2=72.\n\n2t=2*8.485=16.97.\n\nSo x=72 -16.97 +4=76-16.97=59.03. Correct.\n\nSo the x ranges from 28 to 59.03.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. So the lower bound is 28, but since x can be exactly 28, the correct interval should include 28. So option D is incorrect because it's an open interval, not including 28.\n\nOption C is 25 <x <64. So 25 is less than 28, and 64 is more than 59.03. So the x values are within this range. But the correct x starts at 28, which is higher than 25, so the correct range is a subset of option C's range. But the question is to select the option that x satisfies, which would mean the correct answer is the option that correctly bounds x. Since option D is a tighter range, but it's not correct because it doesn't include x=28.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the maximum and minimum to fit within the option, even if the option's bounds are wider. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but the question is: \"x satisfies\" the given options. So which option correctly describes the range of x.\n\nOur x is between 28 and about 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 No, because x can be up to 59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 No, because x can be up to 59.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 Yes, because 28 is >25, and 59 is <64.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 But x can be exactly 28, so option D's lower bound is not correct.\n\nE)None of these.\n\nSo if the correct x range is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03, and none of the options include this exactly, then the answer would be E.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should re-express the x function. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution or factoring.\n\nWait, let me re-express the numerator and denominator again.\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nDenominator: n +4\u221an +4.\n\nWe substituted t=\u221an, so n=t\u00b2.\n\nNumerator becomes t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nDenominator becomes t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2.\n\nThen, factoring numerator as (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 - 2t +4).\n\nSo x = [ (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4) ] / (t+2)^2 = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo x = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo x is 28 at t=6 and about 59.03 at t=8.485.\n\nSo the correct range is 28 \u2264x \u226459.03.\n\nLooking at the options, none of them exactly match this. Option D is 28 <x <60, which is close but doesn't include x=28. So the correct answer would be E) None of these.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistake in the substitution. Let me try plugging in another value, say n=49, t=7.\n\nx =7\u00b2 -2*7 +4=49-14+4=39.\n\nWhich is within the range 28 to 59. So for n=49, x=39, which is within option D's range (28 <x <60) and also within option C's range (25 <x <64).\n\nSo if the correct range is from 28 to about 59, then the options that include this entire range are C and D. But the question is to choose the option that x satisfies. So the correct x is in 28 to ~59.\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. So x can be 28, which is not included in D's lower bound. So the correct answer is E) None of these.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the range of \\( x \\) for the equation:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is in the range \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the solution. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: If n is such that 36 \u2264 n \u2264 72, then x = (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16) divided by (n + 4\u221an + 4) satisfies one of the given options. The options are A to E, with different ranges for x.\n\nHmm, the expression for x looks a bit complicated. I think I should try simplifying it first. Let me write it down:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16] / [n + 4\u221an + 4]\n\nWait, maybe I can factor the numerator and denominator. Let's see. The numerator is n squared plus something. Oh, wait, maybe the numerator is a perfect square. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16. Hmm, that looks like it could be (something)^2. Let me think: If I have (a + b)^2, that's a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. So let's see if I can write the numerator as a square.\n\nLet me set a = n, and then see what b would be. Because the middle term is 2\u221an(n+4), which is 2ab. So 2ab = 2\u221an(n+4). So ab = \u221an(n+4). Since a is n, then b would be \u221a(n+4). Because n * \u221a(n+4) = \u221an * \u221a(n+4) * n? Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator is [\u221an + something]^2. Let's try that. Let me assume the numerator is (\u221an + c)^2, where c is some expression. Expanding that, it would be n + 2c\u221an + c\u00b2. Wait, but the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Hmm, that doesn't look right. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because (\u221an)^2 is n, but in the numerator, it's n squared. So maybe the numerator is (n + something)^2. Let me check that.\n\nWait, if I let the numerator be (n + a\u221an + b)^2, maybe that could work. Let me expand that:\n\n(n + a\u221an + b)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2a n\u221an + 2bn + a\u00b2 n + 2ab\u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nWait, that's getting a bit complicated. Let me see if I can match the terms to the numerator. The numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. So when expanded, that's n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an +16. Let me compare that to the expansion of (n + a\u221an + b)^2.\n\nWait, but maybe I should try a different approach. Let me consider the numerator as n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) + 16. Let me see: 2\u221an(n+4) can be written as 2n\u221an + 8\u221an. So the numerator becomes n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an +16.\n\nNow, looking at the denominator: n +4\u221an +4. Hmm, that seems like it could be (\u221an +2)^2. Let me check: (\u221an +2)^2 = n +4\u221an +4. Oh yeah, exactly. So denominator is (\u221an +2)^2.\n\nSo the denominator simplifies to (\u221an +2)^2. That's helpful.\n\nNow, back to the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an +8\u221an +16. Let me see if this can be written as (n + something)^2 plus something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's (n + 2\u221an + 4)^2? Let's compute that:\n\n(n + 2\u221an +4)^2 = n\u00b2 + (2\u221an)*n*2 + ... Wait, let's do it step by step.\n\n(n + 2\u221an +4)^2 = n\u00b2 + (2\u221an)(n) + (4)^2 + 2*(n)*(2\u221an) + 2*(n)*4 + 2*(2\u221an)*4.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me think of it as (a + b + c)^2, but that's a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe it's (n + something + something else)^2. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as (n + 2\u221an +4)^2. Let me expand that:\n\n(n + 2\u221an +4)^2 = n^2 + (2\u221an)(n) * 2 + ... Wait, no, that's not the right approach. Let me correctly expand it:\n\n= (n)^2 + (2\u221an)^2 + (4)^2 + 2*(n)*(2\u221an) + 2*(n)*4 + 2*(2\u221an)*4.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The correct expansion is:\n\n= n\u00b2 + (2\u221an)^2 +4\u00b2 + 2*(n)*(2\u221an) + 2*(n)*4 + 2*(2\u221an)*4.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The correct expansion is (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. So in this case, a = n, b = 2\u221an, c=4.\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 = n\u00b2,\n\nb\u00b2 = (2\u221an)^2 = 4n,\n\nc\u00b2 = 16,\n\n2ab = 2*(n)*(2\u221an) )=4n\u221an,\n\n2ac = 2*(n)*4=8n,\n\n2bc=2*(2\u221an)*4=16\u221an.\n\nSo adding all together:\n\nn\u00b2 +4n +16 +4n\u221an +8n +16\u221an.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nn\u00b2 + (4n +8n) + (4n\u221an) + (16\u221an) +16.\n\nWhich is n\u00b2 +12n +4n\u221an +16\u221an +16.\n\nBut the original numerator is n\u00b2 +2n\u221an +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo that doesn't match. Hmm. So perhaps the numerator isn't (n + 2\u221an +4)^2.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try a different approach. Let me see: the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let me factor the numerator. Wait, maybe the numerator can be written as (n + a\u221an + b)^2. Let me try to find a and b such that when I expand it, it matches the numerator.\n\nLet me set (n + a\u221an + b)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16.\n\nExpanding the left side: n\u00b2 + 2a n\u221an + 2b n + a\u00b2 n + 2ab \u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nSo equating to the numerator:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2n\u221an +8\u221an +16 = n\u00b2 + (2a n\u221an) + (2b n + a\u00b2 n) + (2ab \u221an) + b\u00b2.\n\nSo let's match the coefficients term by term.\n\nn\u00b2 terms: 1 on both sides, okay.\n\nn\u221an term: 2a n\u221an must equal 2n\u221an. So 2a=2 \u2192 a=1.\n\nn term: 2b n +a\u00b2 n. Since a=1, a\u00b2=1. So 2b n + n. So the coefficient of n in the numerator is 0 (since the numerator doesn't have an n term, only n\u00b2, n\u221an, \u221an, and constants). So 2b +1 =0 \u2192 2b =-1 \u2192 b= -1/2.\n\nHmm, but let's see. Then, the \u221an term: 2ab \u221an. a is 1, b is -1/2. So 2*(1)*(-1/2)= -1. So 2ab\u221an = -\u221an. But in the numerator, the \u221an term is 8\u221an. So this doesn't match. So this approach isn't working. Maybe I need to try a different a and b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator can be factored as (\u221an + something)^4? That might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator in another way.\n\nWait, maybe the numerator can be expressed as (n + something)^2 plus something else, but perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator is a square plus a square.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Since I can't seem to factor the numerator directly, perhaps I can express the entire expression x as something else. Let me try dividing numerator and denominator by \u221an.\n\nWait, but wait. The denominator is (\u221an +2)^2, so perhaps I can express x as [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16] / (\u221an +2)^2.\n\nLet me compute the numerator again. n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let me expand that: n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor this as (n + 2\u221an +4)^2. Let me check:\n\n(n + 2\u221an +4)^2 = n\u00b2 + (2\u221an)^2 +4\u00b2 + 2*n*(2\u221an) + 2*n*4 + 2*(2\u221an)*4.\n\nWait, that's n\u00b2 +4n +16 +4n\u221an +8n +16\u221an.\n\nWhich is n\u00b2 + (4n +8n) +4n\u221an +16\u221an +16 \u2192 n\u00b2 +12n +4n\u221an +16\u221an +16.\n\nBut our numerator is n\u00b2 +2n\u221an +8\u221an +16. So that's not matching. Hmm, so perhaps that's not the way.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider a substitution. Let me let m = \u221an. Since n is between 36 and 72, m would be between 6 and sqrt(72) which is approximately 8.485. So m \u2208 [6, 8.485].\n\nSo substituting m = \u221an, then n = m\u00b2. Let's rewrite the expression x in terms of m.\n\nSo numerator becomes:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16 = (m\u00b2)^2 + 2m*(m\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nWhich is m^4 + 2m(m\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nExpanding 2m(m\u00b2 +4) \u2192 2m^3 +8m.\n\nSo numerator is m^4 +2m^3 +8m +16.\n\nDenominator is n +4\u221an +4 = m\u00b2 +4m +4.\n\nWhich is (m+2)^2.\n\nSo x becomes [m^4 +2m^3 +8m +16] / (m+2)^2.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor the numerator. Let's see: m^4 +2m^3 +8m +16. Let me try to factor it.\n\nLet me try grouping terms: (m^4 +2m^3) + (8m +16). Factor m^3 from the first group: m^3(m +2) + 8(m +2). So that's (m+2)(m^3 +8).\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the numerator becomes (m+2)(m^3 +8). And m^3 +8 is a sum of cubes, which can be factored as (m + 2)(m\u00b2 -2m +4).\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nNumerator = (m+2)(m^3 +8) = (m+2)(m+2)(m\u00b2 -2m +4) = (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4).\n\nDenominator is (m+2)^2.\n\nSo x = [(m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4)] / (m+2)^2.\n\nThe (m+2)^2 terms cancel out, so x = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nWow, that's a big simplification! So x = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nSince m = \u221an, and n is between 36 and72, m is between 6 and approximately 8.485.\n\nSo x = m\u00b2 - 2m +4.\n\nNow, I can express x as a function of m: x(m) = m\u00b2 - 2m +4.\n\nI need to find the range of x when m is between 6 and about 8.485.\n\nSo let me compute x at m=6 and m=8.485.\n\nAt m=6: x = 6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nAt m=8.485: let's compute that.\n\nBut wait, 8.485 squared is about 72, because sqrt(72) is about 8.485. So m=8.485 \u2192 m\u00b2=72.\n\nSo x=72 - 2*(8.485) +4.\n\nCompute 2*8.485=16.97.\n\nSo 72 -16.97 +4 = 72 +4 =76 minus 16.97 \u2192 59.03.\n\nSo when m is 6, x=28; when m is about 8.485, x is about 59.03.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, m= sqrt(72) is exactly 6*sqrt(2), which is approximately 8.485281374.\n\nSo m=6: x=6\u00b2 -2*6 +4=36-12+4=28.\n\nm=8.485281374: x= (8.485281374)^2 - 2*(8.485281374) +4.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(8.485281374)^2 = 72.\n\n2*(8.485281374)=16.97056275.\n\nSo x=72 -16.97056275 +4 = (72 +4) -16.97056275 \u219276 -16.97056275=59.02943725.\n\nSo x is between 28 and approximately 59.03.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check if x is increasing or decreasing as m increases. Since x is a quadratic function of m: x(m)=m\u00b2 -2m +4. The derivative is 2m -2. Since m is >=6, which is greater than 1, the derivative is positive. So x is increasing as m increases. So the minimum x is at m=6 (x=28), and maximum at m=8.485 (x\u224859.03).\n\nWait, but wait, let's make sure. Let me compute x at m=6: 36-12+4=28.\n\nAt m=7: x=49-14+4=39.\n\nAt m=8: x=64-16+4=52.\n\nAt m=8.485: x\u224859.03.\n\nSo the range of x is from 28 up to approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 < x < 54 \u2192 no, because 59.03 is higher than 54.\n\nB)23 < x <58 \u2192 59.03 is higher than 58, so x can be up to about 59, so this option's upper limit is 58, which would exclude some of the x values.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 x ranges from 28 to ~59.03, which is within 25 to 64. So this option includes all x values.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 x starts at 28, so this would exclude x=28. Also, the maximum is about 59.03, so 60 is just above, so this option's upper limit is 60, which includes all x.\n\nE)None of these.\n\nWait, but wait. The options are:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 no, because x can go up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 x can go up to ~59, so 58 would be less than that. So x could be as high as ~59.03, which is above 58. So option B's upper limit is 58, which is lower than the actual maximum of x. So option B's upper bound is too low.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 25 is lower than 28, so x starts at 28, which is higher than 25. So x is from 28 to ~59.03, which is within 25 to 64. So option C includes all x values.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 x starts at 28, so 28 is included in D as the lower bound. So x ranges from 28 to ~59.03, which is less than 60. So D's range is 28 <x <60. So x can be 28 (when m=6), but the option says x is greater than 28, so 28 is excluded. But in reality, x can be 28, so option D's lower bound is too high.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem states 36 \u2264n \u226472. So n is 36, which makes m=6. So when n=36, m=6, x=28. So x=28 is included. But option D's lower limit is 28 <x, so 28 is not included. But x can be exactly 28, so D's lower bound is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait, when n=36, m=6, x=28. So x can be 28. So in the options, the lower bound must include 28. So looking at the options:\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. So x=28 is not included. But it is possible, so option D is incorrect in that aspect.\n\nOption C says 25 <x <64. Since x starts at 28, which is above 25, and goes up to ~59, which is below 64. So C includes all possible x values.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the maximum x. Wait, when m approaches sqrt(72) from below, x approaches ~59.03, which is less than 60. So option D's upper limit is 60, which includes x up to 59.03.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 includes up to 64, which is higher than x's maximum. So for x=59.03, 59.03 <64 is true.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 x can be up to 59.03, which is less than 60, so D's upper bound is correct.\n\nBut the issue is the lower bound. If x can be 28, then for D, x must be greater than 28. But when n=36, x=28. So D's lower bound is 28 <x, which excludes x=28. So the correct range would include x=28, which is not in D.\n\nSo let's check the options again.\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 x starts at 28, which is within 25 to 64. So C is correct because all x values are within 25 and 64.\n\nBut wait, let's compute the minimum x. When n=36, x=28. So x can be as low as 28. So 25 <x <64 includes all x values (28 to ~59.03).\n\nWait, but wait, what about when n is 36, x=28. So the minimum x is 28. So in option C, the lower limit is 25, which is less than 28, so 25 <x is correct for all x.\n\nWait, but wait. When n is 36, x=28, which is the minimum. So the range of x is 28 \u2264x <60 (since maximum is ~59.03).\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 includes 28 to ~59.03.\n\nOption D:28 <x <60 \u2192 excludes x=28.\n\nSo which option correctly includes x=28? Option C includes x=28 because 28 is greater than 25. So x=28 is within 25<x.\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me compute x at m=6: x=28. So 28 is included. So the range is 28 \u2264x <60 (since 59.03 is the maximum). But option C says 25 <x <64, which includes all x's from 28 up to 59.03, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, n ranges from 36 to 72. So when n=36, m=6, x=28. When n=72, m= sqrt(72)= approx 8.485, x\u224859.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to about 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 25 is less than 28, so x=28 is included. The upper limit is 64, which is higher than 59.03, so all x's are within C.\n\nOption D:28 <x <60 \u2192 the lower limit is 28, so x=28 is excluded. But x can be 28, so D is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the solution. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: If n is such that 36 \u2264 n \u2264 72, then x = (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16) divided by (n + 4\u221an + 4) satisfies one of the given options. The options are A to E, with different ranges for x.\n\nHmm, the expression for x looks a bit complicated. I think I should try simplifying it first. Let me write it down:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16] / [n + 4\u221an + 4]\n\nWait, maybe I can factor the numerator and denominator. Let's see. The numerator is n squared plus something. Oh, wait, maybe the numerator is a perfect square. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16. Hmm, that looks like it could be (something)^2. Let me think: If I have (a + b)^2, that's a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. So let's see if I can write the numerator as a square.\n\nLet me set a = n, and then see what b would be. Because the middle term is 2\u221an(n+4), which is 2ab. So 2ab = 2\u221an(n+4). So ab = \u221an(n+4). Since a is n, then b would be \u221a(n+4). Because n * \u221a(n+4) = \u221an * \u221a(n+4) * n? Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator is [\u221an + something]^2. Let's try that. Let me assume the numerator is (\u221an + c)^2, where c is some expression. Expanding that, it would be n + 2c\u221an + c\u00b2. Wait, but the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Hmm, that doesn't look right. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because (\u221an)^2 is n, but in the numerator, it's n squared. So maybe the numerator is (n + something)^2. Let me check that.\n\nWait, if I let the numerator be (n + a\u221an + b)^2, maybe that could work.

Let me see if I can match the terms to the numerator. The numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. So when expanded, that's n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an +16. Let me compare that to the expansion of (n + a\u221an + b)^2.\n\nWait, but maybe I should try a different approach. Let me consider the numerator as n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) + 16. Let me see: 2\u221an(n+4) can be written as 2n\u221an + 8\u221an. So the numerator becomes n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an +16.\n\nNow, looking at the denominator: n +4\u221an +4. Hmm, that seems like it could be (\u221an +2)^2. Let me check: (\u221an +2)^2 = n +4\u221an +4. Oh yeah, exactly. So denominator is (\u221an +2)^2.\n\nSo the denominator simplifies to (\u221an +2)^2. That's helpful.\n\nNow, back to the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an +8\u221an +16. Let me see if this can be written as (n + something)^2 plus something else.

Let me think of it as (a + b + c)^2, but that's a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe it's (n + something + something else)^2. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as (n + 2\u221an +4)^2.

The correct expansion is (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. So in this case, a = n, b = 2\u221an, c=4.\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 = n\u00b2,\n\nb\u00b2 = (2\u221an)^2 = 4n,\n\nc\u00b2 = 16,\n\n2ab = 2*(n)*(2\u221an) )=4n\u221an,\n\n2ac = 2*(n)*4=8n,\n\n2bc=2*(2\u221an)*4=16\u221an.\n\nSo adding all together:\n\nn\u00b2 +4n +16 +4n\u221an +8n +16\u221an.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nn\u00b2 + (4n +8n) + (4n\u221an) + (16\u221an) +16.\n\nWhich is n\u00b2 +12n +4n\u221an +16\u221an +16.\n\nBut the original numerator is n\u00b2 +2n\u221an +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo that doesn't match. Hmm. So perhaps the numerator isn't (n + 2\u221an +4)^2.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try a different approach. Let me see: the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let me factor the numerator. Wait, maybe the numerator can be written as (n + a\u221an + b)^2. Let me try to find a and b such that when I expand it, it matches the numerator.\n\nLet me set (n + a\u221an + b)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16.\n\nExpanding the left side: n\u00b2 + 2a n\u221an + 2b n + a\u00b2 n + 2ab \u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nSo equating to the numerator:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2n\u221an +8\u221an +16 = n\u00b2 + (2a n\u221an) + (2b n + a\u00b2 n) + (2ab \u221an) + b\u00b2.\n\nSo let's match the coefficients term by term.\n\nn\u00b2 terms: 1 on both sides, okay.\n\nn\u221an term: 2a n\u221an must equal 2n\u221an. So 2a=2 \u2192 a=1.\n\nn term: 2b n +a\u00b2 n. Since a=1, a\u00b2=1. So 2b n + n. So the coefficient of n in the numerator is 0 (since the numerator doesn't have an n term, only n\u00b2, n\u221an, \u221an, and constants). So 2b +1 =0 \u2192 2b =-1 \u2192 b= -1/2.\n\nHmm, but let's see. Then, the \u221an term: 2ab \u221an. a is 1, b is -1/2. So 2*(1)*(-1/2)= -1. So 2ab\u221an = -\u221an. But in the numerator, the \u221an term is 8\u221an. So this doesn't match. So this approach isn't working. Maybe I need to try a different a and b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator can be factored as (\u221an + something)^4? That might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator in another way.\n\nWait, maybe the numerator can be expressed as (n + something)^2 plus something else, but perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator is a square plus a square.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Since I can't seem to factor the numerator directly, perhaps I can express the entire expression x as something else. Let me try dividing numerator and denominator by \u221an.\n\nWait, but wait. The denominator is (\u221an +2)^2, so perhaps I can express x as [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16] / (\u221an +2)^2.\n\nLet me compute the numerator again. n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let me expand that: n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor this as (n + 2\u221an +4)^2. Let me check:\n\n(n + 2\u221an +4)^2 = n\u00b2 + (2\u221an)^2 +4\u00b2 + 2*n*(2\u221an) + 2*n*4 + 2*(2\u221an)*4.\n\nWait, that's n\u00b2 +4n +16 +4n\u221an +8n +16\u221an.\n\nWhich is n\u00b2 + (4n +8n) +4n\u221an +16\u221an +16 \u2192 n\u00b2 +12n +4n\u221an +16\u221an +16.\n\nBut our numerator is n\u00b2 +2n\u221an +8\u221an +16. So that's not matching. Hmm, so perhaps that's not the way.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider a substitution. Let me let m = \u221an. Since n is between 36 and 72, m would be between 6 and sqrt(72) which is approximately 8.485. So m \u2208 [6, 8.485].\n\nSo substituting m = \u221an, then n = m\u00b2. Let's rewrite the expression x in terms of m.\n\nSo numerator becomes:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16 = (m\u00b2)^2 + 2m*(m\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nWhich is m^4 + 2m(m\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nExpanding 2m(m\u00b2 +4) \u2192 2m^3 +8m.\n\nSo numerator is m^4 +2m^3 +8m +16.\n\nDenominator is n +4\u221an +4 = m\u00b2 +4m +4.\n\nWhich is (m+2)^2.\n\nSo x becomes [m^4 +2m^3 +8m +16] / (m+2)^2.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor the numerator. Let's see: m^4 +2m^3 +8m +16. Let me try to factor it.\n\nLet me try grouping terms: (m^4 +2m^3) + (8m +16). Factor m^3 from the first group: m^3(m +2) + 8(m +2). So that's (m+2)(m^3 +8).\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the numerator becomes (m+2)(m^3 +8). And m^3 +8 is a sum of cubes, which can be factored as (m + 2)(m\u00b2 -2m +4).\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nNumerator = (m+2)(m^3 +8) = (m+2)(m+2)(m\u00b2 -2m +4) = (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4).\n\nDenominator is (m+2)^2.\n\nSo x = [(m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4)] / (m+2)^2.\n\nThe (m+2)^2 terms cancel out, so x = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nWow, that's a big simplification! So x = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nSince m = \u221an, and n is between 36 and72, m is between 6 and approximately 8.485.\n\nSo x = m\u00b2 - 2m +4.\n\nNow, I can express x as a function of m: x(m) = m\u00b2 - 2m +4.\n\nI need to find the range of x when m is between 6 and about 8.485.\n\nSo let me compute x at m=6 and m=8.485.\n\nAt m=6: x = 6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nAt m=8.485: let's compute that.\n\nBut wait, 8.485 squared is about 72, because sqrt(72) is about 8.485. So m=8.485 \u2192 m\u00b2=72.\n\nSo x=72 - 2*(8.485) +4.\n\nCompute 2*8.485=16.97.\n\nSo 72 -16.97 +4 = 72 +4 =76 minus 16.97 \u2192 59.03.\n\nSo when m is 6, x=28; when m is about 8.485, x is about 59.03.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, m= sqrt(72) is exactly 6*sqrt(2), which is approximately 8.485281374.\n\nSo m=6: x=6\u00b2 -2*6 +4=36-12+4=28.\n\nm=8.485281374: x= (8.485281374)^2 - 2*(8.485281374) +4.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(8.485281374)^2 = 72.\n\n2*(8.485281374)=16.97056275.\n\nSo x=72 -16.97056275 +4 = (72 +4) -16.97056275 \u219276 -16.97056275=59.02943725.\n\nSo x is between 28 and approximately 59.03.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check if x is increasing or decreasing as m increases. Since x is a quadratic function of m: x(m)=m\u00b2 -2m +4. The derivative is 2m -2. Since m is >=6, which is greater than 1, the derivative is positive. So x is increasing as m increases. So the minimum x is at m=6 (x=28), and maximum at m=8.485 (x\u224859.03).\n\nWait, but wait, let's make sure. Let me compute x at m=6: 36-12+4=28.\n\nAt m=7: x=49-14+4=39.\n\nAt m=8: x=64-16+4=52.\n\nAt m=8.485: x\u224859.03.\n\nSo the range of x is from 28 up to approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 < x < 54 \u2192 no, because 59.03 is higher than 54.\n\nB)23 < x <58 \u2192 59.03 is higher than 58, so x can be up to about 59, so this option's upper limit is 58, which would exclude some of the x values.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 x ranges from 28 to ~59.03, which is within 25 to 64. So this option includes all x values.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 x starts at 28, so this would exclude x=28. Also, the maximum is about 59.03, so 60 is just above, so this option's upper limit is 60, which includes all x.\n\nE)None of these.\n\nWait, but wait. The options are:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 no, because x can go up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 x can go up to ~59, so 58 would be less than that. So x could be as high as ~59.03, which is above 58. So option B's upper limit is 58, which is lower than the actual maximum of x. So option B's upper bound is too low.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 25 is lower than 28, so x starts at 28, which is higher than 25. So x is from 28 to ~59.03, which is within 25 to 64. So option C includes all x values.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 x starts at 28, so 28 is included in D as the lower bound. So x ranges from 28 to ~59.03, which is less than 60. So D's range is 28 <x <60. So x can be 28 (when m=6), but the option says x is greater than 28, so 28 is excluded. But in reality, x can be 28, so option D's lower bound is too high.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem states 36 \u2264n \u226472. So n is 36, which makes m=6. So when n=36, m=6, x=28. So x=28 is included. But option D's lower limit is 28 <x, so 28 is not included. But x can be exactly 28, so D's lower bound is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait, when n=36, m=6, x=28. So x can be 28. So in the options, the lower bound must include 28. So looking at the options:\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. So x=28 is not included. But it is possible, so option D is incorrect in that aspect.\n\nOption C says 25 <x <64. Since x starts at 28, which is above 25, and goes up to ~59, which is below 64. So C includes all possible x values.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the maximum x. Wait, when m approaches sqrt(72) from below, x approaches ~59.03, which is less than 60. So option D's upper limit is 60, which includes x up to 59.03.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 includes up to 64, which is higher than x's maximum. So for x=59.03, 59.03 <64 is true.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 x can be up to 59.03, which is less than 60, so D's upper bound is correct.\n\nBut the issue is the lower bound. If x can be 28, then for D, x must be greater than 28. But when n=36, x=28. So D's lower bound is 28 <x, which excludes x=28. So the correct range would include x=28, which is not in D.\n\nSo let's check the options again.\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 x starts at 28, which is within 25 to 64. So C is correct because all x values are within 25 and 64.\n\nBut wait, let's compute the minimum x. When n=36, x=28. So x can be as low as 28. So 25 <x <64 includes all x values (28 to ~59.03).\n\nWait, but wait, what about when n is 36, x=28. So the minimum x is 28. So in option C, the lower limit is 25, which is less than 28, so 25 <x is correct for all x.\n\nWait, but wait. When n is 36, x=28, which is the minimum. So the range of x is 28 \u2264x <60 (since maximum is ~59.03).\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 includes 28 to ~59.03.\n\nOption D:28 <x <60 \u2192 excludes x=28.\n\nSo which option correctly includes x=28? Option C includes x=28 because 28 is greater than 25. So x=28 is within 25<x.\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me compute x at m=6: x=28. So 28 is included. So the range is 28 \u2264x <60 (since 59.03 is the maximum). But option C says 25 <x <64, which includes all x's from 28 up to 59.03, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, n ranges from 36 to 72. So when n=36, m=6, x=28. When n=72, m= sqrt(72)= approx 8.485, x\u224859.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to about 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 25 is less than 28, so x=28 is included. The upper limit is 64, which is higher than 59.03, so all x's are within C.\n\nOption D:28 <x <60 \u2192 the lower limit is 28, so x=28 is excluded. But x can be 28, so D is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer is C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the given expression for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Denominator\nThe denominator \\( n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4 \\) can be rewritten as \\( (\\sqrt{n} + 2)^2 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Numerator\nThe numerator \\( n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 \\) is expanded as:\n\\[\nn^2 + 2n\\sqrt{n} + 8\\sqrt{n} + 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Substitute \\( m = \\sqrt{n} \\)\nLet \\( m = \\sqrt{n} \\), so \\( n = m^2 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find out what x satisfies a certain equation, given that n is between 36 and 72. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nThe equation is x = (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4\u221an + 4). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it somehow. I remember that sometimes expressions like this can be rewritten by noticing patterns or trying to factor them.\n\nLooking at the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Wait, that seems similar to a square of a binomial. Let me think. The standard form is (a + b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. So if I can write the numerator as something squared, that might help.\n\nLet me see: Let\u2019s consider a = n, and b = something. The middle term is 2\u221an(n+4). Let's expand 2ab. So 2ab = 2 * n * b. Wait, but in the numerator, it's 2\u221an (n +4). So that would mean 2ab = 2\u221an (n +4). Let me rearrange that: 2ab = 2\u221an * n + 8\u221an. So 2ab = 2n^(3/2) + 8\u221an.\n\nWait, but that's getting a bit messy. Maybe I should think differently. Let me try to see if the numerator can be written as (\u221an + something)^2. Let me try:\n\nSuppose the numerator is (\u221an + a)^2. Then expanding it, it would be n + 2a\u221an + a\u00b2. But wait, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Hmm, maybe that approach isn't working because the first term is n squared, not n.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe the numerator is (n + something)^2. Let me try that. Let\u2019s say (n + b)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2bn + b\u00b2. Comparing to the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. So 2bn would need to be 2\u221an(n+4). So 2b n = 2\u221an (n+4). Let's solve for b: b = [\u221an (n+4)] / n = \u221an (n+4)/n. Hmm, but that seems complicated. Maybe not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator is a perfect square of a binomial with terms involving \u221an. Let me think of the numerator as (something + something else)^2. Let me suppose it's (\u221an + c)^2. Then that would give n + 2c\u221an + c\u00b2. But wait, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16, which is n\u00b2 plus a term with \u221an. So that approach doesn't match because the first term is n squared, not n.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me try to see if the numerator and denominator can be factored or simplified separately. Let's look at the denominator first: n + 4\u221an +4. Wait, that looks like it could be a perfect square as well. Let's see: n +4\u221an +4 = (\u221an + 2)^2 because (\u221an)^2 is n, and 2*\u221an*2 is 4\u221an, and 2^2 is 4. So yes, denominator is (\u221an + 2)^2. That's a good start.\n\nSo denominator = (\u221an + 2)^2.\n\nNow the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Let me write it out: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16. Hmm, can I factor this somehow? Maybe I can see it as n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n) + 8\u221an +16. Wait, that becomes n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) + 8\u221an +16.\n\nNot sure if that helps. Let me think of the numerator as n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) + 16. Let me try to write it as (n + something)^2. Let's try (n + a)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2a n + a\u00b2. Comparing to the numerator:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2a n + a\u00b2 = n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16.\n\nSo 2a n = 2\u221an (n +4). Let me solve for a:\n\nDivide both sides by 2n (assuming n \u22600, which it isn't here since n \u226536): a = [\u221an (n +4)] / n = \u221an (1 + 4/n).\n\nHmm, but then a\u00b2 would be [\u221an (1 + 4/n)]\u00b2 = n (1 + 4/n)^2. Let me compute that: n (1 + 8/n + 16/n\u00b2) = n + 8 + 16/n.\n\nBut the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16, which is way larger than n +8 +16/n. So this approach might not work. Maybe the numerator isn't a perfect square. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the numerator is (n + something else)^2. Let me try (n + 4\u221an + something)^2. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator can be written as (n + 4\u221an +4)^2 minus something. Let me compute (n +4\u221an +4)^2.\n\nWait, the denominator is (\u221an +2)^2, which is n +4\u221an +4. So if I square that, I get (denominator)^2 = (n +4\u221an +4)^2. Let me compute that:\n\n(n +4\u221an +4)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2 * n *4\u221an + 2 * n *4 + (4\u221an)^2 + 2 *4\u221an *4 +4\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's easier to compute step by step.\n\n(n +4\u221an +4)^2 = (n)^2 + 2*(n)*(4\u221an) + 2*(n)*4 + (4\u221an)^2 + 2*(4\u221an)*4 + (4)^2.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute it as (a + b + c)^2, where a =n, b=4\u221an, c=4.\n\nSo (a + b +c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc.\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\na\u00b2 = n\u00b2.\n\nb\u00b2 = (4\u221an)^2 = 16n.\n\nc\u00b2 = 16.\n\n2ab = 2 *n *4\u221an = 8n^(3/2).\n\n2ac = 2 *n *4 = 8n.\n\n2bc = 2 *4\u221an *4 = 32\u221an.\n\nSo adding all together: n\u00b2 +16n +16 +8n^(3/2) +8n +32\u221an.\n\nCombine like terms: n\u00b2 + (16n +8n) + (8n^(3/2) +32\u221an) +16.\n\nWhich is n\u00b2 +24n +8n^(3/2) +32\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16. Let's expand that: 2\u221an *n = 2n^(3/2), 2\u221an *4 =8\u221an. So numerator is n\u00b2 +2n^(3/2)+8\u221an +16.\n\nComparing to the (denominator)^2, which is n\u00b2 +24n +8n^(3/2)+32\u221an +16. Not the same, so perhaps that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. Since the denominator is (\u221an +2)^2, and the numerator is n\u00b2 +2\u221an(n+4) +16, maybe I can write the numerator in terms of the denominator.\n\nWait, let me try to write the numerator as (n + something) times (something else). Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator as (n + a)(n + b) where a and b are terms involving \u221an.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can split the numerator into two parts: n\u00b2 +16 and the middle term. So n\u00b2 +16 is part of it. Hmm, but I don't see a clear way.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor the numerator as (n + 4\u221an + something) times something else. Alternatively, perhaps the entire fraction x can be simplified by factoring both numerator and denominator.\n\nLet me see: x = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n+4) +16] / [ (\u221an +2)^2 ]\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write the numerator as (n + something)^2, but I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, perhaps I can let t = \u221an, which might make the equation look simpler.\n\nLet me try that substitution. Let t = \u221an. Then n = t\u00b2. So let's rewrite the equation in terms of t.\n\nNumerator becomes t^4 + 2 t (t\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nDenominator becomes (t + 2)^2.\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\nt^4 + 2t(t\u00b2 +4) +16 = t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nHmm, can I factor this? Let me try to factor t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nLooking for rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b14, \u00b18, \u00b116.\n\nTesting t= -2: (-2)^4 +2*(-2)^3 +8*(-2) +16 =16 +2*(-8) + (-16) +16 =16 -16 -16 +16=0. Oh, so t= -2 is a root. So (t +2) is a factor.\n\nLet me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor it out.\n\nDividing t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16 by (t +2):\n\nUsing synthetic division for t = -2:\n\nCoefficients: 1 (t^4), 2 (t^3), 0 (t^2), 8 (t), 16.\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -2: -2. Add to next coefficient: 2 + (-2) = 0.\n\nMultiply 0 by -2: 0. Add to next (t^2 term): 0 +0=0.\n\nMultiply 0 by -2:0. Add to t term: 8 +0=8.\n\nMultiply 8 by -2: -16. Add to 16: 0.\n\nSo the result is t^3 +0 t^2 +0 t +8. So numerator is (t +2)(t^3 +8).\n\nWait, but t^3 +8 can be factored as (t +2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4), since a^3 +b^3 = (a +b)(a\u00b2 -ab +b\u00b2). So a is t, b is 2.\n\nSo numerator becomes (t +2)^2 (t\u00b2 - 2t +4).\n\nSo now, the numerator is (t +2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4), and the denominator is (t +2)^2.\n\nSo x = [ (t +2)^2 (t\u00b2 - 2t +4) ] / (t +2)^2 = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nSo x = t\u00b2 - 2t +4, where t =\u221an.\n\nWait, that's a big simplification! So x = (\u221an)^2 - 2\u221an +4. Because t is \u221an.\n\nSo x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, because t squared is (\u221an)^2 =n.\n\nSo x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nNow, that's much simpler. So x is expressed as x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nNow, I need to find the range of x when n is between 36 and 72.\n\nSo n ranges from 36 to72, inclusive.\n\nSo let's compute x for n=36 and n=72.\n\nFirst, for n=36:\n\nx =36 -2\u221a36 +4.\n\n\u221a36 is 6.\n\nSo x=36 - 2*6 +4=36 -12 +4=28.\n\nThen for n=72:\n\nx=72 -2\u221a72 +4.\n\n\u221a72 is sqrt(36*2)=6\u221a2\u22488.485.\n\nSo 2\u221a72 \u2248 16.97.\n\nSo x\u224872 -16.97 +4= (72+4) -16.97 =76 -16.97\u224859.03.\n\nBut wait, let me compute it more accurately. \u221a72 is exactly 6\u221a2, so 2\u221a72=12\u221a2. So x=72 +4 -12\u221a2=76 -12\u221a2.\n\n12\u221a2 is approximately 12 *1.4142\u224816.9704. So 76-16.9704\u224859.0296.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when n increases, how does x behave?\n\nLet me take the function x =n -2\u221an +4. Let me see if this function is increasing or has a minimum.\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to n: dx/dn =1 - (2*(1/(2\u221an))) )= 1 - (1/\u221an).\n\nSetting derivative to zero: 1 - 1/\u221an =0 \u2192 1=1/\u221an \u2192\u221an=1 \u2192n=1. But our n is in 36 to72, so the derivative is positive in this interval because 1/\u221an is less than 1 when n>1. So for n>1, 1 -1/\u221an is positive. So the function x is increasing for n>1.\n\nSo since x is increasing in the interval 36 \u2264n \u226472, the minimum value is at n=36 (x=28), and maximum at n=72 (x\u224859.03).\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to about 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 No, since x can be up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 58 is less than 59, so 58 <59.03, so x could be up to ~59, so 58 is less than the maximum. So 23 <x <58: 28 is greater than 23, and 59 is greater than 58, so this option is not correct.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 28 is greater than 25, and 59 is less than 64. So this option says x is between 25 and64. But our x starts at 28, so the lower bound is 28, which is above 25, and upper is ~59, which is below 64. So C says x is in 25-64, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: the x at n=36 is 28, and at n=72 is ~59.03. So x is between 28 and ~59.03. So the range is 28 <x < ~59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 yes, because 59.03 is less than 60. So 28 <x <60 would include all values of x in the range.\n\nOption C is 25 <x <64. So our x is between 28 and 59.03, which is within 25 and 64. So C is also possible.\n\nWait, but the question is about what x satisfies. So if x is between 28 and about 59, then both C and D could be possible.\n\nWait, let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 no, because x can go up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 no, since x can be up to ~59, which is above 58.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, because 28 is above 25, and 59 is below 64.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 yes, because x starts at 28, and ends at ~59 which is less than 60.\n\nSo both options C and D include the x range. But which one is correct?\n\nWait, the correct range is 28 <x <~59.03. So option D says 28 <x <60. That's correct because 59.03 is less than 60. So D is correct.\n\nOption C says 25 <x <64. Which is also correct, because x is between 28 and 59, which is within 25 and 64.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"satisfies\" one of the options. So if both options C and D are correct, but the options don't have overlapping ranges, which one is correct?\n\nWait, looking back at the options:\n\nOption D is 28 <x <60.\n\nOption C is 25 <x <64.\n\nSince the correct x is between 28 and ~59.03, both C and D would include this range. But let me double-check.\n\nWait, no. Because D's lower bound is 28, which matches the minimum x. C's lower bound is 25, which is below the minimum x of 28. So x is above 28, so C is correct because 25 <28, and x is up to 59 which is less than 64. So C is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the x is 28 when n=36, and as n increases, x increases. So the minimum x is 28, maximum is ~59. So the x must be greater than 28 and less than 59.03. So the correct option must have a lower bound below 28 and upper bound above 59.03.\n\nLooking again, option C is 25 <x <64. So 25 is below 28, 64 is above 59, so x is within 25 and 64. So x satisfies 25 <x <64.\n\nOption D is 28 <x <60. So 28 is the minimum, and 60 is above 59.03, so x is within 28 and 60. So both C and D are possible?\n\nWait, but wait. The x can't be less than 28. So the correct range is x >28 and x <~59.03. So any option that includes this range is correct.\n\nSo options C and D both include this range. But the question is asking which option x satisfies. So perhaps I made a mistake in my simplification.\n\nWait, let me recheck the substitution. When I let t=\u221an, and simplified x to t\u00b2-2t +4, which is n -2\u221an +4. So for n=36, x=36-12+4=28. For n=72, x=72-2*(6\u221a2)+4=76 -12\u221a2\u224876-16.97=59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to ~59.03.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60. So 59.03 is less than 60, so x is in 28 <x <60. So D is correct.\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64. x is between 28 and 59.03, so this is also correct.\n\nWait, but the problem is a multiple-choice question. So which option is correct? If both C and D include the correct range, but the options are exclusive, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me check the calculation for x again.\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16]/[n +4\u221an +4]\n\nWe did a substitution t=\u221an, leading to x = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nWait, let me recheck that. When I did the substitution, I had:\n\nNumerator: t^4 + 2t(t^2 +4) +16 = t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nDenominator: (t+2)^2.\n\nFactoring numerator, we found it factors as (t+2)^2 (t^2 - 2t +4). So x becomes (t^2 -2t +4). So yes, x = t^2 -2t +4 = (\u221an)^2 -2\u221an +4 =n -2\u221an +4.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo for n=36, x=36-12+4=28.\n\nn=72: x=72-2*6\u221a2 +4=76-12\u221a2\u224876-16.97\u224859.03.\n\nSo the x is between 28 and ~59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 yes.\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 also yes.\n\nBut the problem is that both options C and D include the x range. But perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the numerator simplification.\n\nWait, the numerator after substitution was t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16, which we factored as (t+2)^2 (t^2-2t+4).\n\nLet me multiply (t+2)^2 by (t^2 -2t +4) to make sure.\n\n(t+2)^2 = t\u00b2 +4t +4.\n\nMultiply by (t\u00b2 -2t +4):\n\n(t\u00b2)(t\u00b2-2t+4) = t^4 -2t^3 +4t\u00b2.\n\n(4t)(t\u00b2-2t+4) =4t^3 -8t\u00b2 +16t.\n\n(4)(t\u00b2-2t+4)=4t\u00b2 -8t +16.\n\nAdding all together:\n\nt^4 -2t^3 +4t\u00b2 +4t^3 -8t\u00b2 +16t +4t\u00b2 -8t +16.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nt^4: 1.\n\nt^3: (-2t^3 +4t^3)=2t^3.\n\nt^2: (4t\u00b2 -8t\u00b2 +4t\u00b2) =0.\n\nt terms: (16t -8t)=8t.\n\nConstants: +16.\n\nSo the product is t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16, which matches the numerator. So the factoring is correct.\n\nSo x is correctly simplified to t^2 -2t +4, which is n -2\u221an +4.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to ~59.03.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 yes, because 59.03 is less than 60.\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 also yes, because 59.03 is less than 64.\n\nSo both options C and D include the x range. But the options are supposed to be exclusive.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me recheck the substitution.\n\nWait, the original equation is x = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16]/[n +4\u221an +4].\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute x for n=36 and n=72 again.\n\nn=36:\n\nx = (36\u00b2 + 2\u221a36*(36+4) +16) / (36 +4\u221a36 +4).\n\nCompute numerator: 36\u00b2=1296.\n\n2\u221a36*(36+4) =2*6*(40)=12*40=480.\n\n16.\n\nTotal numerator:1296 +480 +16 = 1792.\n\nDenominator:36 +4*6 +4 =36 +24 +4=64.\n\nSo x=1792 /64=28. Correct.\n\nn=72:\n\nNumerator:72\u00b2 + 2\u221a72*(72+4) +16.\n\n72\u00b2=5184.\n\n\u221a72=6\u221a2.\n\n2\u221a72*(76) =2*6\u221a2 *76=12\u221a2*76=912\u221a2.\n\n16.\n\nSo numerator=5184 +912\u221a2 +16=5200 +912\u221a2.\n\nDenominator:72 +4\u221a72 +4 =76 +4*6\u221a2 =76 +24\u221a2.\n\nSo x=(5200 +912\u221a2)/(76 +24\u221a2).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor numerator and denominator.\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:5200 +912\u221a2 = let's see, 5200= 76 * 68.421... Not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor out 8:\n\n5200=8*650, 912=8*114.\n\nSo 5200 +912\u221a2=8*(650 +114\u221a2).\n\nDenominator:76 +24\u221a2=4*(19 +6\u221a2).\n\nWait, 76=4*19, 24\u221a2=4*6\u221a2. So denominator=4*(19 +6\u221a2).\n\nSo x= [8*(650 +114\u221a2)] / [4*(19 +6\u221a2)] = 2*(650 +114\u221a2)/(19 +6\u221a2).\n\nLet me compute (650 +114\u221a2)/(19 +6\u221a2).\n\nLet me rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by (19 -6\u221a2):\n\n[(650 +114\u221a2)(19 -6\u221a2)] / [(19)^2 - (6\u221a2)^2].\n\nCompute denominator: 361 - (36 *2) =361 -72=289.\n\nNumerator: Let me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, 650 *19 = 12350.\n\n650*(-6\u221a2)= -3900\u221a2.\n\n114\u221a2 *19= 2166\u221a2.\n\n114\u221a2*(-6\u221a2) = -684*(\u221a2)^2= -684*2= -1368.\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\n12350 -3900\u221a2 +2166\u221a2 -1368.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nConstants:12350 -1368 =10982.\n\n\u221a2 terms: (-3900 +2166)\u221a2= (-1734)\u221a2.\n\nSo numerator: 10982 -1734\u221a2.\n\nDenominator:289.\n\nSo x=2*(10982 -1734\u221a2)/289.\n\nCompute 10982 /289: 289 *38=10982 (because 289 *30=8670, 289 *8=2312; 8670+2312=10982).\n\nSo 10982 /289=38.\n\nSimilarly, 1734 /289: 289 *6=1734.\n\nSo numerator becomes 38 -6\u221a2.\n\nSo x=2*(38 -6\u221a2)=76 -12\u221a2.\n\nWhich is the same as before, approximately 76 -16.97\u224859.03.\n\nSo x is 76 -12\u221a2, which is exactly around 59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nSo the correct options would be those that include this interval.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. Since 59.03 <60, this is correct.\n\nOption C says 25 <x <64. 28 is above 25, 59.03 is below 64. So this is also correct.\n\nHmm, but the options are supposed to have only one correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification.\n\nWait, perhaps the function x is not strictly increasing. Let me check for n between 36 and72.\n\nWe have x =n -2\u221an +4. Let me compute the derivative dx/dn =1 - (2/(2\u221an)) )=1 - (1/\u221an).\n\nAt n=36: 1 -1/6 \u22480.833>0.\n\nAt n=72:1 -1/(sqrt(72))=1 -1/(6\u221a2)=1 -1/(8.485)\u22481-0.1178\u22480.882>0.\n\nSo derivative is positive throughout the interval, so x increases as n increases. So x is between 28 and ~59.03.\n\nSo the x is strictly between 28 and ~59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D:28 <x <60 \u2192 correct, as 59.03 is less than 60.\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 also correct, but the lower bound is lower than the actual minimum.\n\nBut the question is about which option x satisfies. So both C and D are correct? But that can't be, as it's a multiple-choice question.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification. Let me re-examine the initial equation.\n\nWait, the initial equation is x = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16 ] / [n +4\u221an +4].\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute x for n=36 and n=72 again.\n\nn=36:\n\nNumerator:36\u00b2 +2*6*(36+4) +16=1296 +2*6*40 +16=1296 +480 +16=1792.\n\nDenominator:36 +4*6 +4=36+24+4=64.\n\nx=1792/64=28.

So D is correct.\n\nOption C says 25 <x <64, which also includes the range. But D is more precise.\n\nWait, but the options are presented as the correct range that x must satisfy. So the correct answer would be the one that x is between 28 and 59.03.\n\nSo option D is 28 <x <60, which is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check another point. Let me pick n=49, which is in the range.\n\nn=49.\n\nx=49 -2*7 +4=49-14+4=39.\n\nSo x=39, which is within option D's range (28 <39 <60), and also within option C's range (25 <39 <64).\n\nSo both options C and D are correct.\n\nBut the options are given as multiple-choice, so perhaps the intended answer is D, because it's more specific.\n\nWait, but let me look at the options again:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 no.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 no.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 yes.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 yes.\n\nE)None of these.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"satisfies\" one of these options. If both C and D are correct, then perhaps E is not the answer. But wait, the options are presented as choices, so perhaps only one is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute x for n=36 and n=72 again.\n\nWait, for n=36, x=28. So x is exactly 28. So the lower bound is 28, not greater than. So for option D, it's 28 <x <60. But x can be equal to 28, so the correct option should have x \u226528, but the options are inequalities, not including equality.\n\nWait, the question says \"satisfies\", so perhaps the correct option is the one where x is strictly greater than 28 and less than 60. So option D is 28 <x <60.\n\nBut when n=36, x=28. So x can be equal to 28. So if the option is \"28 <x <60\", then x=28 is not included, which is incorrect because x can be 28.\n\nWait, but when n=36, x=28. So the range is x \u226528 and x \u226459.03. So the correct option would be one that includes x=28 and up to ~59.03.\n\nLooking at the options, none of the options include 28 as a possible x. Because all options have lower bounds less than 28 or higher, but the upper bounds may vary.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 x=28 is in this range.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 x=28 is in this range.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 x=28 is in this range.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 x=28 is not in this range, since it's strictly greater than 28.\n\nSo when n=36, x=28. So the correct option must include x=28.\n\nThus, option D is incorrect because it excludes x=28. So the correct answer must be an option that includes 28 as a possible value.\n\nLooking back, option C:25 <x <64 includes x=28. Option D excludes x=28.\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that x starts at 28 and goes up to ~59.03. So the correct x must be \u226528 and \u226459.03. So the correct option must include 28 and up.\n\nLooking at the options, only option C includes 28, as it's from 25 to64.\n\nBut option D is 28 <x <60, which excludes x=28.\n\nThus, the correct answer would be C, because when n=36, x=28 is included in the range.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that x increases from 28 to ~59.03, so x can be 28 and up to 59.03.\n\nSo the range is 28 \u2264x <59.03.\n\nLooking at the options, which one includes this range.\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, because 28 is within 25 to64.\n\nOption D:28 <x <60 \u2192 no, because x can be 28, but D's lower bound is x>28.\n\nThus, the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. The problem says \"satisfies\", which I think refers to the x being in that interval for all n in 36\u2264n\u226472.\n\nWait, no, it's for a given n in that range, x is in which interval.\n\nSo for each n, x is between 28 and ~59.03. So the correct interval is 28\u2264x\u226459.03.\n\nLooking for the option that includes this interval.\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, 28 is within 25, and 59 is within 64.\n\nOption D:28 <x <60 \u2192 x=28 is not included.\n\nSo the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that x is 28 when n=36, and increases to ~59. So x can be 28, so the correct option must include 28.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C, because it includes 28.\n\nBut looking back at the options, the question is phrased as \"x satisfies\".\n\nIf the options are:\n\nA)20 <x <54\n\nB)23 <x <58\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nE)None of these.\n\nSince x can be as low as 28 and as high as ~59.03, the correct option is C, because 25 <28 and 59.03 <64. So x is within 25 and64.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again: x is between 28 and ~59.03. So option C is 25 <x <64. So x is within this range. So the correct answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, if the options don't include an option that starts at 28, then E might be the answer.\n\nWait, but option C includes the entire range of x, so the correct answer is C.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought x starts at 28, I thought option D was correct, but since x can be exactly 28, option D (which starts at x>28) is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find out what x satisfies a certain equation, given that n is between 36 and 72. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nThe equation is x = (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4\u221an + 4). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it somehow. I remember that sometimes expressions like this can be rewritten by noticing patterns or trying to factor them.\n\nLooking at the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Wait, that seems similar to a square of a binomial. Let me think. The standard form is (a + b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. So if I can write the numerator as something squared, that might help.\n\nLet me see: Let\u2019s consider a = n, and b = something. The middle term is 2\u221an(n+4). Let's expand 2ab. So 2ab = 2 * n * b. Wait, but in the numerator, it's 2\u221an (n +4). So that would mean 2ab = 2\u221an (n +4). Let me rearrange that: 2ab = 2\u221an * n + 8\u221an. So 2ab = 2n^(3/2) + 8\u221an.\n\nWait, but that's getting a bit messy. Maybe I should think differently. Let me try to see if the numerator can be written as (\u221an + something)^2. Let me try:\n\nSuppose the numerator is (\u221an + a)^2. Then expanding it, it would be n + 2a\u221an + a\u00b2. But wait, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Hmm, maybe that approach isn't working because the first term is n squared, not n.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe the numerator is (n + something)^2. Let me try that. Let\u2019s say (n + b)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2bn + b\u00b2. Comparing to the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. So 2bn would need to be 2\u221an(n+4). So 2b n = 2\u221an (n+4). Let's solve for b: b = [\u221an (n+4)] / n = \u221an (n+4)/n. Hmm, but that seems complicated. Maybe not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator is a perfect square of a binomial with terms involving \u221an. Let me think of the numerator as (something + something else)^2. Let me suppose it's (\u221an + c)^2. Then that would give n + 2c\u221an + c\u00b2. But wait, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16, which is n\u00b2 plus a term with \u221an. So that approach doesn't match because the first term is n squared, not n.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me try to see if the numerator and denominator can be factored or simplified separately. Let's look at the denominator first: n + 4\u221an +4. Wait, that looks like it could be a perfect square as well. Let's see: n +4\u221an +4 = (\u221an + 2)^2 because (\u221an)^2 is n, and 2*\u221an*2 is 4\u221an, and 2^2 is 4. So yes, denominator is (\u221an + 2)^2. That's a good start.\n\nSo denominator = (\u221an + 2)^2.\n\nNow the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Let me write it out: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16. Hmm, can I factor this somehow? Maybe I can see it as n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n) + 8\u221an +16. Wait, that becomes n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) + 8\u221an +16.\n\nNot sure if that helps. Let me think of the numerator as n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) + 16. Let me try to write it as (n + something)^2. Let's try (n + a)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2a n + a\u00b2. Comparing to the numerator:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2a n + a\u00b2 = n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16.\n\nSo 2a n = 2\u221an (n +4). Let me solve for a:\n\nDivide both sides by 2n (assuming n \u22600, which it isn't here since n \u226536): a = [\u221an (n +4)] / n = \u221an (1 + 4/n).\n\nHmm, but then a\u00b2 would be [\u221an (1 + 4/n)]\u00b2 = n (1 + 4/n)^2. Let me compute that: n (1 + 8/n + 16/n\u00b2) = n + 8 + 16/n.\n\nBut the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16, which is way larger than n +8 +16/n. So this approach might not work. Maybe the numerator isn't a perfect square. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the numerator is (n + something else)^2. Let me try (n + 4\u221an + something)^2. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator can be written as (n + 4\u221an +4)^2 minus something. Let me compute (n +4\u221an +4)^2.\n\nWait, the denominator is (\u221an +2)^2, which is n +4\u221an +4. So if I square that, I get (denominator)^2 = (n +4\u221an +4)^2. Let me compute that:\n\n(n +4\u221an +4)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2 * n *4\u221an + 2 * n *4 + (4\u221an)^2 + 2 *4\u221an *4 +4\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's easier to compute step by step.\n\n(n +4\u221an +4)^2 = (n)^2 + 2*(n)*(4\u221an) + 2*(n)*4 + (4\u221an)^2 + 2*(4\u221an)*4 + (4)^2.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute it as (a + b + c)^2, where a =n, b=4\u221an, c=4.\n\nSo (a + b +c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc.\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\na\u00b2 = n\u00b2.\n\nb\u00b2 = (4\u221an)^2 = 16n.\n\nc\u00b2 = 16.\n\n2ab = 2 *n *4\u221an = 8n^(3/2).\n\n2ac = 2 *n *4 = 8n.\n\n2bc = 2 *4\u221an *4 = 32\u221an.\n\nSo adding all together: n\u00b2 +16n +16 +8n^(3/2) +8n +32\u221an.\n\nCombine like terms: n\u00b2 + (16n +8n) + (8n^(3/2) +32\u221an) +16.\n\nWhich is n\u00b2 +24n +8n^(3/2) +32\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16. Let's expand that: 2\u221an *n = 2n^(3/2), 2\u221an *4 =8\u221an. So numerator is n\u00b2 +2n^(3/2)+8\u221an +16.\n\nComparing to the (denominator)^2, which is n\u00b2 +24n +8n^(3/2)+32\u221an +16. Not the same, so perhaps that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. Since the denominator is (\u221an +2)^2, and the numerator is n\u00b2 +2\u221an(n+4) +16, maybe I can write the numerator in terms of the denominator.\n\nWait, let me try to write the numerator as (n + something) times (something else). Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator as (n + a)(n + b) where a and b are terms involving \u221an.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can split the numerator into two parts: n\u00b2 +16 and the middle term. So n\u00b2 +16 is part of it. Hmm, but I don't see a clear way.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor the numerator as (n + 4\u221an + something) times something else. Alternatively, perhaps the entire fraction x can be simplified by factoring both numerator and denominator.\n\nLet me see: x = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n+4) +16] / [ (\u221an +2)^2 ]\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write the numerator as (n + something)^2, but I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, perhaps I can let t = \u221an, which might make the equation look simpler.\n\nLet me try that substitution. Let t = \u221an. Then n = t\u00b2. So let's rewrite the equation in terms of t.\n\nNumerator becomes t^4 + 2 t (t\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nDenominator becomes (t + 2)^2.\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\nt^4 + 2t(t\u00b2 +4) +16 = t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nHmm, can I factor this? Let me try to factor t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nLooking for rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b14, \u00b18, \u00b116.\n\nTesting t= -2: (-2)^4 +2*(-2)^3 +8*(-2) +16 =16 +2*(-8) + (-16) +16 =16 -16 -16 +16=0. Oh, so t= -2 is a root. So (t +2) is a factor.\n\nLet me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor it out.\n\nDividing t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16 by (t +2):\n\nUsing synthetic division for t = -2:\n\nCoefficients: 1 (t^4), 2 (t^3), 0 (t^2), 8 (t), 16.\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -2: -2. Add to next coefficient: 2 + (-2) = 0.\n\nMultiply 0 by -2: 0. Add to next (t^2 term): 0 +0=0.\n\nMultiply 0 by -2:0. Add to t term: 8 +0=8.\n\nMultiply 8 by -2: -16. Add to 16: 0.\n\nSo the result is t^3 +0 t^2 +0 t +8. So numerator is (t +2)(t^3 +8).\n\nWait, but t^3 +8 can be factored as (t +2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4), since a^3 +b^3 = (a +b)(a\u00b2 -ab +b\u00b2). So a is t, b is 2.\n\nSo numerator becomes (t +2)^2 (t\u00b2 - 2t +4).\n\nSo now, the numerator is (t +2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4), and the denominator is (t +2)^2.\n\nSo x = [ (t +2)^2 (t\u00b2 - 2t +4) ] / (t +2)^2 = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nSo x = t\u00b2 - 2t +4, where t =\u221an.\n\nWait, that's a big simplification! So x = (\u221an)^2 - 2\u221an +4. Because t is \u221an.\n\nSo x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, because t squared is (\u221an)^2 =n.\n\nSo x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nNow, that's much simpler. So x is expressed as x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nNow, I need to find the range of x when n is between 36 and 72.\n\nSo n ranges from 36 to72, inclusive.\n\nSo let's compute x for n=36 and n=72.\n\nFirst, for n=36:\n\nx =36 -2\u221a36 +4.\n\n\u221a36 is 6.\n\nSo x=36 - 2*6 +4=36 -12 +4=28.\n\nThen for n=72:\n\nx=72 -2\u221a72 +4.\n\n\u221a72 is sqrt(36*2)=6\u221a2\u22488.485.\n\nSo 2\u221a72 \u2248 16.97.\n\nSo x\u224872 -16.97 +4= (72+4) -16.97 =76 -16.97\u224859.03.\n\nBut wait, let me compute it more accurately. \u221a72 is exactly 6\u221a2, so 2\u221a72=12\u221a2. So x=72 +4 -12\u221a2=76 -12\u221a2.\n\n12\u221a2 is approximately 12 *1.4142\u224816.9704. So 76-16.9704\u224859.0296.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when n increases, how does x behave?\n\nLet me take the function x =n -2\u221an +4. Let me see if this function is increasing or has a minimum.\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to n: dx/dn =1 - (2*(1/(2\u221an))) )= 1 - (1/\u221an).\n\nSetting derivative to zero: 1 - 1/\u221an =0 \u2192 1=1/\u221an \u2192\u221an=1 \u2192n=1. But our n is in 36 to72, so the derivative is positive in this interval because 1/\u221an is less than 1 when n>1. So for n>1, 1 -1/\u221an is positive. So the function x is increasing for n>1.\n\nSo since x is increasing in the interval 36 \u2264n \u226472, the minimum value is at n=36 (x=28), and maximum at n=72 (x\u224859.03).\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to about 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 No, since x can be up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 58 is less than 59, so 58 <59.03, so x could be up to ~59, so 58 is less than the maximum. So 23 <x <58: 28 is greater than 23, and 59 is greater than 58, so this option is not correct.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 28 is greater than 25, and 59 is less than 64. So this option says x is between 25 and64. But our x starts at 28, so the lower bound is 28, which is above 25, and upper is ~59, which is below 64. So C says x is in 25-64, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: the x at n=36 is 28, and at n=72 is ~59.03. So x is between 28 and ~59.03. So the range is 28 <x < ~59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 yes, because 59.03 is less than 60. So 28 <x <60 would include all values of x in the range.\n\nOption C is 25 <x <64. So our x is between 28 and 59.03, which is within 25 and 64. So C is also possible.\n\nWait, but the question is about what x satisfies. So if x is between 28 and about 59, then both C and D could be possible.\n\nWait, let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 no, because x can go up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 no, since x can be up to ~59, which is above 58.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, because 28 is above 25, and 59 is below 64.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 yes, because x starts at 28, and ends at ~59 which is less than 60.\n\nSo both options C and D include the x range. But which one is correct?\n\nWait, the correct range is 28 <x <~59.03. So option D says 28 <x <60. That's correct because 59.03 is less than 60. So D is correct.\n\nOption C says 25 <x <64. Which is also correct, because x is between 28 and 59, which is within 25 and 64.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"satisfies\" one of the options. So if both options C and D are correct, but the options don't have overlapping ranges, which one is correct?\n\nWait, looking back at the options:\n\nOption D is 28 <x <60.\n\nOption C is 25 <x <64.\n\nSince the correct x is between 28 and ~59.03, both C and D would include this range. But let me double-check.\n\nWait, no. Because D's lower bound is 28, which matches the minimum x. C's lower bound is 25, which is below the minimum x of 28. So x is above 28, so C is correct because 25 <28, and x is up to 59 which is less than 64. So C is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the x is 28 when n=36, and as n increases, x increases. So the minimum x is 28, maximum is ~59. So the x must be greater than 28 and less than 59.03. So the correct option must have a lower bound below 28 and upper bound above 59.03.\n\nLooking again, option C is 25 <x <64. So 25 is below 28, 64 is above 59, so x is within 25 and 64. So x satisfies 25 <x <64.\n\nOption D is 28 <x <60. So 28 is the minimum, and 60 is above 59.03, so x is within 28 and 60. So both C and D are possible?\n\nWait, but wait. The x can't be less than 28. So the correct range is x >28 and x <~59.03. So any option that includes this range is correct.\n\nSo options C and D both include this range. But the question is asking which option x satisfies. So perhaps I made a mistake in my simplification.\n\nWait, let me recheck the substitution. When I let t=\u221an, and simplified x to t\u00b2-2t +4, which is n -2\u221an +4. So for n=36, x=36-12+4=28. For n=72, x=72-2*(6\u221a2)+4=76 -12\u221a2\u224876-16.97=59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to ~59.03.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60. So 59.03 is less than 60, so x is in 28 <x <60. So D is correct.\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64. x is between 28 and 59.03, so this is also correct.\n\nWait, but the problem is a multiple-choice question. So which option is correct? If both C and D include the correct range, but the options are exclusive, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me check the calculation for x again.\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16]/[n +4\u221an +4]\n\nWe did a substitution t=\u221an, leading to x = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nWait, let me recheck that. When I did the substitution, I had:\n\nNumerator: t^4 + 2t(t^2 +4) +16 = t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nDenominator: (t+2)^2.\n\nFactoring numerator, we found it factors as (t+2)^2 (t^2 - 2t +4). So x becomes (t^2 -2t +4). So yes, x = t^2 -2t +4 = (\u221an)^2 -2\u221an +4 =n -2\u221an +4.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo for n=36, x=36-12+4=28.\n\nn=72: x=72-2*6\u221a2 +4=76-12\u221a2\u224876-16.97\u224859.03.\n\nSo the x is between 28 and ~59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 yes.\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 also yes.\n\nBut the problem is that both options C and D include the x range. But perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the numerator simplification.\n\nWait, the numerator after substitution was t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16, which we factored as (t+2)^2 (t^2-2t+4).\n\nLet me multiply (t+2)^2 by (t^2 -2t +4) to make sure.\n\n(t+2)^2 = t\u00b2 +4t +4.\n\nMultiply by (t\u00b2 -2t +4):\n\n(t\u00b2)(t\u00b2-2t+4) = t^4 -2t^3 +4t\u00b2.\n\n(4t)(t\u00b2-2t+4) =4t^3 -8t\u00b2 +16t.\n\n(4)(t\u00b2-2t+4)=4t\u00b2 -8t +16.\n\nAdding all together:\n\nt^4 -2t^3 +4t\u00b2 +4t^3 -8t\u00b2 +16t +4t\u00b2 -8t +16.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nt^4: 1.\n\nt^3: (-2t^3 +4t^3)=2t^3.\n\nt^2: (4t\u00b2 -8t\u00b2 +4t\u00b2) =0.\n\nt terms: (16t -8t)=8t.\n\nConstants: +16.\n\nSo the product is t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16, which matches the numerator. So the factoring is correct.\n\nSo x is correctly simplified to t^2 -2t +4, which is n -2\u221an +4.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to ~59.03.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 yes, because 59.03 is less than 60.\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 also yes, because 59.03 is less than 64.\n\nSo both options C and D include the x range. But the options are supposed to be exclusive.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me recheck the substitution.\n\nWait, the original equation is x = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16]/[n +4\u221an +4].\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute x for n=36 and n=72 again.\n\nn=36:\n\nx = (36\u00b2 + 2\u221a36*(36+4) +16) / (36 +4\u221a36 +4).\n\nCompute numerator: 36\u00b2=1296.\n\n2\u221a36*(36+4) =2*6*(40)=12*40=480.\n\n16.\n\nTotal numerator:1296 +480 +16 = 1792.\n\nDenominator:36 +4*6 +4 =36 +24 +4=64.\n\nSo x=1792 /64=28. Correct.\n\nn=72:\n\nNumerator:72\u00b2 + 2\u221a72*(72+4) +16.\n\n72\u00b2=5184.\n\n\u221a72=6\u221a2.\n\n2\u221a72*(76) =2*6\u221a2 *76=12\u221a2*76=912\u221a2.\n\n16.\n\nSo numerator=5184 +912\u221a2 +16=5200 +912\u221a2.\n\nDenominator:72 +4\u221a72 +4 =76 +4*6\u221a2 =76 +24\u221a2.\n\nSo x=(5200 +912\u221a2)/(76 +24\u221a2).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor numerator and denominator.\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:5200 +912\u221a2 = let's see, 5200= 76 * 68.421... Not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor out 8:\n\n5200=8*650, 912=8*114.\n\nSo 5200 +912\u221a2=8*(650 +114\u221a2).\n\nDenominator:76 +24\u221a2=4*(19 +6\u221a2).\n\nWait, 76=4*19, 24\u221a2=4*6\u221a2. So denominator=4*(19 +6\u221a2).\n\nSo x= [8*(650 +114\u221a2)] / [4*(19 +6\u221a2)] = 2*(650 +114\u221a2)/(19 +6\u221a2).\n\nLet me compute (650 +114\u221a2)/(19 +6\u221a2).\n\nLet me rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by (19 -6\u221a2):\n\n[(650 +114\u221a2)(19 -6\u221a2)] / [(19)^2 - (6\u221a2)^2].\n\nCompute denominator: 361 - (36 *2) =361 -72=289.\n\nNumerator: Let me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, 650 *19 = 12350.\n\n650*(-6\u221a2)= -3900\u221a2.\n\n114\u221a2 *19= 2166\u221a2.\n\n114\u221a2*(-6\u221a2) = -684*(\u221a2)^2= -684*2= -1368.\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\n12350 -3900\u221a2 +2166\u221a2 -1368.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nConstants:12350 -1368 =10982.\n\n\u221a2 terms: (-3900 +2166)\u221a2= (-1734)\u221a2.\n\nSo numerator: 10982 -1734\u221a2.\n\nDenominator:289.\n\nSo x=2*(10982 -1734\u221a2)/289.\n\nCompute 10982 /289: 289 *38=10982 (because 289 *30=8670, 289 *8=2312; 8670+2312=10982).\n\nSo 10982 /289=38.\n\nSimilarly, 1734 /289: 289 *6=1734.\n\nSo numerator becomes 38 -6\u221a2.\n\nSo x=2*(38 -6\u221a2)=76 -12\u221a2.\n\nWhich is the same as before, approximately 76 -16.97\u224859.03.\n\nSo x is 76 -12\u221a2, which is exactly around 59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nSo the correct options would be those that include this interval.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. Since 59.03 <60, this is correct.\n\nOption C says 25 <x <64. 28 is above 25, 59.03 is below 64. So this is also correct.\n\nHmm, but the options are supposed to have only one correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification.\n\nWait, perhaps the function x is not strictly increasing. Let me check for n between 36 and72.\n\nWe have x =n -2\u221an +4. Let me compute the derivative dx/dn =1 - (2/(2\u221an)) )=1 - (1/\u221an).\n\nAt n=36: 1 -1/6 \u22480.833>0.\n\nAt n=72:1 -1/(sqrt(72))=1 -1/(6\u221a2)=1 -1/(8.485)\u22481-0.1178\u22480.882>0.\n\nSo derivative is positive throughout the interval, so x increases as n increases. So x is between 28 and ~59.03.\n\nSo the x is strictly between 28 and ~59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D:28 <x <60 \u2192 correct, as 59.03 is less than 60.\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 also correct, but the lower bound is lower than the actual minimum.\n\nBut the question is about which option x satisfies. So both C and D are correct? But that can't be, as it's a multiple-choice question.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification. Let me re-examine the initial equation.\n\nWait, the initial equation is x = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16 ] / [n +4\u221an +4].\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute x for n=36 and n=72 again.\n\nn=36:\n\nNumerator:36\u00b2 +2*6*(36+4) +16=1296 +2*6*40 +16=1296 +480 +16=1792.\n\nDenominator:36 +4*6 +4=36+24+4=64.\n\nx=1792/64=28. Correct.\n\nn=72:\n\nNumerator:72\u00b2=5184.\n\n2\u221a72*(72+4)=2*6\u221a2 *76=12\u221a2*76=912\u221a2.\n\n16.\n\nSo numerator=5184 +912\u221a2 +16=5200 +912\u221a2.\n\nDenominator=72 +4*6\u221a2 +4=76 +24\u221a2.\n\nSo x=(5200 +912\u221a2)/(76 +24\u221a2).\n\nLet me compute this fraction.\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 5200 +912\u221a2 = 8*(650 + 114\u221a2).\n\nDenominator:76 +24\u221a2=4*(19 +6\u221a2).\n\nSo x= [8*(650 +114\u221a2)] / [4*(19 +6\u221a2)] = 2*(650 +114\u221a2)/(19 +6\u221a2).\n\nNow, let me compute (650 +114\u221a2)/(19 +6\u221a2).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (19 -6\u221a2):\n\nNumerator: (650 +114\u221a2)(19 -6\u221a2).\n\nDenominator: (19)^2 - (6\u221a2)^2 =361 -72=289.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n650*19=12350.\n\n650*(-6\u221a2)= -3900\u221a2.\n\n114\u221a2 *19=2166\u221a2.\n\n114\u221a2*(-6\u221a2)= -114*6*2= -1368.\n\nSo adding terms:\n\n12350 -3900\u221a2 +2166\u221a2 -1368.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n12350 -1368 =10982.\n\n(-3900\u221a2 +2166\u221a2)= -1734\u221a2.\n\nSo numerator=10982 -1734\u221a2.\n\nDenominator=289.\n\nSo x=2*(10982 -1734\u221a2)/289.\n\nCompute 10982/289=38, since 289*38=10982.\n\n1734/289=6, because 289*6=1734.\n\nSo x=2*(38 -6\u221a2) =76 -12\u221a2.\n\nWhich is approximately 76 -12*1.4142=76 -16.9704=59.0296.\n\nSo x=76-12\u221a2\u224859.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 no.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 no, since x can be up to ~59, which is over 58.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, 28 is above 25, and ~59 is below 64.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 yes, 28 is the lower bound, and ~59 is below 60.\n\nSo both C and D are correct, but the options are presented as multiple-choice, so perhaps I made a mistake in the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the exact value of x.\n\nx=76 -12\u221a2.\n\nCompute 12\u221a2 exactly: \u221a2\u22481.41421356.\n\n12*1.41421356\u224816.9705827.\n\nSo 76-16.9705827\u224859.0294173.\n\nSo x= approximately59.03.\n\nSo x is between 28 and 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options, D says 28 <x <60, which includes up to 60, which is more than 59.03. So D is correct.\n\nOption C says 25 <x <64, which also includes the range. But D is more precise.\n\nWait, but the options are presented as the correct range that x must satisfy. So the correct answer would be the one that x is between 28 and 59.03.\n\nSo option D is 28 <x <60, which is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check another point. Let me pick n=49, which is in the range.\n\nn=49.\n\nx=49 -2*7 +4=49-14+4=39.\n\nSo x=39, which is within option D's range (28 <39 <60), and also within option C's range (25 <39 <64).\n\nSo both options C and D are correct.\n\nBut the options are given as multiple-choice, so perhaps the intended answer is D, because it's more specific.\n\nWait, but let me look at the options again:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 no.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 no.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 yes.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 yes.\n\nE)None of these.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"satisfies\" one of these options. If both C and D are correct, then perhaps E is not the answer. But wait, the options are presented as choices, so perhaps only one is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute x for n=36 and n=72 again.\n\nWait, for n=36, x=28. So x is exactly 28. So the lower bound is 28, not greater than. So for option D, it's 28 <x <60. But x can be equal to 28, so the correct option should have x \u226528, but the options are inequalities, not including equality.\n\nWait, the question says \"satisfies\", so perhaps the correct option is the one where x is strictly greater than 28 and less than 60. So option D is 28 <x <60.\n\nBut when n=36, x=28. So x can be equal to 28. So if the option is \"28 <x <60\", then x=28 is not included, which is incorrect because x can be 28.\n\nWait, but when n=36, x=28. So the range is x \u226528 and x \u226459.03. So the correct option would be one that includes x=28 and up to ~59.03.\n\nLooking at the options, none of the options include 28 as a possible x. Because all options have lower bounds less than 28 or higher, but the upper bounds may vary.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 x=28 is in this range.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 x=28 is in this range.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 x=28 is in this range.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 x=28 is not in this range, since it's strictly greater than 28.\n\nSo when n=36, x=28. So the correct option must include x=28.\n\nThus, option D is incorrect because it excludes x=28. So the correct answer must be an option that includes 28 as a possible value.\n\nLooking back, option C:25 <x <64 includes x=28. Option D excludes x=28.\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that x starts at 28 and goes up to ~59.03. So the correct x must be \u226528 and \u226459.03. So the correct option must include 28 and up.\n\nLooking at the options, only option C includes 28, as it's from 25 to64.\n\nBut option D is 28 <x <60, which excludes x=28.\n\nThus, the correct answer would be C, because when n=36, x=28 is included in the range.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that x increases from 28 to ~59.03, so x can be 28 and up to 59.03.\n\nSo the range is 28 \u2264x <59.03.\n\nLooking at the options, which one includes this range.\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, because 28 is within 25 to64.\n\nOption D:28 <x <60 \u2192 no, because x can be 28, but D's lower bound is x>28.\n\nThus, the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. The problem says \"satisfies\", which I think refers to the x being in that interval for all n in 36\u2264n\u226472.\n\nWait, no, it's for a given n in that range, x is in which interval.\n\nSo for each n, x is between 28 and ~59.03. So the correct interval is 28\u2264x\u226459.03.\n\nLooking for the option that includes this interval.\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, 28 is within 25, and 59 is within 64.\n\nOption D:28 <x <60 \u2192 x=28 is not included.\n\nSo the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that x is 28 when n=36, and increases to ~59. So x can be 28, so the correct option must include 28.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C, because it includes 28.\n\nBut looking back at the options, the question is phrased as \"x satisfies\".\n\nIf the options are:\n\nA)20 <x <54\n\nB)23 <x <58\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nE)None of these.\n\nSince x can be as low as 28 and as high as ~59.03, the correct option is C, because 25 <28 and 59.03 <64. So x is within 25 and64.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again: x is between 28 and ~59.03. So option C is 25 <x <64. So x is within this range. So the correct answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, if the options don't include an option that starts at 28, then E might be the answer.\n\nWait, but option C includes the entire range of x, so the correct answer is C.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought x starts at 28, I thought option D was correct, but since x can be exactly 28, option D (which starts at x>28) is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer is C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the given equation:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Denominator\nThe denominator is \\( n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4 \\), which can be rewritten as \\( (\\sqrt{n} + 2)^2 \\). This simplifies the equation to:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{(\\sqrt{n} + 2)^2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Numerator\nThe numerator is \\( n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 \\). Expanding and simplifying:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 = n^2 + 2n\\sqrt{n} + 8\\sqrt{n} + 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor the Numerator\nThe numerator can be factored as:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 2n\\sqrt{n} + 8\\sqrt{n} + 16 = (\\sqrt{n} + 2)^2(n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4)\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the Entire Expression\nSubstituting the factored numerator and the simplified denominator into the equation for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(\\sqrt{n} + 2)^2(n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4)}{(\\sqrt{n} + 2)^2} = n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( x = n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Range of \\( x \\)\nGiven \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\), we calculate \\( x \\) at the endpoints:\n\n1. **At \\( n = 36 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = 36 - 2\\sqrt{36} + 4 = 36 - 12 + 4 = 28\n   \\]\n\n2. **At \\( n = 72 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = 72 - 2\\sqrt{72} + 4 = 72 - 2(6\\sqrt{2}) + 4 = 76 - 12\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n   Approximating \\( \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414 \\):\n   \\[\n   x \\approx 76 - 12(1.414) = 76 - 16.97 = 59.03\n   \\]\n\nThus, \\( x \\) ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\n### Step 6: Analyze the Options\nThe options are:\n\n- **A)** \\( 20 < x < 54 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x \\) can exceed 54.\n- **B)** \\( 23 < x < 58 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x \\) can exceed 58.\n- **C)** \\( 25 < x < 64 \\): Correct, as \\( x \\) ranges from 28 to 59.03, which is entirely within this interval.\n- **D)** \\( 28 < x < 60 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x = 28 \\) is not included in this range.\n- **E)** None of these: Incorrect, as option C is valid.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct option is **C**, as it fully encompasses the range of \\( x \\).\n\nAnswer: C",
