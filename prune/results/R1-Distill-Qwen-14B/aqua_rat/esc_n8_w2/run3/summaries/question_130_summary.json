      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about an astronaut's weight on Venus compared to Earth. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.\n\nThe question says the astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth and 182 pounds on Venus. They want to know what percent the Venus weight is of the Earth weight. So, percentage-wise, 182 is what percent of 211.\n\nWait, I remember that to find a percentage, you take the part divided by the whole, then multiply by 100. So in this case, the part is Venus weight, and the whole is Earth weight. So the formula would be (182 / 211) * 100.\n\nLet me calculate that. Let's see, 182 divided by 211. Hmm, I can approximate this. Maybe I should do the division step by step. \n\nWait, 211 times 0.8 is 168.8, because 200*0.8 is 160, and 11*0.8 is 8.8. So 160+8.8=168.8. That's less than 182. What about 0.85 times 211? Let's see, 200*0.85 is 170, and 11*0.85 is 9.35, so 170+9.35=179.35. Oh, that's close to 182. So 0.85 would give around 179, but our value is 182, which is a bit higher. So maybe the percentage is a little over 85%.\n\nWait, let's compute it more accurately. 182 divided by 211.\n\nLet me try 182 / 211. Let's see, 211 goes into 182 zero times. So we add a decimal point and zeros. 211 into 1820. How many times does 211 go into 1820? Let's see, 211 * 8 is 1688. Subtract that from 1820: 1820-1688=132. Bring down a zero, making it 1320.\n\n211 goes into 1320 how many times? Let's see, 211*6 is 1266. Subtract, 1320-1266=54. Bring down a zero to make 540.\n\n211 goes into 540 twice (2*211=422). Subtract: 540-422=118. Bring down a zero, making 1180.\n\n211*5=1055. Subtract: 1180-1055=125. Bring down a zero, making 1250.\n\n211*5=1055 again. Wait, 211*5 is 1055. 1250-1055=195. Bring down a zero, making 1950.\n\n211*9=1899. Subtract: 1950-1899=51. Hmm, I can see this is getting a bit lengthy, but so far the decimal is 0.8625... So approximately 86.25%.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 86%, which is the closest. So the answer should be D.\n",

The question is asking what percent the Venus weight is of the Earth weight. \n\nSo, the astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth and 182 pounds on Venus. I remember that weight depends on gravity. Each planet has its own gravitational pull. On Earth, we're used to 1g, right? But what about Venus?\n\nWait, I think Venus's gravity is less than Earth's. Oh wait, no, wait. No, wait, I think Venus actually has a gravity that's about 90% of Earth's. Because I remember that on Mars, it's about 38%, so lighter. But Venus is closer to Earth's. So if the astronaut weighs 182 pounds on Venus, which is less than Earth's 211, that makes sense because Venus's gravity is a bit less. \n\nSo the question is asking for the percentage. So the formula for percentage would be (Venus weight / Earth weight) * 100. Let me calculate that. \n\nSo 182 divided by 211. Let me do that division. Hmm, 211 is the denominator. Let's see, 211 times 0.8 is 168.8. Wait, 0.8 is 80%, but 182 is higher than that. 211 times 0.86 is... 211 * 0.8 is 168.8, 211 * 0.06 is 12.66. So 168.8 +12.66 is 181.46. Oh, that's really close to 182. So 0.86 times 211 is approximately 181.46, which is almost 182. So the percentage is about 86%. \n\nLooking at the options, option D is 86%, so that must be the answer. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculation. Let me compute 182 divided by 211. Let's see, 211 goes into 182 how many times? Well, 211 is larger than 182, so it's less than 1. So I can write it as 182/211. Let me calculate that. \n\nWell, 211 divided by 182 is about 1.16, but I need 182/211. So 182 \u00f7 211. Let me think, 211 is approximately 200. 182 is 90% of 202.222 (because 202.222 * 0.9 is about 182). But that's maybe not the right way. Alternatively, I can compute it as a decimal. \n\n182 \u00f7 211. Let's set it up: 182.000 divided by 211.\n\n211 goes into 182 zero times. So we write it as 0. and proceed. 211 goes into 1820 how many times? 211 * 8 is 1688, which is less than 1820. 211 *9 is 1899, which is too much. So 8 times. 8 *211 is 1688. Subtract from 1820: 1820 - 1688 = 132. Bring down a zero: 1320.\n\n211 goes into 1320 how many times? 211 *6=1266. That's under 1320. 211 *6=1266, subtract from 1320: 54. Bring down next zero: 540.\n\n211 goes into 540 twice (2*211=422). 540-422=118. Bring down zero: 1180.\n\n211 goes into 1180 five times (5*211=1055). 1180-1055=125. Bring down zero: 1250.\n\n211 goes into 1250 five times (5*211=1055). 1250-1055=195. Bring down zero: 1950.\n\n211 *9=1899. 1950-1899=51. So so far, we've got 0.865... and so on.\n\nWait, so the division is approximately 0.865, which is 86.5%. So that rounds to 87%, but the options given are 86% as option D and 90% as E.
