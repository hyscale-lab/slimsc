      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about friends going on a picnic and some money calculations. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nThe problem says that a group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. But then, four of them didn't show up. Because of that, the remaining people had to contribute Rs. 4 more each. I need to find out how many attended the picnic.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. Let's assume the original number of friends was N. So, they all were supposed to split the Rs. 96. But when four didn't come, the number of attendees became N-4. \n\nOriginally, each person was going to pay 96/N rupees. But after four left, each person had to pay 4 rupees more. So the new amount per person is (96/N) + 4.\n\nWait, but also, the total amount is still 96, right? Because the total cost didn't change, only the number of people sharing it. So the new per-person contribution multiplied by the number of attendees should equal 96.\n\nSo mathematically, I can write this as:\n\n(Number of attendees) * (New contribution per person) = 96\n\nWhich is (N-4) * [(96/N) +4] =96.\n\nHmm, let me set that equation up correctly.\n\nLet me write N as the original number of friends. So the original share per person is 96/N. When four are missing, the new share is 96/(N-4). Wait, wait a minute, maybe I should think about it that way. Because when four don't come, the remaining (N-4) people have to cover the total amount, so each pays 96/(N-4). But the problem says that this new amount is Rs. 4 more than the original share.\n\nWait, the original share was 96/N. The new share is 96/(N-4). And the new share is equal to original share plus 4.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n96/(N-4) = (96/N) + 4.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So that's the equation I need to solve for N.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n96/(N-4) = 96/N +4.\n\nHmm, solving for N. Let's rearrange this equation. Maybe bring everything to one side.\n\nMultiply both sides by N*(N-4) to eliminate the denominators.\n\nSo:\n\n96*N = 96*(N-4) +4*N*(N-4).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nLeft side: 96N.\n\nRight side: 96(N-4) +4N(N-4).\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n96N - 384 +4N\u00b2 -16N.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n96N -16N is 80N.\n\nSo right side becomes 4N\u00b2 +80N -384.\n\nSo equation now is:\n\n96N = 4N\u00b2 +80N -384.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n96N -4N\u00b2 -80N +384 =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(96N -80N) is 16N.\n\nSo, -4N\u00b2 +16N +384=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make the quadratic coefficient positive:\n\n4N\u00b2 -16N -384=0.\n\nDivide all terms by 4 to simplify:\n\nN\u00b2 -4N -96=0.\n\nNow, solving the quadratic equation N\u00b2 -4N -96 =0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula: N = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 384)] / 2.\n\nBecause sqrt(16 + 384) is sqrt(400)=20.\n\nSo N = [4 \u00b120]/2.\n\nWe have two solutions:\n\n(4+20)/2=24/2=12.\n\n(4-20)/2= (-16)/2=-8.\n\nSince N can't be negative, N=12.\n\nWait, so the original number of friends was 12. But the question is asking for the number of those who attended, which is N-4.\n\nSo N-4 is 12-4=8.\n\nWait, so the number of attendees is 8. Let me check the options. Option A is 8. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the equation. When N=12, the original share is 96/12=8 Rs per person. Four didn't come, so attendees are 8. Each now has to pay 96/8=12 Rs. 12 is 4 more than 8. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the calculation seems right. So the number who attended is 8, which is option A.\n",

Because of that, the remaining friends had to each contribute Rs. 4 extra. I need to find out how many of them actually attended the picnic.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember these kinds of problems usually involve setting up equations based on the information given.\n\nLet's denote the number of friends who attended as x. Originally, they all planned to contribute equally, right? So if all of them were present, each would have paid 96 divided by the total number of friends. But wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute, the problem says four didn't turn up, so the total number of friends is x + 4. Because x attended, and four didn't, so total is x +4.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me clarify that. If x is the number who attended, then the number who didn't come is 4. So the original number of friends planning was x +4.\n\nSo initially, each was supposed to pay 96 divided by (x +4). But since four didn't come, the number of people paying is x. So each of them now has to pay 96 divided by x.\n\nThe problem says that because four didn't come, each of the remaining had to contribute Rs.4 extra. So the amount each person pays now is Rs.4 more than what they planned.\n\nSo, mathematically, that would be:\n\n(96 / x) = (96 / (x +4)) + 4\n\nYes, that makes sense. So I can set up this equation and solve for x.\n\nLet me write that equation again:\n\n96/x = 96/(x+4) +4\n\nI need to solve for x. Let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, subtract 96/(x+4) from both sides:\n\n96/x - 96/(x+4) =4\n\nI can combine these two fractions. Let's find a common denominator, which would be x*(x+4).\n\nSo,\n\n[96*(x+4) -96*x ] / [x*(x+4)] =4\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n96x + 384 -96x =384\n\nSo now we have:\n\n384 / [x*(x+4)] =4\n\nMultiply both sides by x*(x+4):\n\n384 =4*x*(x+4)\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n96 = x*(x+4)\n\nSo now, the equation is:\n\nx\u00b2 +4x -96=0\n\nWait, wait. Wait, 96 is positive on the right, so when I bring it to the left, it becomes negative. So yes, x\u00b2 +4x -96=0.\n\nNow, let's solve this quadratic equation. The quadratic is x\u00b2 +4x -96=0.\n\nI can try factoring. Let's see if I can find two numbers that multiply to -96 and add to 4.\n\nLet me think: factors of 96 are 1 &96, 2&48, 3&32, 4&24, 6&16, 8&12.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -96 and add to 4. So one is positive, the other negative.\n\nLet's see: 12 and -8: 12*(-8) =-96. 12 + (-8)=4. Yes, that works.\n\nSo the equation factors as:\n\n(x +12)(x -8)=0\n\nSo the solutions are x=-12 or x=8. But since the number of people can't be negative, x=8 is the solution.\n\nSo the number of friends who attended is 8.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nOriginal equation: 96/x =96/(x+4) +4.\n\nSubtracting 96/(x+4) from both sides: 96/x -96/(x+4) =4.\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n[96(x+4) -96x]/(x(x+4)) =4.\n\nNumerator: 96x + 384 -96x =384. So 384/(x(x+4))=4.\n\nMultiply both sides by x(x+4): 384=4x(x+4).\n\nDivide by 4: 96= x(x+4).\n\nSo x\u00b2 +4x -96=0.\n\nFactored into (x+12)(x-8)=0, so x=8.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the number of attendees is 8, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the answer is correct by plugging it back into the original problem.\n\nIf 8 attended, then total friends were 12 (since 8+4=12).\n\nOriginally, each would pay 96/12=8 Rs.\n\nBut since 4 didn't come, each of the 8 pays 96/8=12 Rs.\n\nSo each pays 4 Rs. more (12-8=4), which matches the problem statement.\n\nYes, that's correct.

The planned contribution per person was \\( \\frac{96}{x + 4} \\). However, with four friends absent, the contribution per person became \\( \\frac{96}{x} \\). According to the problem, this new contribution was Rs. 4 extra per person. Thus, the equation can be set up as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{96}{x} = \\frac{96}{x + 4} + 4\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\( \\frac{96}{x + 4} \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{96}{x} - \\frac{96}{x + 4} = 4\n\\]\n\nFinding a common denominator \\( x(x + 4) \\) and simplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{96(x + 4) - 96x}{x(x + 4)} = 4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the numerator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{384}{x(x + 4)} = 4\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( x(x + 4) \\):\n\n\\[\n384 = 4x(x + 4)\n\\]\n\nDividing by 4:\n\n\\[\n96 = x(x + 4)\n\\]\n\nRewriting as a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 4x - 96 = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring:\n\n\\[\n(x + 12)(x - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThe solutions are \\( x = -12 \\) or \\( x = 8 \\). Since the number of attendees cannot be negative, \\( x = 8 \\). Verifying, if 8 attended, the total number of friends was \\( 12 \\). Originally, each would pay \\( \\frac{96}{12} = 8 \\) Rs., but with 4 absent, each paid \\( \\frac{96}{8} = 12 \\) Rs., which is Rs. 4 extra per person, confirming the solution.\n\nThe number of friends who attended the picnic was **8**.\n\nAnswer: A",
