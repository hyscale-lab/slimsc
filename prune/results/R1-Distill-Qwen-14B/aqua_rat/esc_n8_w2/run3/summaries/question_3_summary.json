      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is. The question is asking which of the given options is a multiple of X, and that X is divisible by both 9 and 12. Hmm, wait, I need to make sure I understand the question correctly. So, X is a number that's divisible by 9 and 12, and we're looking for which of the options is a multiple of that X. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says, \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" Oh wait, no, maybe I got it wrong. Let me parse it again. So, the value (which is one of the options) is a multiple of X, and X is divisible by 9 and 12. Or perhaps it's that X is the multiple, and the options are the numbers which are multiples of X? Wait, no, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me try to rephrase.\n\nThe question is phrased as: Which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by 9 and 12. So, X is a number that's a multiple of both 9 and 12. So, X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. But then, we're looking for which of the options is a multiple of X. Wait, that's a bit tricky.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again. The question says, \"if it is divisible by 9 and 12.\" So, perhaps the value (the options) must be divisible by both 9 and 12, making it a multiple of their least common multiple (LCM). Alternatively, perhaps X is a number that is a multiple of both 9 and 12, and the options are numbers that are multiples of X. Hmm, that's possible.\n\nWait, let me think in terms of the problem. Let's break it down. The question is: Which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\n\nSo, the options are numbers, and each option is a possible value. The condition is that it (the option) is a multiple of X, and X is divisible by 9 and 12. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the correct way is that the value (the option) is a multiple of X, and X is itself divisible by 9 and 12. So, X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12, but the options are the multiples of X.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd because the options given are 36, 15,17,5,7. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the value (the option) is divisible by both 9 and 12, and thus it must be a multiple of the LCM of 9 and 12, which is 36. So, the correct option is 36, which is option A.\n\nWait, let me think through that. So, if a number is divisible by both 9 and 12, then it must be divisible by their LCM. Let's calculate the LCM of 9 and 12. 9 is 3^2, and 12 is 2^2 *3. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present, so 2^2 *3^2 = 4*9=36. So, the LCM is 36. So, any number divisible by both 9 and 12 must be a multiple of 36.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 36, which is exactly the LCM. So, 36 is a multiple of 36, so it's a multiple of X (where X is 36). The other options are 15,17,5,7, which are not multiples of 36. So, the correct answer should be A)36.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The question says, \"which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12.\" So, the 'it' refers to X. So, X is divisible by 9 and 12, so X is a common multiple of 9 and 12. Now, the options are possible multiples of X. So, the options are numbers that are multiples of X. So, which of these numbers is a multiple of X, where X is a common multiple of 9 and 12.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because if X is a common multiple, it's already larger than or equal to the LCM. The options are 36,15, etc. Let me think again. For example, if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (since 36 = 1 * X), but the other options like 15 would be smaller than X, so they can't be multiples of X. Wait, but 36 is the LCM, so X could be 36, 72, 108, etc. But the options given are all much smaller. So, perhaps the question is phrased differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that the options are the values of X, which are multiples of X (wait, that doesn't make sense). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the question is: Which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by both 9 and 12. So, X is a number that's a multiple of both 9 and 12, and the options are numbers that are multiples of X. So, the options must be multiples of X, which itself is a multiple of 36. But the options are 36, 15,17,5,7. So, let's see:\n\nIf X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (since 36 = 1 * X), so option A would be correct.\n\nIf X is 72, then none of the options (since 72 is larger than all the options except 36, but 36 isn't a multiple of 72). So, the only option that is a multiple of X (if X is 36) is 36 itself.\n\nWait, but X could be any multiple of 36. So, for X=36, 36 is a multiple. For X=72, 36 is not a multiple of 72, so it wouldn't be. But since the options are fixed, the only option that is a multiple of X (where X is a multiple of 36) is 36 itself. Because any X would be 36, 72, 108, etc. So, the only option that is a multiple of any X is 36. Because, for example, if X is 36, 36 is a multiple. If X is 72, 36 is not a multiple. So, how can one of the options be a multiple of X for any X divisible by 9 and 12?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it another way. The question is to find which of the options is a multiple of X, where X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. So, X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. The LCM of 9 and 12 is 36, so X must be a multiple of 36. So, X can be 36, 72, 108, etc.\n\nNow, the options are numbers that are multiples of X. So, the options must be multiples of X, which is a multiple of 36. So, for each option, we need to see if it's a multiple of X, which is a multiple of 36.\n\nWait, but if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (since 36 = 1 * X). So, option A is a multiple of X when X is 36. For X=72, 36 is not a multiple of 72. So, in that case, option A is not a multiple of X.\n\nSo, how can the question be phrased such that the correct option is the one that's a multiple of X (which is a multiple of 36)? Because X could be any multiple of 36. So, the only option that is a multiple of X for any X is 36 itself, because 36 is the smallest multiple of 36. Let me see:\n\nIf X is 36, then 36 is a multiple (36 *1). If X is 72, then 36 is not a multiple of 72. So, the only time 36 is a multiple of X is when X is 36. But if X is a larger multiple, then 36 isn't a multiple. So, perhaps the question is looking for the option that is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by both 9 and 12. But since X can be any multiple of 36, the only option that can be a multiple of X is 36 itself, because 36 is the LCM, and any larger X would make the options smaller than X, thus not multiples.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, 36 is an option, and 36 is a multiple of X (if X is 36). So, perhaps that's why 36 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question entirely. Maybe the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X, and X is a number that's divisible by 9 and 12. So, X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12, and the options are possible multiples of X.\n\nIn that case, the options must be multiples of X. But X is a multiple of 36. So, the options must be multiples of 36. Looking at the options, only 36 is a multiple of 36. The others (15,17,5,7) are not. So, option A is 36, which is a multiple of X (since X is 36).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the correct answer is A)36.\n",

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So that would be 2^2 * 3^2 = 4 *9=36. So the LCM is 36. So X must be a multiple of 36.

If X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (36 is 1*36). But wait, the question is phrased as \"which of the following is a multiple of X\", which would mean that X must divide the option. So if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (36=1*36). But wait, that's confusing because X is 36, so the multiple would be 36 itself.

So which of these is a multiple of X (which is 36 or higher). So 36 is a multiple of X only if X is 36. Because 36 is 1*36.

Alternatively, maybe the question is saying that X is divisible by 9 and 12, so X must be a common multiple of those two. So the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12 is needed because X is a multiple of both. So first, let me calculate the LCM of 9 and 12.\n\n9 factors into 3^2, and 12 factors into 2^2 * 3^1. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So that would be 2^2 * 3^2 = 4 *9=36. So the LCM is 36. So X must be a multiple of 36. Wait, but the question is, which of the options is a multiple of X. Oh wait, no, the question says, \"which of the following values is the multiple of X\", meaning the options are possible X's, and we need to find which X is a multiple of both 9 and 12, i.e., which option is a multiple of both 9 and 12. Wait, no, the question wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the question wrong. Let me read it again: \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" So it's saying that if X is divisible by both 9 and 12, then which of the options is a multiple of X. So the options are the possible multiples of X. But X is a number that is itself a multiple of 9 and 12. So X could be 36, 72, etc. So the options are numbers, and we need to find which is a multiple of X. But if X is a multiple of 36, then the options must be multiples of X, which would be larger than or equal to X. But looking at the options, they are 36,15,17,5,7. So 36 is an option. If X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (36 is 1*36). But wait, the question is phrased as \"which of the following is a multiple of X\", which would mean that X must divide the option. So if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (36=1*36). But wait, that's confusing because X is 36, so the multiple would be 36 itself. But perhaps the options are the possible X's, and we're to choose which X is a multiple of both 9 and 12. Wait, but the question says \"if it is divisible by 9 and 12\" \u2014 the \"it\" refers to X. So X is divisible by 9 and 12, so X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. So the options are possible X's, and we need to choose which is a multiple of both 9 and 12. So the LCM of 9 and 12 is 36, so X must be a multiple of 36. So looking at the options, option A is 36. So 36 is a multiple of itself, so it's a possible X.\n\nBut wait, the question is phrased as \"which of the following is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12.\" Hmm, perhaps I've misread the question. Maybe it's saying that the value (the option) must be a multiple of X, and X is divisible by 9 and 12. So X is a number that is a multiple of 9 and 12, and the options are possible multiples of X. So which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is a multiple of 36 (since LCM of 9 and 12 is 36). So X must be 36, 72, 108, etc. Now, the options are 36,15,17,5,7. So which of these is a multiple of X (which is 36 or higher). So 36 is a multiple of X only if X is 36. Because 36 is 1*36. But if X is 72, then none of the options are multiples of 72 because all options are smaller. So the only option that could be a multiple of X is 36, where X is 36. Because if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X. So the correct answer is option A) 36.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is the other way around: which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is a number that is itself a multiple of both 9 and 12. So X must be a multiple of 36. So the options are 36,15,17,5,7. The only option that is a multiple of 36 is 36 itself. Because 36 is 36*1. So 36 is a multiple of X=36. So option A is correct.\n\n\nTo determine which of the given values is a multiple of \\( X \\), where \\( X \\) is divisible by both 9 and 12, we first calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12. \n\n- The prime factorization of 9 is \\( 3^2 \\), and the prime factorization of 12 is \\( 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\).\n- The LCM is obtained by taking the highest powers of all prime factors, which gives \\( 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 = 4 \\cdot 9 = 36 \\).\n\nThus, \\( X \\) must be a multiple of 36. The question then asks which of the given options is a multiple of \\( X \\). Since \\( X \\) is a multiple of 36, the only option that satisfies this condition is 36 itself, as it is a multiple of \\( X = 36 \\).\n\nThe other options (15, 17, 5, 7) are smaller than 36 and cannot be multiples of \\( X \\), which is at least 36. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",
