      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the perimeter of a rectangle. The rectangle has a length of 8 centimeters and a width of 3 centimeters. Hmm, I remember that the perimeter is the total distance around the shape. Right, for a rectangle, the formula for perimeter is something like adding up all the sides.\n\nWait, how does the formula go again? Oh right! The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is calculated by adding twice the length and twice the width. So the formula is P = 2*(length + width). Yeah, that sounds right because a rectangle has two sides of each length and width.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. The length is 8 cm, and the width is 3 cm. So, first I add them together: 8 + 3 equals 11. Then I multiply that by 2. So 2 times 11 is 22. Oh wait, so the perimeter would be 22 centimeters. But let me double-check because sometimes I might mix up the formula.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate each side and add them up. The rectangle has two lengths and two widths. So that's 8 + 8 for the lengths, which is 16, and 3 + 3 for the widths, which is 6. Adding those together gives 16 + 6 = 22 cm. Yep, same result. So the perimeter is definitely 22 cm.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 22 cm. So that must be the correct answer.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about finding the perimeter of a rectangle. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the perimeter is the total distance around the shape. For a rectangle, which has two pairs of equal sides, the formula must be something like adding up all the sides.\n\nWait, right, the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. Oh wait, or is it 2*(length + width)? Yeah, I think that's the same thing. So perimeter equals 2*(length + width). That makes sense because each pair of opposite sides is equal.\n\nThe problem gives me the length as 8 centimeters and the width as 3 centimeters. So plugging those numbers into the formula, I should calculate 2*(8 + 3). Let me do that step by step. \n\nFirst, 8 plus 3 is 11. Then multiply that by 2, which gives 22. So the perimeter should be 22 centimeters. Let me double-check the formula to make sure I didn't mix it up. Oh yeah, another way is 2*length + 2*width. So 2*8 is 16, and 2*3 is 6. Adding 16 and 6 together gives 22 again. Okay, so that's consistent.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 22cm. So that must be the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here.
