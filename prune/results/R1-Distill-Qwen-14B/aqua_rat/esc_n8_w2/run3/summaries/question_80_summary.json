      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about population growth in Boomtown. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on exponential growth, but I'll think it through.\n\nThe problem says the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. So, if that happens, the population two years from now will be double what it was one year ago. Wait, wait. Let me make sure I get the timeline right.\n\nLet me assign some variables. Let's say the population right now is P. Oh, wait, the question is asking about the population change over the last year, so I guess the current time is after that past year. Hmm, maybe I should define the population at different times.\n\nWait, the problem says that two years from now, the population would be double the population of one year ago. So, let's parse that. Let me think in terms of time points.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Let P be the population one year ago. So, that's the starting point.\n\n- Next year (one year from now), the population is P plus 10% of P, which is P * 1.10.\n\n- Then, the year after that (two years from now), the population increases another 10%. So, that would be 1.10 times the previous year's population. So, it's 1.10 * (1.10 * P) = (1.10)^2 * P.\n\nThe problem states that after two years, the population is exactly double what it was one year ago. So, the population two years from now is 2 * P.\n\nSo, setting up the equation: (1.10)^2 * P = 2 * P.\n\nWait, let's write that out. 1.1 squared is 1.21. So, 1.21 * P equals 2 * P?\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because 1.21 * P is less than 2P. So, 1.21 P = 2P? That would imply that 1.21 = 2, which is impossible. That can't be correct. So I must have made a mistake in setting up the variables.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. So, that's the future. If that comes true, the population two years from now is exactly double the population of one year ago.\n\nWait, the population two years from now is double the population one year ago. So, if P is the population one year ago, then the population two years from now is 2P.\n\nBut wait, what's the population two years from now? Let me recast it.\n\nLet me make a timeline.\n\n- Let t be the current time.\n\n- Then, one year ago would be t - 1.\n\n- Two years from now is t + 2.\n\nSo, the problem says that the population at t+2 is double the population at t-1.\n\nWait, that's a key point. So, the population at t+2 is 2 times the population at t-1.\n\nBut the problem is asking about the percentage increase over the last year, which would be from t-1 to t.\n\nSo, the question is: What was the population increase from t-1 to t, given that from t to t+1 it increases by 10%, and from t+1 to t+2 another 10% (so 10% of the new value each time), and that at t+2, the population is double that at t-1.\n\nHmm, let me define the variables more clearly.\n\nLet me let P be the population at time t-1 (one year ago).\n\nPopulation at t (current time) is P_current.\n\nPopulation at t+1 (next year) is P * 1.10.\n\nPopulation at t+2 (two years from now) is (P * 1.10) * 1.10 = P * (1.10)^2.\n\nAccording to the problem, this population at t+2 is double that at t-1. So:\n\nP * (1.10)^2 = 2 * P.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if I divide both sides by P (assuming P isn't zero), I get (1.10)^2 = 2. But 1.21 isn't 2. That's a contradiction. So, I must have messed up the timeline.\n\nWait a second, maybe the 10% increase is expected for the next two years, but perhaps the problem is considering that the growth rate is 10% per year for two years, leading to a doubling. But that would only be the case if the growth rate is higher, like over 40% per year, because 1.414 squared is about 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the initial setup. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe problem says: If the projection comes true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\n\nWait, perhaps the one year ago is the starting point, and the next two years are being projected. So, let's think of it as:\n\nLet P be the population one year ago.\n\nThe next year (this year) it increases by 10%, so becomes P * 1.10.\n\nThe following year (the year after next, two years from now), it increases by another 10%, so becomes 1.10 * (1.10 P) = 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem states that this 1.21 P is equal to 2 * P.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1.21 P equals 2P would imply 1.21 = 2, which isn't true. So, that suggests that perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the 10% increase is not for the next two years, but over the next two years, meaning the average annual growth rate is 10% over two years. So, the total growth would be 1.10^2, which is 1.21, but that's not enough to double the population.\n\nWait, but the problem says that if the projection comes true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. So, maybe I need to model it differently.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me denote the population one year ago as P. Then, the population two years from now (after two years of 10% growth) is P * (1.10)^2.\n\nAccording to the problem, this is equal to 2 * P.\n\nWait, so:\n\nP * (1.10)^2 = 2 P\n\nDivide both sides by P (assuming P \u2260 0):\n\n(1.10)^2 = 2\n\nBut 1.21 is not equal to 2. So that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps my initial setup is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the 10% increase is for each of the next two years, and the population two years from now is double what it was one year ago. So, the population two years from now is 2 * (population one year ago).\n\nBut that would mean that the growth over two years is 100% (from P to 2P). So, the growth rate over two years is 100% of the original. So, the annual growth rate r would satisfy (1 + r)^2 = 2.\n\nSo, (1 + r)^2 = 2 \u2192 1 + r = sqrt(2) \u2248 1.4142 \u2192 r \u2248 0.4142, or 41.42% per year.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the expected growth rate is 10% per year, not 41%. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not about the next two years, but about the projection over the next two years leading to a doubling. So, perhaps the expected growth rate would cause the population to double in two years. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps the 10% is not the annual rate leading to the doubling, but the current growth rate. Let me reevaluate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the past year's growth rate, given that the projection for the next two years (at 10% each year) would cause the population to double compared to one year ago.\n\nWait, let me model it again.\n\nLet me let P be the population one year ago (t-1).\n\nThe current population is P_current.\n\nThe next year (t+1), the population is P_current * 1.10.\n\nThe year after that (t+2), it's (P_current * 1.10) * 1.10 = P_current * (1.10)^2.\n\nThe problem says that at t+2, the population is double that at t-1. So:\n\nP_current * (1.10)^2 = 2 * P.\n\nBut P_current is the population at time t. How is that related to P (t-1)?\n\nWell, the question is about the population increase over the last year, which would be from t-1 to t. So, let me denote the growth rate from t-1 to t as r (in decimal form). So:\n\nP_current = P * (1 + r).\n\nSo, substituting back into the earlier equation:\n\nP * (1 + r) * (1.10)^2 = 2 * P.\n\nWe can divide both sides by P (assuming P \u2260 0):\n\n(1 + r) * (1.10)^2 = 2.\n\nNow, let's compute (1.10)^2 = 1.21.\n\nSo, (1 + r) * 1.21 = 2 \u2192 1 + r = 2 / 1.21 \u2192 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo, 1 + r \u2248 1.65289 \u2192 r \u2248 0.65289, which is about 65.29%.\n\nSo, the growth rate over the last year was approximately 65.29%. Looking at the options, option D is 65%, which is the closest.\n\nWait, let me double-check the math. Let's compute 2 / 1.21 exactly.\n\n1.21 is 121/100. So, 2/(121/100) = 2 * 100/121 = 200/121 \u2248 1.65289256.\n\nSo, yes, r \u2248 0.65289256, which is approximately 65.29%, so the closest option is D)65%.\n",

Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says that Boomtown's population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years.

I need to find the percent population increase over the last year, and the options are A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. Let's denote the current population as P. Wait, but wait\u2014what's the timeline here? Let me think. The projection is for the next two years, so starting from now. But the population two years from now is double the population of one year ago. So, let me map out the time points.\n\nLet me assign some variables to make this clearer. Let's say:\n\n- Let P be the population one year ago.\n- So, the population last year (one year ago) is P.\n- Now, the population now is after one year of growth. Wait, but the question says the projection is for the next two years. Oh, wait, perhaps the current time is now, and the next two years are from now. So, maybe the population one year ago is P, and the current population is, say, P0.\n\nWait, maybe I should define it differently. Let me think.\n\nLet me set the population one year ago as P. Then, the current population (this year) would be after one year of growth, but I don't know the rate for that. The problem says that the projection is for the next two years, which is 10% per year. So the next two years (from now) will have 10% growth each year.\n\nWait, the question says that the population two years from now will be double what it was one year ago. So, two years from now is P * (1 + 10%)^2, and that's equal to twice the population one year ago, which is 2P.\n\nWait, let me write that equation. Let me clarify the timeline.\n\nLet's let P be the population one year ago. So, last year's population was P.\n\nThis year's population is after one year of growth. But the problem doesn't specify the growth rate for this year. It only says that the next two years (from now) will have 10% growth each year.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking about the growth over the last year, which is from one year ago to now. So, perhaps the current population is higher than P, and the next two years will add more growth.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n- Let P = population one year ago (last year).\n- Let Q = current population (this year). So, from last year to this year, the population increased by some percentage, say x%. So, Q = P * (1 + x/100).\n\nThen, for the next two years, the population is projected to increase by 10% each year. So, next year (Year 1 from now) will be Q * 1.10. Then, the year after that (Year 2 from now) will be Q * 1.10^2.\n\nAccording to the problem, the population two years from now (Year 2) is exactly double the population of one year ago (which was P). So:\n\nYear 2 population = P * 2.\n\nSo,\n\nQ * (1.10)^2 = 2P.\n\nBut Q is equal to P*(1 + x/100). So substituting:\n\nP*(1 + x/100) * (1.10)^2 = 2P.\n\nWe can cancel out P from both sides (assuming P \u2260 0, which it isn't).\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + x/100) * (1.10)^2 = 2.\n\nCompute (1.10)^2 first. 1.1 * 1.1 is 1.21.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + x/100) * 1.21 = 2.\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + x/100 = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCalculate 2 divided by 1.21.\n\nHmm, let me compute that. 1.21 is 121/100, so 2/(121/100) = 2 * 100/121 \u2248 200/121 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo,\n\n1 + x/100 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\nx/100 \u2248 0.65289.\n\nMultiply both sides by 100:\n\nx \u2248 65.289%.\n\nSo, the population increased by approximately 65.29% over the last year.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 65%, which is the closest.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this population growth problem. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says that Boomtown's population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. So, if that happens, the population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago. I need to find the percent population increase over the last year, and the options are A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. Let's denote the current population as P. Wait, but wait\u2014what's the timeline here? Let me think. The projection is for the next two years, so starting from now. But the population two years from now is double the population of one year ago. So, let me map out the time points.\n\nLet me assign some variables to make this clearer. Let's say:\n\n- Let P be the population one year ago.\n- So, the population last year (one year ago) is P.\n- Now, the population now is after one year of growth. Wait, but the question says the projection is for the next two years. Oh, wait, perhaps the current time is now, and the next two years are from now. So, maybe the population one year ago is P, and the current population is, say, P0.\n\nWait, maybe I should define it differently. Let me think.\n\nLet me set the population one year ago as P. Then, the current population (this year) would be after one year of growth, but I don't know the rate for that. The problem says that the projection is for the next two years, which is 10% per year. So the next two years (from now) will have 10% growth each year.\n\nWait, the question says that the population two years from now will be double what it was one year ago. So, two years from now is P * (1 + 10%)^2, and that's equal to twice the population one year ago, which is 2P.\n\nWait, let me write that equation. Let me clarify the timeline.\n\nLet's let P be the population one year ago. So, last year's population was P.\n\nThis year's population is after one year of growth. But the problem doesn't specify the growth rate for this year. It only says that the next two years (from now) will have 10% growth each year.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking about the growth over the last year, which is from one year ago to now. So, perhaps the current population is higher than P, and the next two years will add more growth.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n- Let P = population one year ago (last year).\n- Let Q = current population (this year). So, from last year to this year, the population increased by some percentage, say x%. So, Q = P * (1 + x/100).\n\nThen, for the next two years, the population is projected to increase by 10% each year. So, next year (Year 1 from now) will be Q * 1.10. Then, the year after that (Year 2 from now) will be Q * 1.10^2.\n\nAccording to the problem, the population two years from now (Year 2) is exactly double the population of one year ago (which was P). So:\n\nYear 2 population = P * 2.\n\nSo,\n\nQ * (1.10)^2 = 2P.\n\nBut Q is equal to P*(1 + x/100). So substituting:\n\nP*(1 + x/100) * (1.10)^2 = 2P.\n\nWe can cancel out P from both sides (assuming P \u2260 0, which it isn't).\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + x/100) * (1.10)^2 = 2.\n\nCompute (1.10)^2 first. 1.1 * 1.1 is 1.21.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + x/100) * 1.21 = 2.\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + x/100 = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCalculate 2 divided by 1.21.\n\nHmm, let me compute that. 1.21 is 121/100, so 2/(121/100) = 2 * 100/121 \u2248 200/121 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo,\n\n1 + x/100 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\nx/100 \u2248 0.65289.\n\nMultiply both sides by 100:\n\nx \u2248 65.289%.\n\nSo, the population increased by approximately 65.29% over the last year.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 65%, which is the closest.
