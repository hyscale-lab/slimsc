      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a factory producing staplers. Hmm, let's see. The question says that 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. Then, 2% of the non-defective ones were rejected by mistake. And they told me that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. I need to find out the total number of staplers produced that day. The options are A to E, with numbers ranging from 4,000 to 5,000.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I think I should figure out how many non-defective staplers there were. Because if 10% were defective, then 90% were non-defective. So, if I let the total number be T, then the non-defective would be 0.9T.\n\nWait, but then 2% of these non-defective ones were rejected. And that number is given as 72. So, 2% of 0.9T equals 72. Let me write that as an equation. 0.02 * (0.9T) = 72. \n\nLet me compute this step by step. 0.02 times 0.9 is 0.018. So, 0.018 * T = 72. To find T, I can divide both sides by 0.018. So T equals 72 divided by 0.018.\n\nCalculating that... 72 divided by 0.018. Hmm, 0.018 is the same as 18/1000. So 72 divided by (18/1000) is 72 * (1000/18). Let me compute 72 /18 first. 72 divided by 18 is 4. So then 4 times 1000 is 4,000. So T is 4,000. Wait, but wait a minute, is that right?\n\nWait, let me double-check the math. 0.018 times T equals 72. So T is 72 / 0.018. Let me compute 72 divided by 0.018. \n\nWell, 0.018 times 4,000 is 72. Because 0.018 * 4,000 = 72. Yes, that's correct. So the total number produced would be 4,000. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 4,000. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Did I account for all the non-defective? Because 10% defective, so 90% non-defective. So non-defective is 0.9T. Then 2% of those were rejected, which is 72. So yeah, that's what I did. So I think it's correct.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the factory and the staplers. Let me read it carefully again.\n\nAlright, the problem says that 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. So, if the total number of staplers produced is, say, N, then the defective ones would be 0.10 * N. That makes sense. The rest, which is 90% of N, should be non-defective because 100% minus 10% is 90%. So, non-defective staplers are 0.90 * N.\n\nNow, the next part says that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. So, from the non-defective ones, 2% got rejected. Let me think. So the number of non-defective staplers is 0.90N, and 2% of that is rejected. So that's 0.02 * 0.90N. \n\nThe problem states that 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected. So, I can set up an equation here. The number of rejected non-defective staplers is 0.02 * (0.90N) = 72.\n\nLet me write that out: 0.02 * 0.90 * N = 72. Let me compute the left side. 0.02 times 0.90 is... let's see, 0.02 * 0.9 is 0.018. So 0.018 * N = 72.\n\nHmm, so to find N, I can divide both sides by 0.018. So N = 72 / 0.018. Let me calculate that. Wait, 72 divided by 0.018. Hmm, maybe it's easier to think in terms of moving the decimal. 0.018 is 18 thousandths. So 72 divided by 18 thousandths is the same as 72 multiplied by (1000/18). \n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate the decimal. So 72 * 1000 = 72000, and 0.018 * 1000 is 18. So now it's 72000 / 18. Let me compute that. 72000 divided by 18.\n\nWell, 18 times 4000 is 72,000 because 18*4000=72,000. So 72000/18 =4000. Oh, so N is 4000. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I make mistakes in the calculation. So the equation was 0.02 * (0.90N) =72. So 0.018 N =72. N=72 /0.018. \n\nLet me compute 72 /0.018. 72 divided by 0.018. Hmm, 0.018 goes into 72 how many times? Let's think in terms of moving decimals. Multiply numerator and denominator by 1000: 72000 / 18, which is 4000. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the total number of staplers produced that day is 4000. Looking at the options, option A is 4,000.
