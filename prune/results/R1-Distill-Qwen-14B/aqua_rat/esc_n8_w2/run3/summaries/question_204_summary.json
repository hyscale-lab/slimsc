      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is asking: What is 60% of 30% of 1400 grams? Hmm, percentages can sometimes trip me up, but I think I can handle this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you're dealing with percentages, you can convert them into decimals to make calculations easier. So, 30% would be 0.3, and 60% would be 0.6. But wait, the question is a bit tricky because it's 60% of 30% of 1400 grams. That means I have to calculate it in two steps, right?\n\nLet me break it down. I'll start with the 30% of 1400 grams. So, 30% is the same as 0.3, and I multiply that by 1400. Let me write that out: 0.3 * 1400. Hmm, calculating that... Well, 1400 divided by 10 is 140, so 10% of 1400 is 140. Then 30% is three times that. 140 times 3 is 420. So 30% of 1400 grams is 420 grams. Okay, that's the first part.\n\nNow, the next part is 60% of that result. So, 60% of 420 grams. Again, I'll convert 60% to 0.6. So, 0.6 * 420. Let me compute that. Alternatively, I can think of 60% as 60 per 100, so 60/100 * 420. Let me compute 420 divided by 100 first, which is 4.2, then multiply by 60. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 60% of 420 is the same as 420 multiplied by 0.6. Let me do that. 420 * 0.6. Hmm, 400 *0.6 is 240, and 20 *0.6 is 12. So adding them together, 240 +12 is 252. So, 60% of 420 is 252 grams.\n\nWait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to calculate 60% of 420 is to find 10% of 420 and then multiply by 6. 10% of 420 is 42, so 42 *6 is 252. Yep, that's correct. So the final answer should be 252 grams.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 252 gms. So the correct answer is C. Let me just scan the other options quickly. Option A is 450 grams, which is much higher. Option B is 100 grams, that's too low. Option D is 240, which is close but not quite 252. So yes, option C is the right choice.\n",

Hmm, percentages can sometimes trip me up, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, first, I remember that percentages are just fractions of 100. So when the question says 30% of 1400 grams, that's like saying 30 per 100 of 1400. To calculate that, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. Oh right, 30% is 0.30. So I multiply 1400 by 0.30.\n\nLet me do that multiplication. 1400 times 0.3. Hmm, 1400 times 0.3 is the same as 1400 divided by 10 times 3, right?

So I multiply 420 by 0.6. Let me think, 420 times 0.6. Well, 400 times 0.6 is 240, and 20 times 0.6 is 12, so adding those together gives me 252. So 60% of 420 grams is 252 grams.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Another way to calculate it is to multiply all the percentages together first. So 60% of 30% is like 0.6 * 0.3 = 0.18. Then 0.18 times 1400 grams. Let me compute that: 1400 * 0.18. Hmm, 1400 * 0.1 is 140, and 1400 * 0.08 is 112. Adding those gives 252 grams. Yep, same result.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 252 grams, so that should be the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. 30% of 1400 is 420, that's right.
