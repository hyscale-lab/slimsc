      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the problem is about mixing sand and clay, right? We have a 10 kg mixture that's 30% sand and 70% clay. We need to remove some of this mixture and replace it with pure sand so that the final mixture has equal amounts of clay and sand. Hmm, I think I remember something about these types of problems from algebra.\n\nWait, let me get the details straight. The initial mixture is 10 kg. 30% is sand, so that's 0.3 * 10 = 3 kg of sand. The rest is clay, which is 7 kg. Our goal is to have equal parts sand and clay, which would mean each is 5 kg because 10 kg total divided by two is 5 kg each. So we need to increase the sand from 3 kg to 5 kg. That means we need to add 2 kg of sand. But wait, how does that work with removing and replacing?\n\nAh, right, we're removing some mixture and adding pure sand. So when we remove a portion of the mixture, we're taking away both sand and clay. Let me think about this. Let's say we remove x kg of the mixture. The composition of this removed mixture will be the same as the original, which is 30% sand and 70% clay. So the amount of sand removed is 0.3x, and clay removed is 0.7x.\n\nAfter removing x kg, the remaining sand is 3 - 0.3x, and the remaining clay is 7 - 0.7x. Then we add x kg of pure sand. So the new sand amount becomes (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x. The clay remains at 7 - 0.7x.\n\nWe want the sand and clay to be equal. So set up the equation:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nLet me solve this. Combine like terms. So 0.7x + 0.7x = 7 -3.\n\n1.4x =4\n\nx =4 / 1.4\n\nWait, 4 divided by 1.4. Let me compute that. 4 \u00f7 1.4 is the same as 40 \u00f714, which simplifies to 20/7. Oh, because 14*20=280, 14*7=98. Wait, no, 40 \u00f714 is 20/7. Right.\n\nSo x is 20/7 kg. Let me check the options. Option B is 20/7. That seems right. So we need to remove 20/7 kg of the mixture and replace it with pure sand.\n\nWait, let me verify this. Let's plug x=20/7 back into the equations.\n\nSand after removal: 3 - 0.3*(20/7) = 3 - (6/7) = (21/7 -6/7)=15/7 kg.\n\nAdd x kg of sand: 15/7 +20/7 =35/7=5 kg. That's good.\n\nClay after removal:7 - 0.7*(20/7)=7 - (14/7)=7-2=5 kg. Yep, that works. So yes, removing 20/7 kg and replacing with pure sand gives equal parts.\n\nSo the answer should be option B, 20/7.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by analyzing the initial mixture. The 10 kg mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay, which means it has 3 kg of sand and 7 kg of clay. The goal is to make the mixture contain equal quantities of sand and clay, i.e., 5 kg each. This requires increasing the sand content from 3 kg to 5 kg by removing a portion of the mixture and replacing it with pure sand.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the amount of mixture removed. Since the mixture is uniform, the removed portion will contain 30% sand and 70% clay. Therefore, the amount of sand removed is \\( 0.3x \\), and the amount of clay removed is \\( 0.7x \\). After removing \\( x \\) kg of the mixture, the remaining sand is \\( 3 - 0.3x \\), and the remaining clay is \\( 7 - 0.7x \\). Adding \\( x \\) kg of pure sand results in a new sand content of \\( (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x \\).

To do that, we need to remove some of the mixture and replace it with pure sand.

Let me think. So initially, the mixture is 10 kg. 30% is sand, which is 3 kg, and 70% is clay, which is 7 kg. Because 30% of 10 is 3, and 70% is 7.

So, removing 20/7 kg of the mixture, which is about 2.857 kg. Let me plug it back into the equations.\n\nOriginal sand: 3 kg, clay:7 kg.\n\nRemoving 20/7 kg: sand removed is 0.3*(20/7) = 6/7 kg.
