      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the shopkeeper employs a servant with a monthly salary of 1500 rupees. Oh, and there's also a commission involved. The commission is 15% on the monthly sales. The servant wants his monthly income to be 6000 rupees. The question is, what sale amount does he need to make?\n\nWait, so the servant gets a fixed salary plus a percentage of the sales. I think I need to calculate the required sales so that when you add the salary and the commission, it equals 6000.\n\nLet me break it down. The total income is the sum of the fixed salary and the commission. So, the formula should be: Total Income = Salary + (Commission Rate \u00d7 Sales).\n\nThe given values are:\n- Salary = 1500 rupees.\n- Desired Total Income = 6000 rupees.\n- Commission Rate = 15%, which is 0.15 in decimal.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: 6000 = 1500 + (0.15 \u00d7 Sales).\n\nWait, I need to solve for Sales. Let me subtract the salary from both sides to find out how much the commission needs to be. So, 6000 minus 1500 is 4500. That means the commission must be 4500 rupees.\n\nSince commission is 15% of sales, I can set up the equation: 0.15 \u00d7 Sales = 4500. To find Sales, I'll divide 4500 by 0.15.\n\nLet me calculate that. 4500 divided by 0.15. Hmm, 0.15 goes into 4500 how many times? Well, 0.15 times 30000 is 4500, because 0.15 times 10000 is 1500, so 3 times that is 4500. So Sales must be 30,000 rupees.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 30000. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If the sales are 30000, then 15% of that is 4500. Adding the salary 1500 gives 6000, which matches the desired income. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option A.\n",

Additionally, the servant gets a 15% commission on the monthly sales. The servant wants his monthly income to be 6000 rupees. The question is, what sale amount does he need to achieve?\n\nHmm, right. So the servant's total income is his fixed salary plus the commission from sales. We need to find the sale amount that makes his total income 6000.\n\nLet me break it down. The fixed salary is 1500. So the commission must make up the rest. 6000 minus 1500 is 4500. So the commission he earns is 4500 rupees.\n\nNow, the commission is 15% of the sale. Let me denote the sale as S. So 15% of S equals 4500. That translates to 0.15 * S = 4500.\n\nTo find S, I can rearrange the equation. S = 4500 / 0.15. Let me calculate that. 4500 divided by 0.15. Hmm, 0.15 times 30,000 is 4500 because 0.15 * 30,000 = 4500. So S would be 30,000.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. 15% of 30,000 is 0.15 *30000 = 4500. Adding the salary, 1500 +4500=6000.

The salary is 1500, and the desired total is 6000. So the commission needed is indeed 4500. 15% of what is 4500? Yes, 4500 / 0.15 = 30,000. So yes, A is correct.\n",
