      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this business problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what's going on.\n\nThe problem says that A starts a business with Rs.40,000. Then, after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Some time later, C joins with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nHmm, so the key here is to find out the time each person invested their money for. Because in a business, profit is divided based on the investment and the time period for which the investment was made.\n\nI remember that the profit sharing ratio is determined by the product of the capital invested and the time period for which it was invested. So each partner's share is proportional to their capital multiplied by the time they were in the business.\n\nLet me outline the time each person was involved:\n\n- A started first. So he was in the business for the entire year, which is 12 months. His capital is Rs.40,000.\n\n- B joined after 2 months, so he was there for 12 - 2 = 10 months. His capital is Rs.60,000.\n\n- C joined after some time. Wait, the question says 'after some more time' after B joined. So the total time C was in the business is 12 minus the time when he joined. But we don't know when exactly C joined. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says C joined after some more time after B had joined. So let's denote the time when C joined. Let me think about the timeline.\n\nLet me structure it:\n\n- A starts at month 0.\n\n- B joins at month 2.\n\n- C joins after some months from B's joining. Let's say C joined x months after B. So C joined at month 2 + x.\n\nSince the total time is a year (12 months), the time C was in the business is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me correct that. The total time the business ran is 12 months. So C joined at month (2 + x), and the time he stayed is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. Hmm, but x can't be more than 10, because then C would have negative time, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, but the options given include 23 and 24 months, which are way beyond a year. Oh wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I got the variables wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the time each person's investment was active.\n\nLet me model the time each person's money was in the business.\n\nA's investment: 40,000 for 12 months.\n\nB's investment: 60,000 for (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n\nC's investment: 120,000 for (12 - t) months, where t is the month when C joined. Because the business is for 12 months, so if C joined at month t, he was there for 12 - t months.\n\nBut when did C join? Let's see. After B joined, which was at month 2. So t is 2 + x, where x is the number of months after B joined that C joined. So C's time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. For example, if C joined 4 months after B, then t is 2+4=6 months. So C was in for 12-6=6 months.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the time each person was present.\n\nSo:\n\n- A: 12 months.\n\n- B: 10 months.\n\n- C: (12 - t) months, where t is the month he joined.\n\nBut t is after B joined, which was at 2 months.\n\nSo t must be greater than 2. But since the business is only 12 months, t can't be more than 12.\n\nSo, the time C was in is 12 - t = 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months, where x is the number of months after B joined.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of months from when each joined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the profit sharing.\n\nThe profit is divided in the ratio of their investments multiplied by the time they were in.\n\nSo, Profit shares:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12.\n\nB: 60,000 * (12 - 2) = 60,000 *10.\n\nC: 120,000 * t, where t is the time C was in the business.\n\nWait, but C joined after B, so the time C was in the business is (12 - (2 + x)), where x is the number of months after B joined that C joined.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to let x be the number of months after B joined that C joined. So C's time is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months.\n\nBut wait, x can't be more than 10, because then C's time would be negative, which is impossible.\n\nSo the total profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000.\n\nSo, the profit is divided in the ratio of A:B:C = (40,000*12) : (60,000*10) : (120,000*(10 -x)).\n\nWait, but 120,000*(10 - x) is the product for C.\n\nSo, let's compute each part:\n\nA's share: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB's share: 60,000 *10 = 600,000.\n\nC's share: 120,000 * (10 -x) = 1,200,000*(10 -x) ?\n\nWait, 120,000 * (10 -x) = 120,000 * (10 -x) = 1,200,000 (10 -x) ?\n\nWait, no, 120,000 multiplied by (10 -x) is 120,000*(10-x) = 1,200,000*(10-x) only if x is in thousands. Wait, no, 120,000 is 120 thousand. So 120,000 * (10 -x) is 120,000*(10 -x) = 1,200,000*(10 -x) ? No, that's not right. Let me compute each term correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write the ratios.\n\nThe ratio is:\n\nA : B : C = (40,000 *12) : (60,000 *10) : (120,000 * t_c)\n\nWhere t_c is the time C was in the business.\n\nBut t_c is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x, where x is the months after B joined that C joined.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently.\n\nThe total profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000. So C's share is 150,000.\n\nThe ratio of C's share to the total profit is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 = 0.4, or 40%.\n\nWait, but maybe I should calculate the profit ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of all shares equals 375,000.\n\nSo, A's share is 40,000 *12 = 480,000.\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be, because 480,000 is larger than the total profit of 375,000. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the ratios work.\n\nWait, no, the profit is 375,000, so the total of A, B, and C's shares must add up to that.\n\nSo, the sum of their individual (capital * time) should be in the same ratio as their profit.\n\nWait, no, actually, the ratio is (capital * time). So the sum of these is the total 'capital-time' units. The profit is divided based on this ratio.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each person's profit is proportional to (capital * time). So the ratio of A:B:C is (40000 *12) : (60000 *10) : (120000 * t_c), where t_c is the time C was in.\n\nSo let's compute each term:\n\nA: 40000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB: 60000 *10 = 600,000.\n\nC: 120000 * t_c.\n\nSo the total ratio sum is 480,000 + 600,000 + (120000 * t_c) = 1,080,000 + 120,000 t_c.\n\nThe total profit is 375,000, which is divided in this ratio.\n\nSo, C's share is 150,000, which is (120,000 * t_c) / (1,080,000 + 120,000 t_c) ) * 375,000.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to find the proportion of C's share.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s compute the ratio of each person's contribution.\n\nA:B:C = 480,000 : 600,000 : (120,000 * t_c)\n\nSimplify each term by dividing by 1000:\n\n480 : 600 : 120 t_c\n\nWe can divide each by 120 to make it simpler:\n\n4 : 5 : t_c.\n\nWait, 480 \u00f7 120 =4, 600 \u00f7120=5, 120 t_c \u00f7120= t_c.\n\nSo the ratio is 4 :5 : t_c.\n\nWait, no, because 480,000 is 480 * 1000, so after dividing each by 1000, we get 480 : 600 : 120 t_c.\n\nThen, to simplify, divide each by 120: 480/120=4, 600/120=5, 120 t_c /120= t_c.\n\nSo the ratio becomes 4 :5 : t_c.\n\nSo the sum of the ratios is 4 +5 + t_c =9 + t_c.\n\nThe total profit is 375,000, so each part of the ratio corresponds to 375,000 / (9 + t_c).\n\nC's share is t_c * (375,000 / (9 + t_c)) ) = 150,000.\n\nSo,\n\nt_c * (375000) / (9 + t_c) ) = 150000.\n\nLet me write this as an equation:\n\nt_c * 375,000 = 150,000 * (9 + t_c)\n\nDivide both sides by 1000 to simplify:\n\nt_c * 375 = 150 * (9 + t_c)\n\n375 t_c = 150*(9 + t_c)\n\nDivide both sides by 15:\n\n25 t_c = 10*(9 + t_c)\n\n25 t_c = 90 +10 t_c\n\n25 t_c -10 t_c =90 \u2192 15 t_c=90 \u2192 t_c=90/15=6 months.\n\nWait, so t_c is 6 months. That's the time C was in the business.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought t_c was 10 - x, where x is the months after B joined that C joined.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me clarify: t_c is the time C was in the business, which is 12 - (2 + x) =10 - x months, as x is the months after B joined (who joined at month 2).\n\nSo, t_c =10 -x \u2192 6=10 -x \u2192 x=4 months.\n\nSo, C joined 4 months after B joined.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4 months. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me check all the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, A: 40000 for 12 months \u2192 480000.\n\nB:60000 for 10 months \u2192600000.\n\nC:120000 for 6 months \u2192720000.\n\nSo the ratio is 480000 :600000 :720000.\n\nSimplify by dividing each by 60000 \u2192 8 : 10 : 12.\n\nWait, 480000 /60000=8, 600000/60000=10, 720000/60000=12.\n\nSo the ratio is 8 :10 :12, which simplifies to 4:5:6 when divided by 2.\n\nWait, but earlier when I simplified, I thought it was 4:5:t_c, but t_c came to 6.\n\nSo the ratio is 4:5:6. So the sum is 4+5+6=15 parts.\n\nTotal profit is 375,000.\n\nEach part is 375,000 /15 =25,000.\n\nSo A's share: 4 *25,000=100,000.\n\nB's share:5 *25,000=125,000.\n\nC's share:6 *25,000=150,000. Which matches the given data.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo t_c is 6 months, which means C joined 6 months before the end of the year (since the business is 12 months). Alternatively, since the business is from month 0 to month 12, C joined at month (12-6)=6.\n\nSo C joined at month 6. B joined at month 2, so the time between B joining and C joining is 6 -2=4 months.\n\nSo the answer is 4 months, which is option B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine how many months after B joined the business did C join.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this business problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what's going on.\n\nThe problem says that A starts a business with Rs.40,000. Then, after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Some time later, C joins with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nHmm, so the key here is to find out the time each person invested their money for. Because in a business, profit is divided based on the investment and the time period for which the investment was made.\n\nI remember that the profit sharing ratio is determined by the product of the capital invested and the time period for which it was invested.

His capital is Rs.60,000.\n\n- C joined after some time. Wait, the question says 'after some more time' after B joined. So the total time C was in the business is 12 minus the time when he joined. But we don't know when exactly C joined. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says C joined after some more time after B had joined. So let's denote the time when C joined. Let me think about the timeline.\n\nLet me structure it:\n\n- A starts at month 0.\n\n- B joins at month 2.\n\n- C joins after some months from B's joining. Let's say C joined x months after B. So C joined at month 2 + x.\n\nSince the total time is a year (12 months), the time C was in the business is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me correct that. The total time the business ran is 12 months. So C joined at month (2 + x), and the time he stayed is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. Hmm, but x can't be more than 10, because then C would have negative time, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, but the options given include 23 and 24 months, which are way beyond a year. Oh wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I got the variables wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the time each person's investment was active.\n\nLet me model the time each person's money was in the business.\n\nA's investment: 40,000 for 12 months.\n\nB's investment: 60,000 for (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n\nC's investment: 120,000 for (12 - t) months, where t is the month when C joined. Because the business is for 12 months, so if C joined at month t, he was there for 12 - t months.\n\nBut when did C join? Let's see. After B joined, which was at month 2. So t is 2 + x, where x is the number of months after B joined that C joined. So C's time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. For example, if C joined 4 months after B, then t is 2+4=6 months. So C was in for 12-6=6 months.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the time each person was present.\n\nSo:\n\n- A: 12 months.\n\n- B: 10 months.\n\n- C: (12 - t) months, where t is the month he joined.\n\nBut t is after B joined, which was at 2 months.\n\nSo t must be greater than 2. But since the business is only 12 months, t can't be more than 12.\n\nSo, the time C was in is 12 - t = 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months, where x is the number of months after B joined.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of months from when each joined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the profit sharing.\n\nThe profit is divided in the ratio of their investments multiplied by the time they were in.\n\nSo, Profit shares:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12.\n\nB: 60,000 * (12 - 2) = 60,000 *10.\n\nC: 120,000 * t, where t is the time C was in the business.\n\nWait, but C joined after B, so the time C was in the business is (12 - (2 + x)), where x is the number of months after B joined that C joined.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to let x be the number of months after B joined that C joined. So C's time is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months.\n\nBut wait, x can't be more than 10, because then C's time would be negative, which is impossible.\n\nSo the total profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000.\n\nSo, the profit is divided in the ratio of A:B:C = (40,000*12) : (60,000*10) : (120,000*(10 -x)).\n\nWait, but 120,000*(10 - x) is the product for C.\n\nSo, let's compute each part:\n\nA's share: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB's share: 60,000 *10 = 600,000.\n\nC's share: 120,000 * (10 -x) = 1,200,000*(10 -x) ?\n\nWait, 120,000 * (10 -x) = 120,000 * (10 -x) = 1,200,000 (10 -x) ?\n\nWait, no, 120,000 multiplied by (10 -x) is 120,000*(10-x) = 1,200,000*(10-x) only if x is in thousands. Wait, no, 120,000 is 120 thousand. So 120,000 * (10 -x) is 120,000*(10 -x) = 1,200,000*(10 -x) ? No, that's not right. Let me compute each term correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write the ratios.\n\nThe ratio is:\n\nA : B : C = (40,000 *12) : (60,000 *10) : (120,000 * t_c)\n\nWhere t_c is the time C was in the business.\n\nBut t_c is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x, where x is the months after B joined that C joined.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently.\n\nThe total profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000. So C's share is 150,000.\n\nThe ratio of C's share to the total profit is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 = 0.4, or 40%.\n\nWait, but maybe I should calculate the profit ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of all shares equals 375,000.\n\nSo, A's share is 40,000 *12 = 480,000.\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be, because 480,000 is larger than the total profit of 375,000. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the ratios work.\n\nWait, no, the profit is 375,000, so the total of A, B, and C's shares must add up to that.\n\nSo, the sum of their individual (capital * time) should be in the same ratio as their profit.\n\nWait, no, actually, the ratio is (capital * time). So the sum of these is the total 'capital-time' units. The profit is divided based on this ratio.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each person's profit is proportional to (capital * time). So the ratio of A:B:C is (40000 *12) : (60000 *10) : (120000 * t_c), where t_c is the time C was in.\n\nSo let's compute each term:\n\nA: 40000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB: 60000 *10 = 600,000.\n\nC: 120000 * t_c.\n\nSo the total ratio sum is 480,000 + 600,000 + (120000 * t_c) = 1,080,000 + 120,000 t_c.\n\nThe total profit is 375,000, which is divided in this ratio.\n\nSo, C's share is 150,000, which is (120,000 * t_c) / (1,080,000 + 120,000 t_c) ) * 375,000.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to find the proportion of C's share.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s compute the ratio of each person's contribution.\n\nA:B:C = 480,000 : 600,000 : (120,000 * t_c)\n\nSimplify each term by dividing by 1000:\n\n480 : 600 : 120 t_c\n\nWe can divide each by 120 to make it simpler:\n\n4 : 5 : t_c.\n\nWait, 480 \u00f7 120 =4, 600 \u00f7120=5, 120 t_c \u00f7120= t_c.\n\nSo the ratio is 4 :5 : t_c.\n\nWait, no, because 480,000 is 480 * 1000, so after dividing each by 1000, we get 480 : 600 : 120 t_c.\n\nThen, to simplify, divide each by 120: 480/120=4, 600/120=5, 120 t_c /120= t_c.\n\nSo the ratio becomes 4 :5 : t_c.\n\nSo the sum of the ratios is 4 +5 + t_c =9 + t_c.\n\nThe total profit is 375,000, so each part of the ratio corresponds to 375,000 / (9 + t_c).\n\nC's share is t_c * (375,000 / (9 + t_c)) ) = 150,000.\n\nSo,\n\nt_c * (375000) / (9 + t_c) ) = 150000.\n\nLet me write this as an equation:\n\nt_c * 375,000 = 150,000 * (9 + t_c)\n\nDivide both sides by 1000 to simplify:\n\nt_c * 375 = 150 * (9 + t_c)\n\n375 t_c = 150*(9 + t_c)\n\nDivide both sides by 15:\n\n25 t_c = 10*(9 + t_c)\n\n25 t_c = 90 +10 t_c\n\n25 t_c -10 t_c =90 \u2192 15 t_c=90 \u2192 t_c=90/15=6 months.\n\nWait, so t_c is 6 months. That's the time C was in the business.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought t_c was 10 - x, where x is the months after B joined that C joined.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me clarify: t_c is the time C was in the business, which is 12 - (2 + x) =10 - x months, as x is the months after B joined (who joined at month 2).\n\nSo, t_c =10 -x \u2192 6=10 -x \u2192 x=4 months.\n\nSo, C joined 4 months after B joined.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4 months. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me check all the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, A: 40000 for 12 months \u2192 480000.\n\nB:60000 for 10 months \u2192600000.\n\nC:120000 for 6 months \u2192720000.\n\nSo the ratio is 480000 :600000 :720000.\n\nSimplify by dividing each by 60000 \u2192 8 : 10 : 12.\n\nWait, 480000 /60000=8, 600000/60000=10, 720000/60000=12.\n\nSo the ratio is 8 :10 :12, which simplifies to 4:5:6 when divided by 2.\n\nWait, but earlier when I simplified, I thought it was 4:5:t_c, but t_c came to 6.\n\nSo the ratio is 4:5:6. So the sum is 4+5+6=15 parts.\n\nTotal profit is 375,000.\n\nEach part is 375,000 /15 =25,000.\n\nSo A's share: 4 *25,000=100,000.\n\nB's share:5 *25,000=125,000.\n\nC's share:6 *25,000=150,000. Which matches the given data.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo t_c is 6 months, which means C joined 6 months before the end of the year (since the business is 12 months). Alternatively, since the business is from month 0 to month 12, C joined at month (12-6)=6.\n\nSo C joined at month 6. B joined at month 2, so the time between B joining and C joining is 6 -2=4 months.\n\nSo the answer is 4 months, which is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine how many months after B joined the business did C join. The profit is divided based on the ratio of each partner's capital multiplied by the time they invested. \n\n### Key Information:\n1. **A's Investment**: Rs. 40,000 for 12 months.\n2. **B's Investment**: Rs. 60,000 for 10 months (since B joined after 2 months).\n3. **C's Investment**: Rs. 120,000 for \\( t_c \\) months, where \\( t_c = 12 - (2 + x) \\), and \\( x \\) is the number of months after B joined that C joined.\n4. **Total Profit**: Rs. 375,000.\n5. **C's Share**: Rs. 150,000.\n\n### Step 1: Profit Sharing Ratio\nThe profit is divided in the ratio of each partner's capital multiplied by the time they invested:\n- **A's Contribution**: \\( 40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000 \\).\n- **B's Contribution**: \\( 60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000 \\).\n- **C's Contribution**: \\( 120,000 \\times t_c \\).\n\nThe total ratio sum is:\n\\[\n480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \\times t_c = 1,080,000 + 120,000 \\times t_c.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Ratio\nDivide each term by 120,000 to simplify:\n\\[\n\\frac{480,000}{120,000} : \\frac{600,000}{120,000} : \\frac{120,000 \\times t_c}{120,000} = 4 : 5 : t_c.\n\\]\n\nThe total ratio sum is:\n\\[\n4 + 5 + t_c = 9 + t_c.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\( t_c \\)\nC's share of the profit is given as Rs. 150,000. Using the ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{C's Share} = \\frac{t_c}{9 + t_c} \\times 375,000 = 150,000.\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\nt_c \\times 375,000 = 150,000 \\times (9 + t_c).\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 1,000:\n\\[\nt_c \\times 375 = 150 \\times (9 + t_c).\n\\]\n\nExpand and solve:\n\\[\n375 t_c = 1,350 + 150 t_c.\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( 150 t_c \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n225 t_c = 1,350.\n\\]\n\nDivide:\n\\[\nt_c = \\frac{1,350}{225} = 6.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( t_c = 6 \\), meaning C was in the business for 6 months.\n\n### Step 4: Determine When C Joined\nC was in the business for \\( t_c = 6 \\) months, and the business ran for 12 months. Therefore, C joined at:\n\\[\n12 - t_c = 12 - 6 = 6 \\text{ months}.\n\\]\n\nSince B joined at month 2, the time between B joining and C joining is:\n\\[\n6 - 2 = 4 \\text{ months}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nC joined 4 months after B joined.\n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about partners in a business and their profit shares. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nThe problem says A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then, C joins after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nHmm, right, this is a problem about partnership and profit sharing based on the time each person's investment was in the business. So the key here is to calculate the ratio of their investments multiplied by the time each was invested, which gives their share of the profit.\n\nLet me think about the timeline. A started first. Then B joined after 2 months. C joined after some more months from B's joining. The total time is a year, which is 12 months.\n\nWait, but the question is about how many months after B joined did C join. So let's break it down.\n\nLet's denote the time each person invested in the business:\n\n- A invested for the entire year, which is 12 months.\n- B joined after 2 months, so B's investment period is (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n- C joined after B, but how many months after? Let's say C joined x months after B. So C's investment period would be (12 - 2 - x) months, because from the start, it's 2 + x months before C joins, and from then until the end of the year is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Let me model it correctly.\n\nThe business runs for a total of 12 months. \n\n- A starts at month 0 and is there for all 12 months.\n- B joins at month 2 and is there until month 12, so that's 10 months.\n- C joins at month (2 + x), where x is the number of months after B joined. So C's investment period is from (2 + x) to 12. So the duration is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, if x is the number of months after B joined, then C's investment is (12 - (2 + x)) months. Because the business ends at 12. So C's time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. But wait, if x is the months after B, then 2 + x is when C joins. So the time C is in is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x. Hmm, but if x is positive, then 10 - x could be less than 10, which makes sense.\n\nBut wait, let me make a table:\n\n- A: 12 months\n- B: 10 months (since he joined after 2 months)\n- C: (12 - (2 + x)) months, where x is the time after B joined. So 12 -2 is 10, minus x gives 10 -x. So C's time is (10 -x) months.\n\nWait, but if x is the number of months after B joined, then yes, C's time is 10 -x months.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model it differently. Let me consider each person's investment as capital multiplied by time, which gives their contribution. The profit is divided based on the ratio of these contributions.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\n- A's investment: 40,000 * 12\n- B's investment: 60,000 * (10)\n- C's investment: 120,000 * (10 - x)\n\nWait, wait, no. Because if C joins x months after B, then the time from the start when C joins is 2 + x months. So the time C is in the business is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the total profit is divided in the ratio of their contributions. The total contribution is the sum of each person's (capital * time).\n\nLet me compute each person's contribution:\n\nA: 40000 * 12 = 480,000\nB: 60000 * (10) = 600,000\nC: 120000 * (10 - x) = 12,000 * (10 - x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 x\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait, 120,000 multiplied by (10 -x) would be 120,000*(10 -x). Let me compute it correctly. 120,000 * 10 is 1,200,000, and 120,000 * x is 120,000x, so 1,200,000 - 120,000x.\n\nSo the total contribution is A + B + C = 480,000 + 600,000 + (1,200,000 - 120,000x) = 480,000 + 600,000 is 1,080,000. Plus 1,200,000 is 2,280,000, minus 120,000x. So total contribution is (2,280,000 - 120,000 x).\n\nNow, the total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to the total profit is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4. So 40% of the profit is C's share.\n\nBut in partnership, the share is based on the ratio of their contributions. So C's contribution over the total contribution should be equal to 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4.\n\nSo,\n\n(C's contribution) / (Total contribution) = 0.4\n\nSo,\n\n[120,000*(10 - x)] / [2,280,000 - 120,000 x] = 0.4\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n(120,000*(10 - x)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 x) = 0.4\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nLet's factor out 12,000 from numerator and denominator.\n\nWait, numerator is 120,000*(10 -x) = 12,000 * 10*(10 -x) = 12,000 * (100 - 10x). Hmm, maybe it's easier to cross-multiply.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n120,000*(10 -x) = 0.4 * (2,280,000 - 120,000 x)\n\nLet me compute each side.\n\nLeft side: 120,000 * (10 -x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 x\n\nRight side: 0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000, and 0.4 * (-120,000 x) = -48,000 x. So right side is 912,000 -48,000 x.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n1,200,000 - 120,000 x = 912,000 -48,000 x\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side.\n\n1,200,000 -912,000 = 120,000 x -48,000 x\n\nCompute 1,200,000 -912,000 = 288,000.\n\n120,000 x -48,000 x =72,000 x.\n\nSo 288,000 =72,000 x\n\nDivide both sides by 72,000:\n\nx=288,000 /72,000 =4.\n\nSo x is 4. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nWait, but the question is how many months after B joined did C join. So the answer would be 4 months. So the correct option is B)4 months.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me plug x=4 back into the contributions and see if the profit ratios hold.\n\nC's time is 10 -4=6 months. So C's contribution is 120,000 *6=720,000.\n\nA's contribution:40,000 *12=480,000.\n\nB's contribution:60,000 *10=600,000.\n\nTotal contribution:480,000 +600,000 +720,000=1,800,000.\n\nC's share ratio:720,000 /1,800,000 =0.4, which is 40%. So 40% of 375,000 is 150,000, which matches. So yes, x=4 is correct.\n\nSo the answer is option B)4 months.\n",

So the ratio of C's share to the total profit is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4. So 40% of the profit is C's share.\n\nBut in partnership, the share is based on the ratio of their contributions. So C's contribution over the total contribution should be equal to 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4.\n\nSo,\n\n(C's contribution) / (Total contribution) = 0.4\n\nSo,\n\n[120,000*(10 - x)] / [2,280,000 - 120,000 x] = 0.4\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n(120,000*(10 - x)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 x) = 0.4\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nLet's factor out 12,000 from numerator and denominator.\n\nWait, numerator is 120,000*(10 -x) = 12,000 * 10*(10 -x) = 12,000 * (100 - 10x). Hmm, maybe it's easier to cross-multiply.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n120,000*(10 -x) = 0.4 * (2,280,000 - 120,000 x)\n\nLet me compute each side.\n\nLeft side: 120,000 * (10 -x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 x\n\nRight side: 0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000, and 0.4 * (-120,000 x) = -48,000 x. So right side is 912,000 -48,000 x.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n1,200,000 - 120,000 x = 912,000 -48,000 x\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side.\n\n1,200,000 -912,000 = 120,000 x -48,000 x\n\nCompute 1,200,000 -912,000 = 288,000.\n\n120,000 x -48,000 x =72,000 x.\n\nSo 288,000 =72,000 x\n\nDivide both sides by 72,000:\n\nx=288,000 /72,000 =4.\n\nSo x is 4. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nWait, but the question is how many months after B joined did C join. So the answer would be 4 months. So the correct option is B)4 months.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me plug x=4 back into the contributions and see if the profit ratios hold.\n\nC's time is 10 -4=6 months. So C's contribution is 120,000 *6=720,000.\n\nA's contribution:40,000 *12=480,000.\n\nB's contribution:60,000 *10=600,000.\n\nTotal contribution:480,000 +600,000 +720,000=1,800,000.\n\nC's share ratio:720,000 /1,800,000 =0.4, which is 40%. So 40% of 375,000 is 150,000, which matches. So yes, x=4 is correct.\n\nSo the answer is option B)4 months.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the contributions of A, B, and C to the business based on their capital investments and the time they were invested. The profit is divided in the ratio of these contributions.\n\n1. **Timeline and Contributions**:\n   - A starts the business with Rs. 40,000 and remains for the entire year (12 months).  \n     **A's contribution**: \\( 40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000 \\)\n   - B joins after 2 months with Rs. 60,000 and remains for \\( 12 - 2 = 10 \\) months.  \n     **B's contribution**: \\( 60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000 \\)\n   - C joins \\( x \\) months after B, so C's investment period is \\( 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x \\) months.  \n     **C's contribution**: \\( 120,000 \\times (10 - x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000x \\)\n\n2. **Total Contribution**:\n   The total contribution is the sum of contributions from A, B, and C:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total contribution} = 480,000 + 600,000 + (1,200,000 - 120,000x) = 2,280,000 - 120,000x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Profit Distribution**:\n   The total profit is Rs. 375,000, and C's share is Rs. 150,000. The ratio of C's share to the total profit is:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{C's share}}{\\text{Total profit}} = \\frac{150,000}{375,000} = 0.4\n   \\]\n   This means C's contribution as a fraction of the total contribution is also \\( 0.4 \\). Thus:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{C's contribution}}{\\text{Total contribution}} = 0.4\n   \\]\n   Substituting the expressions for C's contribution and total contribution:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1,200,000 - 120,000x}{2,280,000 - 120,000x} = 0.4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\( x \\)**:\n   Cross-multiplying:  \n   \\[\n   1,200,000 - 120,000x = 0.4 \\times (2,280,000 - 120,000x)\n   \\]\n   Simplify the right side:  \n   \\[\n   1,200,000 - 120,000x = 912,000 - 48,000x\n   \\]\n   Rearranging terms:  \n   \\[\n   288,000 = 72,000x\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( x \\):  \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{288,000}{72,000} = 4\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   C joined \\( x = 4 \\) months after B. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: B**",
