      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where A can build a wall in 40 minutes and B can do it in 45 minutes. The question is asking how long it would take them to build the wall together. Hmm, I think this is a work rate problem. I remember that when two people are working together, their rates add up. \n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Work problems usually involve finding the combined rate. So, the formula I think is: 1/(1/a + 1/b) where a and b are the times each person takes individually. \n\nWait, right. Because the rates add. So A's rate is 1 wall per 40 minutes, which is 1/40 per minute. Similarly, B's rate is 1/45 per minute. Adding those together gives the combined rate. Then, the time taken together would be the reciprocal of that sum.\n\nSo let me calculate each step. \n\nFirst, A's rate: 1/40 per minute. B's rate: 1/45 per minute. So adding them: 1/40 + 1/45. To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. Let's see, 40 and 45. The least common multiple is 360, I think. Because 40 times 9 is 360, and 45 times 8 is 360.\n\nSo converting each fraction:\n\n1/40 = 9/360 and 1/45 = 8/360. Adding those together: 9/360 + 8/360 = 17/360. So their combined rate is 17/360 walls per minute.\n\nWait, wait. So the time it takes for them to build one wall together is 1 divided by (17/360), which is 360/17 minutes. Let me compute that. \n\n360 divided by 17. Let me do that division. 17 times 21 is 357 (because 17*20=340, plus 17 is 357). So 360 minus 357 is 3, so it's 21 and 3/17 minutes. \n\nHmm, 3/17 of a minute. To convert that to seconds, since 1 minute is 60 seconds, 3/17 *60 is approximately 10.588 seconds. So the total time is about 21 minutes and 10.588 seconds. \n\nLooking at the options, the choices are in minutes. The options are A)20, B)22, C)23, D)21, E)20. Wait, D is 21 minutes. But wait, I got 21 and 3/17 minutes, which is about 21.176 minutes. So it's just over 21 minutes, but the options don't have a 21.17 option. So the closest would be 21 minutes, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check my calculations again. Did I make a mistake in adding the rates?\n\nWait, 1/40 is 0.025, and 1/45 is approximately 0.0222. Adding them gives 0.047222... per minute. So the time is 1 / 0.047222. Let me compute that. \n\n1 divided by 0.047222. Let's see, 0.047222 is approximately 1/21.18. So 1 divided by that is 21.18 minutes, which aligns with my previous calculation. So 21.18 minutes is about 21 minutes and 11 seconds.\n\nLooking back at the options, the options are in whole minutes. So 21 minutes is option D. So that's the answer.\n",

So, for A, the rate would be 1 wall per 40 minutes. Similarly, B's rate is 1 wall per 45 minutes. But wait, I think I should express these as per minute to make it easier.\n\nLet me write that down. A's rate is 1/40 walls per minute, and B's rate is 1/45 walls per minute. So when they work together, their combined rate is (1/40 + 1/45) walls per minute. I need to add these two fractions.\n\nTo add them, I should find a common denominator. What's the least common multiple of 40 and 45? Let me think. 40 factors into 2^3 * 5, and 45 is 3^2 *5. So the LCM would be 2^3 *3^2 *5, which is 8*9*5. 8*9 is 72, 72*5 is 360. So the common denominator is 360.\n\nSo 1/40 is equal to 9/360 because 40*9=360. And 1/45 is 8/360 because 45*8=360. So adding them together gives 9/360 +8/360 =17/360. So their combined rate is 17/360 walls per minute.\n\nWait, but we need the time it takes to build one wall. So time is 1 divided by the rate.

Let me do the division.\n\n17 goes into 36 twice (2*17=34), remainder 2. Bring down the 0: 20. 17 into 20 once (17), rem 3. Bring down next 0: 30. 17 into 30 once (17), rem13. Next 0: 130. 17*7=119.
