      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about averages and trucks. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that the average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. Then, when a new heavy duty truck is added, the average increases by 2.6 tons. I need to find the weight of that truck.\n\nWait, averages can be a bit tricky, but I remember that the average is the total divided by the number of items. So, maybe I can start by calculating the total weight before and after adding the truck.\n\nFirst, the initial average is 12.2 tons for 10 vehicles. So the total weight must be 12.2 multiplied by 10. Let me calculate that. 12.2 * 10 is 122 tons. So the combined weight of the 10 vehicles is 122 tons.\n\nNow, when the new truck is added, the number of vehicles becomes 11. And the average increases by 2.6 tons. So the new average is 12.2 + 2.6. Let me add those: 12.2 plus 2.6 is 14.8 tons. So the new average is 14.8 tons for 11 vehicles.\n\nTo find the new total weight, I multiply 14.8 by 11. Hmm, what's 14.8 * 11? Let's see. 14 *11 is 154, and 0.8 *11 is 8.8, so adding those gives 154 +8.8 = 162.8 tons. So the total weight after adding the truck is 162.8 tons.\n\nWait, so the truck's weight must be the difference between the new total and the old total. So that's 162.8 - 122. Let me subtract that. 162.8 minus 122 is 40.8 tons. Oh, wait, but looking at the options, option A is 40.8. But wait, that seems a bit low for a heavy duty truck. Or maybe that's correct.\n\nWait a second, did I do that right? Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nInitial average: 12.2, 10 vehicles \u2192 122 total. New average: 12.2 +2.6 =14.8, 11 vehicles \u2192 14.8 *11= 162.8. So the truck's weight is 162.8 -122 =40.8. So that would be option A.\n\nBut wait, another way to approach this is by considering the change in total when adding the truck. The average increases by 2.6 for all 11 vehicles, not just the new one. So the total increase is 2.6 *11, which is 28.6 tons. So the truck must have added 28.6 tons more than the original average. Because adding it caused the average to go up by 2.6 for each of the 11 vehicles.\n\nWait, the original average was 12.2. The truck's weight is more than that, right? So the amount by which the truck exceeds the original average is what's causing the average to rise.\n\nSo, the truck's weight is equal to the original average plus the amount that increased the total by the necessary amount. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of how much the truck contributed to the new average.\n\nAlternatively, the total increase in weight is 2.6 tons times 11 vehicles, which is 28.6 tons. So the truck must be 12.2 (original average) plus 28.6. Because adding the truck's weight is 12.2 plus the extra needed to raise the average. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nThe total weight before adding the truck was 122. After adding, it's 162.8. So the truck's weight is 162.8 -122=40.8. So that's correct. So the answer is 40.8, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 41.6. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me recalculate the total after adding the truck.\n\n14.8 *11. Let's do it step by step. 14 *11 is 154. 0.8 *11 is 8.8. 154 +8.8 is 162.8. So that part is correct. Then 162.8 -122 is 40.8. So the correct answer must be A.\n\nBut why is option B 41.6? Maybe I messed up the initial average or the new average. Let me check the question again.\n\nThe average of 10 vehicles is 12.2. After adding a new vehicle, the average increases by 2.6. So new average is 12.2 +2.6=14.8. That seems right.\n\nWait another approach: the truck's weight must be equal to the new average plus the increase in average multiplied by the number of existing vehicles. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the truck's weight can be found by considering that it's equal to the new average plus the number of previous vehicles times the increase in average. Because the addition of the truck causes each of the 10 existing vehicles to effectively contribute an extra 2.6 tons towards the average. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, the formula for the new average is (Total + Truck) / (n+1) = new_avg.\n\nSo, Total + Truck = new_avg * (n+1).\n\nWe can rearrange this to find Truck = new_avg*(n+1) - Total.\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier. So Truck =14.8 *11 -12.2 *10 =162.8 -122=40.8. So that's correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is A)40.8.\n",

Then, when a new heavy duty truck is added, the average increases by 2.6 tons. I need to find the weight of that truck. The options are A to E, with some numbers around 40-44.8.\n\nWait, averages can be tricky, but I think I remember that average is total divided by the number of items. So maybe I can calculate the total weight before and after adding the truck.\n\nFirst, the initial average is 12.2 tons for 10 vehicles. So the total weight initially would be average multiplied by the number. Let me calculate that: 12.2 * 10. Hmm, 12 *10 is 120, and 0.2*10 is 2, so total is 122 tons.\n\nAfter adding the truck, the number of vehicles becomes 11. The average increases by 2.6 tons, so the new average is 12.2 + 2.6. Let me add that: 12 + 2 is 14, 0.2 + 0.6 is 0.8. So new average is 14.8 tons.\n\nNow, the total weight after adding the truck would be the new average multiplied by 11. So 14.8 * 11.

New average is 14.8, so 14.8 *11. Let me do 14.8 *10 =148, plus 14.8 is 162.8. Correct.\n\nSo 162.8 minus 122 is 40.8. That's option A.

So the truck must have added not just the increase but also the original average times the new vehicle. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the total increase in average is 2.6, and that's spread over 11 vehicles. So the truck must have contributed the increase for each of the 11 vehicles plus the original total. So the truck's weight is the original total plus 2.6 *11.\n\nWait, original total is 122. 2.6 *11 is 28.6. So 122 +28.6=150.6? No, that doesn't make sense because 122 is the original total.
