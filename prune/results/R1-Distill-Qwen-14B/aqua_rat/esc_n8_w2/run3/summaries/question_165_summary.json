      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and see what's going on.\n\nThe question says that Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake, and Karen works for 4 hours for the same purpose. The question is asking after how many hours they will be able to buy the cake together. The options are A to E, with numbers 1 to 5.\n\nHmm. So both Sharon and Karen are earning money through tips, and each of them individually needs a certain amount of time to earn enough for the cake. Now, if they work together, how much time would it take?\n\nWait, I think this is a problem about work rates. Like, how much each of them can contribute per hour, and then combining their rates to find the total.\n\nLet me think. If Sharon works 5 hours to earn enough, that means her rate is such that in 5 hours, she makes the total amount needed. Similarly, Karen's rate is such that in 4 hours, she makes the same amount.\n\nSo, let's denote the cost of the ice cream cake as C. Then, Sharon's hourly rate would be C divided by 5 hours. Similarly, Karen's rate is C divided by 4 hours. Because, you know, rate equals amount divided by time.\n\nSo Sharon's rate, R_s, is C/5 per hour. Karen's rate, R_k, is C/4 per hour.\n\nWhen they work together, their rates add up. So combined rate R_total is R_s + R_k = (C/5) + (C/4).\n\nLet me calculate that. To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 5 and 4 is 20.\n\nSo, C/5 is the same as 4C/20, and C/4 is 5C/20. Adding them together gives (4C + 5C)/20 = 9C/20.\n\nSo R_total is 9C/20 per hour. That means together, they earn 9C/20 of the cake's cost every hour.\n\nWait, but the total amount needed is C. So how long does it take for them to earn C together?\n\nTime is equal to amount divided by rate. So time T is C divided by (9C/20).\n\nLet me compute that. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So T = C * (20/(9C)).\n\nOh, wait, the C cancels out. So T = 20/9 hours.\n\nHmm, 20 divided by 9 is approximately 2.222... hours. Let me think, 20/9 is equal to 2 and 2/9 hours, which is about 2 hours and 13.33 minutes.\n\nBut the options are all whole numbers. So looking at the options, A is 1, B is 2, C is 3, D is4, E is5.\n\nWait, 20/9 is about 2.222, so it's a bit more than 2 hours. But none of the options are fractions. So I must have made a mistake here, because the options don't include 20/9.\n\nWait, maybe I approached this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nAnother way to approach this problem is to think about how much each of them contributes per hour, and then find the time when their combined contributions add up to 1 cake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as work rates where each is contributing to the same task.\n\nLet me try another angle. Suppose the total work required to buy the cake is 1 unit (like 1 cake). Sharon can do this in 5 hours, so her rate is 1/5 per hour. Karen can do this in 4 hours, so her rate is 1/4 per hour.\n\nWait, wait, no. That's not exactly right. Because in reality, Sharon and Karen are working to earn money, not directly working on the cake. So their rates are in terms of money earned, not the cake itself.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as the time they take to earn the required amount, so the problem is about how much each earns per hour, and how combining their earnings would let them reach the total amount faster.\n\nLet me think about it as money. Let's say the cost of the cake is X dollars. Sharon needs 5 hours to earn X dollars, so her rate is X/5 dollars per hour. Karen's rate is X/4 dollars per hour.\n\nWhen they work together, their combined rate is X/5 + X/4 dollars per hour.\n\nSo the total rate is (4X +5X)/20 = 9X/20 per hour.\n\nThe total amount needed is X. So time is X divided by (9X/20), which is 20/9 hours again. So same as before, about 2.222 hours.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that they're both trying to buy the same cake. So perhaps they can pool their money. So if Sharon has earned enough in 5 hours, and Karen in 4, but together, how much time do they need to have enough for one cake.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the time when the sum of the money they've earned equals the cake's cost.\n\nBut then I need to model it with variables.\n\nLet me define the cake's cost as C. Sharon's hourly wage is S = C/5. Karen's is K = C/4.\n\nIf they work together for t hours, the total money earned would be (S + K) * t. We need this to be >= C.\n\nSo (C/5 + C/4) * t >= C.\n\nFactor out C: [ (1/5 + 1/4) ] * t >= 1.\n\nCompute 1/5 + 1/4. That's 4/20 +5/20 =9/20.\n\nSo (9/20) * t >=1.\n\nMultiply both sides by 20/9: t >= 20/9 hours, which is approximately 2.222 hours.\n\nBut again, the options are all integers. So perhaps the problem is expecting us to round up to the next whole hour, so 3 hours.\n\nBecause 2 hours would give (9/20)*2= 18/20 = 0.9, which is less than 1. So they wouldn't have enough. 3 hours would give (9/20)*3=27/20=1.35, which is more than enough.\n\nSo the answer would be 3 hours, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5.\n\nSo if the exact time is 20/9 (~2.22), then after 2 hours, they have 18/20 = 0.9 of the cake's cost. So they don't have enough. So they need to work until 3 hours, which would get them 27/20, which is more than 1. So they can buy the cake after 3 hours.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the question is phrased as \"after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\" So maybe the exact time is 20/9, which is about 2.222 hours. But since you can't buy a fraction of an hour in real life, they have to wait until the full hour. So 3 hours would be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it in terms of their combined work rates. Wait, but I think I did that correctly.\n\nWait another approach: Let's assume the cake costs $20. It's a nice number because 5 and 4 go into it.\n\nSo if the cake is $20, Sharon makes $20 in 5 hours. So her rate is $4 per hour.\n\nKaren makes $20 in 4 hours. So her rate is $5 per hour.\n\nTogether, they make $4 + $5 = $9 per hour.\n\nSo together, how long does it take them to make $20? Time = 20 /9 \u2248 2.222 hours.\n\nBut since they can't work a fraction of an hour in this context (I mean, unless it's allowed), they need to work until the time when their earnings reach at least $20.\n\nSo in 2 hours, they make 9*2 = $18. Not enough.\n\nIn 3 hours, 9*3= $27, which is more than $20. So they can buy the cake after 3 hours.\n\nSo the answer is C) 3 hours.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nSharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake. Karen works for 4 hours to do the same. The question is, after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\n\nHmm. So both Sharon and Karen are trying to earn enough to buy the same ice cream cake. But the time each takes is different. I think I need to find out their individual rates of earning tips and then combine them to find the total time needed when working together.\n\nWait, right. So Sharon takes 5 hours alone, and Karen takes 4 hours alone. I guess their rates are in terms of the cake per hour. Like, Sharon's rate is 1 cake per 5 hours, and Karen's is 1 cake per 4 hours.\n\nBut wait, when they work together, their rates add up. So I think I can model this as a work rate problem. Like, how much of the cake they can earn per hour when working together.\n\nLet me think. Sharon's rate is 1/5 of the cake per hour. Karen's rate is 1/4 per hour. So together, their combined rate is 1/5 + 1/4.\n\nLet me calculate that. 1/5 is 0.2 and 1/4 is 0.25. Adding them gives 0.45. So together, they earn 0.45 of the cake per hour.\n\nWait, but wait. Actually, maybe I should think in terms of fractions to avoid decimal confusion. So 1/5 plus 1/4. The least common denominator is 20. So 4/20 +5/20 =9/20. So together, their combined rate is 9/20 of the cake per hour.\n\nNow, the question is, how long does it take for them to earn one whole cake together. So time equals total work divided by rate. The total work here is 1 cake.\n\nSo time = 1 / (9/20) = 20/9 hours. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 9 is approximately 2.222... hours, which is like 2 hours and 13.33 minutes.\n\nBut looking at the options, they're all whole numbers. So the options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Did I model the problem correctly? Because I assumed that the time each takes to earn the cake is their individual time. So Sharon's rate is 1 cake per 5 hours, Karen's is 1 per 4.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\" So when they work together, how much time is needed. So my calculation of 20/9 hours is correct, which is about 2.22 hours. So looking at the options, 2 hours is option B, and 3 hours is C. But 2.22 is closer to 2 than 3. So perhaps the answer is 3 hours, but wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, no, because 2 hours would give them 0.45 * 2 = 0.9 of the cake. Which is almost the whole cake but not quite. But since you can't buy a fraction of a cake, maybe they need to wait until they've earned enough. But in reality, they can accumulate the tips over time. So perhaps the calculation is correct, and the answer is 20/9, which is approximately 2.22 hours, so they would need to work together for about 2.22 hours.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as how much each contributes per hour and find when the sum equals 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching it wrong. Maybe the problem is about when their combined earnings reach the cost of the cake, but the way they earn is linear over time.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's say the cost of the ice cream cake is C dollars. Sharon earns enough in 5 hours, so her hourly rate is C/5 per hour. Karen earns C/4 per hour. So when they work together, their combined rate is (C/5 + C/4) per hour.\n\nSo the combined rate is (4C +5C)/(20) )=9C/20 per hour. So the time to earn C would be C divided by (9C/20) )=20/9 hours, which is about 2.22 hours.\n\nSo again, same result. The options don't have that. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of hours they need to work together to each earn enough, but that doesn't make much sense. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: Sharon works 5 hours to earn enough to buy the cake. Karen works 4 hours to earn enough. So together, how long will it take for them to earn enough.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about when their combined earnings sum to the price of the cake. So each of them is earning money, and together their tips add up. So if the cake costs, say, X, Sharon's rate is X/5 per hour. Karen's is X/4 per hour. So together, their combined rate is X/5 + X/4.\n\nSo the total amount earned per hour together is (X/5 + X/4) = (4X +5X)/20 =9X/20.\n\nSo the time to earn X dollars is X / (9X/20) )=20/9 hours, which is about 2.222 hours, which is 2 and 2/9 hours, which is about 2 hours and 13 minutes.\n\nBut none of the options is 2.222. The options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5.\n\nHmm. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the question is when their combined earnings reach the price of the cake when each works for the same amount of time.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a different approach. Let me think. Let me denote the time they work together as t hours.\n\nSharon's contribution would be (t/5) cakes, because she can earn a whole cake in 5 hours. Similarly, Karen's contribution is (t/4) cakes. Together, their combined contribution is (t/5 + t/4) cakes.\n\nWe want this sum to be >=1 cake.\n\nSo, t/5 + t/4 >=1.\n\nLet me solve for t.\n\nMultiply both sides by 20 to eliminate denominators: 4t +5t >=20 \u21929t >=20 \u2192t>=20/9 \u22482.222 hours.\n\nSo again, same result.\n\nBut the options are all integers. So perhaps the answer is 3 hours, because at 2 hours, they would have t=2. So 2/5 +2/4= 0.4 + 0.5=0.9. Less than 1. So not enough. So they need more than 2 hours. So the next option is 3 hours.\n\nWait, but the options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5.\n\nSo the correct answer would be 20/9 \u22482.22 hours. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the intended answer is 3 hours. But wait, wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. The way it's written: Sharon works 5 hours to earn enough to buy the cake. So her rate is enough to buy the cake in 5 hours. Similarly, Karen can earn enough in 4 hours.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as their combined rates and find when together their rates add up to the required amount.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about how much each can contribute per hour, and together, how long until their combined savings equal the price of the cake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the problem in terms of the least common multiple or something else.\n\nWait, let me think in terms of the amount they earn per hour.\n\nLet me assign variables. Let the total cost of the cake be C.\n\nSharon's hourly rate is C/5.\n\nKaren's hourly rate is C/4.\n\nWhen they work together, their combined rate is C/5 + C/4 = (4C +5C)/20 =9C/20 per hour.\n\nSo the time required is C divided by (9C/20) )= 20/9 hours \u22482.222 hours.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is intended to be solved differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about how much each earns per hour, and when their combined earnings sum to the price.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about how much each person contributes to the purchase when working together for t hours.\n\nSo Sharon earns (C/5)*t per hour, and Karen (C/4)*t per hour. Together, their combined earnings after t hours would be (C/5 + C/4) *t = (9C/20)*t. We need this to be equal to C (the price of the cake). So (9C/20)*t =C \u2192 t=20/9.\n\nAgain, same result. So 20/9 is about 2.222 hours. So the answer should be approximately 2.22 hours. But none of the options match.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is not about the combined earnings, but about each contributing enough individually, but that doesn't make sense. Because the question says, \"after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\" So it's about their combined effort.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that when they work together, each works for the same amount of time, and their individual earnings add up. So if they each work t hours, Sharon's contribution is t/5 of the cake, and Karen's is t/4. So together, t/5 + t/4 >=1.\n\nWait, that's exactly what I did earlier. So t>=20/9.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is 3 hours, which is the next whole number after 2.22.\n\nBut wait, the options are 1,2,3,4,5. So 3 hours would be the answer, but wait, let's see: in 3 hours, Sharon would have earned 3/5 =0.6, Karen 3/4=0.75. Together, 1.35, which is more than enough. But the question is about when they can buy the cake. So perhaps the minimal t where their combined earnings are >=1.\n\nSo the minimal t is 20/9 hours, which is approximately 2.22 hours. So the options don't have that, but perhaps the intended answer is 3 hours.\n\nWait, but let's check. If they work together for 2 hours, Sharon contributes 2/5 =0.4, Karen 2/4=0.5. Sum is 0.9 <1. So not enough. So after 2 hours, they can't buy it. After 3 hours, sum is 0.6+0.75=1.35>1. So they can buy it.\n\nSo the minimal integer value of t where they can buy the cake is 3 hours. So the answer would be C)3 hours.\n\nBut wait, the options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5. So the correct answer is C.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the exact time is 2.22 hours, but since the options don't include fractions, perhaps the intended answer is 3 hours.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the problem is about how much each can contribute per hour, and together, how long until the sum of their contributions equals the cost.\n\nWait, but that's the same as I did before. So perhaps the answer is 20/9, which is approximately 2.22, but since the options don't have that, the answer must be 3 hours.\n\nWait, but let me think about the problem statement again. It says Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake. So her rate is such that in 5 hours, she earns the amount needed for the cake. Similarly, Karen in 4 hours.\n\nSo, when they work together, their rates add up. So the time taken is 1/(1/5 +1/4) )=20/9 hours.\n\nBut since the options don't have that, perhaps the answer is not among the options. But the options are provided, so I must choose from them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is intended to be solved by adding their individual times and finding a common multiple. But that doesn't make sense, because when working together, the time should be less than the shorter individual time. Wait, no, when working together, the time is less than either individual time, because their combined effort is faster. So the correct time is 20/9 (~2.22), which is less than both 4 and 5 hours.\n\nSo looking at the options, the closest higher integer is 3, which is option C.\n\nSo I think the answer is C)3 hours.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nSharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake. Karen works for 4 hours to do the same. The question is, after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\n\nHmm. So both Sharon and Karen are trying to earn enough to buy the same ice cream cake. But the time each takes is different. I think I need to find out their individual rates of earning tips and then combine them to find the total time needed when working together.\n\nWait, right. So Sharon takes 5 hours alone, and Karen takes 4 hours alone. I guess their rates are in terms of the cake per hour. Like, Sharon's rate is 1 cake per 5 hours, and Karen's is 1 cake per 4 hours.\n\nBut wait, when they work together, their rates add up. So I think I can model this as a work rate problem. Like, how much of the cake they can earn per hour when working together.\n\nLet me think. Sharon's rate is 1/5 of the cake per hour. Karen's rate is 1/4 per hour. So together, their combined rate is 1/5 + 1/4.\n\nLet me calculate that. 1/5 is 0.2 and 1/4 is 0.25. Adding them gives 0.45. So together, they earn 0.45 of the cake per hour.\n\nWait, but wait. Actually, maybe I should think in terms of fractions to avoid decimal confusion. So 1/5 plus 1/4. The least common denominator is 20. So 4/20 +5/20 =9/20. So together, their combined rate is 9/20 of the cake per hour.\n\nNow, the question is, how long does it take for them to earn one whole cake together. So time equals total work divided by rate. The total work here is 1 cake.\n\nSo time = 1 / (9/20) = 20/9 hours. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 9 is approximately 2.222... hours, which is like 2 hours and 13.33 minutes.\n\nBut looking at the options, they're all whole numbers. So the options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Did I model the problem correctly? Because I assumed that the time each takes to earn the cake is their individual time. So Sharon's rate is 1 cake per 5 hours, Karen's is 1 per 4.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\" So when they work together, how much time is needed. So my calculation of 20/9 hours is correct, which is about 2.22 hours. So looking at the options, 2 hours is option B, and 3 hours is C. But 2.22 is closer to 2 than 3. So perhaps the answer is 3 hours, but wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, no, because 2 hours would give them 0.45 * 2 = 0.9 of the cake. Which is almost the whole cake but not quite. But since you can't buy a fraction of a cake, maybe they need to wait until they've earned enough. But in reality, they can accumulate the tips over time. So perhaps the calculation is correct, and the answer is 20/9, which is approximately 2.22 hours, so they would need to work together for about 2.22 hours.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as how much each contributes per hour and find when the sum equals 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching it wrong. Maybe the problem is about when their combined earnings reach the cost of the cake, but the way they earn is linear over time.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's say the cost of the ice cream cake is C dollars. Sharon earns enough in 5 hours, so her hourly rate is C/5 per hour. Karen earns C/4 per hour. So when they work together, their combined rate is (C/5 + C/4) per hour.\n\nSo the combined rate is (4C +5C)/(20) )=9C/20 per hour. So the time to earn C would be C divided by (9C/20) )=20/9 hours, which is about 2.22 hours.\n\nSo again, same result. The options don't have that. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of hours they need to work together to each earn enough, but that doesn't make much sense. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: Sharon works 5 hours to earn enough to buy the cake. Karen works 4 hours to earn enough. So together, how long will it take for them to earn enough.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about when their combined earnings sum to the price of the cake. So each of them is earning money, and together their tips add up. So if the cake costs, say, X, Sharon's rate is X/5 per hour. Karen's is X/4 per hour. So together, their combined rate is X/5 + X/4.\n\nSo the total amount earned per hour together is (X/5 + X/4) = (4X +5X)/20 =9X/20.\n\nSo the time to earn X dollars is X / (9X/20) )=20/9 hours, which is about 2.222 hours, which is 2 and 2/9 hours, which is about 2 hours and 13 minutes.\n\nBut none of the options is 2.222. The options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5.\n\nHmm. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the question is when their combined earnings reach the price of the cake when each works for the same amount of time.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a different approach. Let me think. Let me denote the time they work together as t hours.\n\nSharon's contribution would be (t/5) cakes, because she can earn a whole cake in 5 hours. Similarly, Karen's contribution is (t/4) cakes. Together, their combined contribution is (t/5 + t/4) cakes.\n\nWe want this sum to be >=1 cake.\n\nSo, t/5 + t/4 >=1.\n\nLet me solve for t.\n\nMultiply both sides by 20 to eliminate denominators: 4t +5t >=20 \u21929t >=20 \u2192t>=20/9 \u22482.222 hours.\n\nSo again, same result.\n\nBut the options are all integers. So perhaps the answer is 3 hours, because at 2 hours, they would have t=2. So 2/5 +2/4= 0.4 + 0.5=0.9. Less than 1. So not enough. So they need more than 2 hours. So the next option is 3 hours.\n\nWait, but the options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5.\n\nSo the correct answer would be 20/9 \u22482.22 hours. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the intended answer is 3 hours. But wait, wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. The way it's written: Sharon works 5 hours to earn enough to buy the cake. So her rate is enough to buy the cake in 5 hours. Similarly, Karen can earn enough in 4 hours.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as their combined rates and find when together their rates add up to the required amount.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about how much each can contribute per hour, and together, how long until their combined savings equal the price of the cake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the problem in terms of the least common multiple or something else.\n\nWait, let me think in terms of the amount they earn per hour.\n\nLet me assign variables. Let the total cost of the cake be C.\n\nSharon's hourly rate is C/5.\n\nKaren's hourly rate is C/4.\n\nWhen they work together, their combined rate is C/5 + C/4 = (4C +5C)/20 =9C/20 per hour.\n\nSo the time required is C divided by (9C/20) )= 20/9 hours \u22482.222 hours.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is intended to be solved differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about how much each earns per hour, and when their combined earnings sum to the price.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about how much each person contributes to the purchase when working together for t hours.\n\nSo Sharon earns (C/5)*t per hour, and Karen (C/4)*t per hour. Together, their combined earnings after t hours would be (C/5 + C/4) *t = (9C/20)*t. We need this to be equal to C (the price of the cake). So (9C/20)*t =C \u2192 t=20/9.\n\nAgain, same result. So 20/9 is about 2.222 hours. So the answer should be approximately 2.22 hours. But none of the options match.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is not about the combined earnings, but about each contributing enough individually, but that doesn't make sense.

So t>=20/9.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is 3 hours, which is the next whole number after 2.22.\n\nBut wait, the options are 1,2,3,4,5. So 3 hours would be the answer, but wait, let's see: in 3 hours, Sharon would have earned 3/5 =0.6, Karen 3/4=0.75. Together, 1.35, which is more than enough. But the question is about when they can buy the cake. So perhaps the minimal t where their combined earnings are >=1.\n\nSo the minimal t is 20/9 hours, which is approximately 2.22 hours. So the options don't have that, but perhaps the intended answer is 3 hours.\n\nWait, but let's check. If they work together for 2 hours, Sharon contributes 2/5 =0.4, Karen 2/4=0.5. Sum is 0.9 <1. So not enough. So after 2 hours, they can't buy it. After 3 hours, sum is 0.6+0.75=1.35>1. So they can buy it.\n\nSo the minimal integer value of t where they can buy the cake is 3 hours. So the answer would be C)3 hours.\n\nBut wait, the options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5.
