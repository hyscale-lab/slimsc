      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about a salesperson who gets a 10% commission on each sale. They need to find out how many sales of $250 each are required for the salesperson to reach a salary of at least $1000. The options are A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52.\n\nHmm, right. So the key here is to calculate the number of sales needed so that the total commission is at least $1000. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, each sale is $250, and the commission is 10% on each. So for each sale, the salesperson earns 10% of $250. Let me compute that. 10% of 250 is 0.10 * 250, which is $25 per sale.\n\nWait, wait. So each sale gives them $25. Now, they need to reach a salary of at least $1000. So the total commission must be >= $1000. So, how many sales (let's call the number 'x') multiplied by $25 per sale should be equal to or more than $1000.\n\nSo the equation is 25 * x >= 1000.\n\nTo find x, I can rearrange this. Divide both sides by 25: x >= 1000 / 25.\n\nWhat's 1000 divided by 25? Let me think. 25 times 40 is 1000. So x >= 40. Wait, that's not right. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 25 times 40 is 1000. So 40 sales would give exactly $1000. But the question says 'at least' $1000, so 40 would be the minimum number of sales needed.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 40. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check. 40 sales times $250 each is 40 * 250 = $10,000 in sales. The commission is 10%, so 10% of 10,000 is $1000. That's exactly the target. So yes, 40 sales would give exactly $1000. Since the question says 'at least' $1000, 40 is the correct number. So the answer is D.\n",

And he wants to make at least $1000. How many sales does he need to make?\n\nAlright, let's break it down. So the commission is 10%, which is like 0.1 in decimal. Each sale is $250, so for each sale, the commission would be 10% of 250. Let me calculate that: 0.1 * 250 is 25. So each sale gives him $25.\n\nNow, he wants to reach at least $1000. So I need to find out how many times he needs to make $25 to reach $1000. Oh right, so that's like dividing 1000 by 25. Let me do that math. 1000 divided by 25. Hmm, 25 times 40 is 1000, right? Because 25*40 is 1000. So that would mean he needs to make 40 sales.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Each sale is $250, 10% is $25. So per sale, he gets $25. To get to $1000, how many times does 25 go into 1000? 1000 /25 is 40. So 40 sales. So looking at the options, D is 40. So the answer should be D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set up an equation to be thorough. Let the number of sales be x. Then, the total commission is 0.1 * 250 * x. So 0.1 *250 is 25, as before. So 25x = 1000. Solving for x, x=1000/25=40. Yep, same answer. So definitely 40 sales, which is option D.\n",
