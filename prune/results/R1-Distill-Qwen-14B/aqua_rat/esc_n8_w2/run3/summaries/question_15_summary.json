Oh, maybe it's a typo because \"PROBLEM\" is a common word, but \"PROBLEC\" would be a different word. Oh well, maybe it's correct as given. So the word is \"PROBLEC\".\n\nThe question is asking how many ways the letters can be rearranged to make 7-letter words with no repeating letters. The options are A) 2!, B)3!, C)7!, D)8!, E)9!.\n\nWait, so the word \"PROBLEC\" has how many letters? Let's see: P, R, O, B, L, E, C. That's 7 letters. So all the letters are unique, right? So if all letters are unique, then the number of permutations would be 7 factorial, which is 7!.\n\nWait, but wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, the word is \"PROBLEM\" perhaps? Because \"PROBLEM\" is a common word with 7 letters. But the question says \"PROBLEC\". Let me count the letters in \"PROBLEC\". P-R-O-B-L-E-C: that's 7 letters. So all letters are distinct. So the number of rearrangements is 7!.\n\nSo the options are given, and option C is 7!, which would be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Are there any duplicate letters in \"PROBLEM\"? No, each letter is unique. So the number of possible rearrangements is indeed 7!.\n\nLooking at the options: option C is 7!, so the answer should be C.\n",

Wait, no, the question says the word is \"PROBLEM\". Or is it \"PROBLEM\"? Wait, let me read the question again.\n\nWait, the question says: \"In how many ways can the letters of the word 'PROBLEM' be rearranged...\" So the word is \"PROBLEM\". Wait, but \"PROBLEM\" has how many letters? Let me count: P-R-O-B-L-E-M. That's 7 letters. Oh, right, so the word is 7 letters long, each appearing once, so all unique letters. So when the question says rearranged into 7-letter words with no letters repeating, that's the same as finding the number of permutations of 7 distinct letters.\n\nWait, but wait, the options include 7! and 8! and others. So 7! is 5040. But wait, the word \"PROBLEM\"\u2014is that 7 letters? Let me count again. P, R, O, B, L, E, M. Yep, seven letters.\n\nSo the number of ways to rearrange all 7 letters without repetition is 7 factorial. Because each position in the word can be filled by any of the remaining letters. So the first letter has 7 choices, the next 6, and so on until 1. So that's 7! which is 5040.\n\nWait, but let me check the options.
