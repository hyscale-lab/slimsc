      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here. Let me read it again. It says that A and B are independent events, with P(A) equal to 0.2 and P(B) equal to 0.8. I need to find P(A/B), which I think is the probability of A given B. Right, so conditional probability.\n\nWait, I remember that for independent events, the occurrence of one doesn't affect the probability of the other. So if A and B are independent, then knowing that B happened shouldn't change the probability of A happening. That makes sense because independence is all about having no influence on each other.\n\nSo, the formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B). But since A and B are independent, P(A \u2229 B) is just P(A) multiplied by P(B), right? Because for independent events, the joint probability is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo substituting in the values, P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16. Then, P(A|B) would be 0.16 divided by P(B), which is 0.8. Let me calculate that: 0.16 / 0.8 is 0.2. So the probability is 0.2.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 0.2. So that should be the correct answer. Wait, did I do everything right? Let me double-check. Independent events, so the conditional probability should equal the individual probability. Oh right! Because if they're independent, P(A|B) = P(A). So 0.2 is definitely the right choice.\n",
