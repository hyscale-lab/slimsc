      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. I need to figure out which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. The options are A to E, each combining these statements differently.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, if a number N has a prime factorization of N = p\u2081^a * p\u2082^b * ... * p\u2099^k, then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)...(k+1). So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nSo Q has 5 factors. Hmm, 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. That means the exponents in the prime factorization of Q must be such that when each is increased by one and multiplied, the result is 5. Since 5 is prime, the only possibility is that the number of exponents is 4 in one prime. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If the product is 5, and 5 is a prime, then the only way is one term in the product. So that would mean that the number of exponents plus one is 5. So the exponent would be 4. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the number of factors is (exponent + 1) for each prime. So if it's a single prime, then Q would be p^4, because 4+1=5. Alternatively, could there be more than one prime? Let's see: for two primes, the exponents would have to multiply to 5, but 5 is prime, so only possibility is (5) = (4+1). So if you have two primes, their exponents plus one would have to multiply to 5. So one prime has exponent 4, and the other has exponent 0, but wait, exponent can't be zero because that would mean it's not part of the prime factors. Wait, no, actually, if a prime has exponent zero, it's not included. So maybe it's just one prime with exponent 4.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If you have two primes, then (a+1)(b+1) =5. Since 5 is prime, one of (a+1) or (b+1) must be 1, but that would mean a=0 or b=0. So that would reduce it to a single prime. So that can't happen. So the only possible case is that Q is a single prime raised to the 4th power. So Q = p^4, where p is prime.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. No, wait! Wait, 5 factors. Let me list the number of factors for some numbers. For example, 16 is 2^4. Its factors are 1,2,4,8,16. So that's 5 factors. Yes. What about 12? 12 is 2^2 *3^1. So number of factors is (2+1)(1+1)=3*2=6. So more than 5. So if Q has 5 factors, it must be the fourth power of a prime. So that would make statement II true, because statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Wait, if Q is p^4, then it's the square of p squared. So p squared is (p\u00b2)^2. Wait, no, p squared is p\u00b2, which is different. So if Q is p^4, then it's the square of p\u00b2, but p is a prime. So the square of a prime would be p\u00b2, which has (2+1) =3 factors. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime, which would mean Q=p\u00b2. But in our case, Q=p^4, so statement I would be false. So statement I is not necessarily true.\n\nWait, but wait again. Let me think. If Q is p^4, then Q is the square of p squared, which is (p\u00b2)^2. So p squared is a prime squared, which is a square of a prime. So is Q the square of a prime? No, because p squared is a prime squared, but Q is (p squared) squared, which is p^4. So Q is the square of a prime squared. So is that considered the square of a prime? No, because the prime is p squared, which is not a prime. Because p is a prime, p squared is composite unless p=2, then p squared is 4, which is composite. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then Q is (p\u00b2)^2, but p\u00b2 is not a prime. So statement I is not correct. So statement I is false. So statement I is not necessarily true.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. If Q is the square of a prime, say p\u00b2, then the number of factors would be 3 (1, p, p\u00b2). So that's 3 factors, not 5. So statement I can't be correct because that would only give 3 factors, but Q has 5. So statement I is not true.\n\nStatement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. As we saw, Q=p^4, which gives 5 factors, so that's correct. So statement II is true.\n\nWhat about statement III? It says Q is the product of two primes. So if Q were the product of two distinct primes, say p and q, then Q=p*q. The number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. So four factors. But Q has 5, which is more than 4. So that's not possible. Alternatively, if the product is of the same prime, like p^2, but that's just one prime squared, which would have 3 factors. So statement III is not correct either.\n\nWait, but wait another angle. Could Q be the product of two primes where one is squared, like p^2 * q^1? Then the number of factors would be (2+1)(1+1)=3*2=6, which is more than 5. So no, that's not possible. So statement III is false.\n\nWait, but wait. So in this case, Q must be p^4, which is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II is correct. So looking at the options, the only correct statement is II. So the options are:\n\nA) I only \u2192 incorrect because I is false.\n\nB) III only \u2192 incorrect because III is false.\n\nC) II only \u2192 yes, correct.\n\nD) I and II only \u2192 no, because I is false.\n\nE) I and III only \u2192 no, both are false.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C, which is II only.\n",

So III is incorrect.\n\nSo only statement II is correct. So the answer is option C.\n\nWait, but in the options, option C is II only. So the correct answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine which statements about \\( Q \\) must be true, we analyze the number of factors \\( Q \\) has. The number of factors of a positive integer is determined by its prime factorization. If \\( Q \\) has exactly 5 factors, we use the formula for the number of factors: if \\( Q = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\dots p_n^{a_n} \\), then the number of factors is \\( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\dots (a_n + 1) \\). Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is \\( 5 = 5 \\times 1 \\). This implies that \\( Q \\) must be of the form \\( p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number.\n\nNow, we evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Statement I**: \\( Q \\) is the square of a prime number.  \n   If \\( Q = p^2 \\), the number of factors would be \\( 2 + 1 = 3 \\), which is insufficient since \\( Q \\) must have 5 factors. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Statement II**: \\( Q \\) is the fourth power of a prime number.  \n   If \\( Q = p^4 \\), the number of factors is \\( 4 + 1 = 5 \\), which matches the requirement. This statement is true.\n\n3. **Statement III**: \\( Q \\) is the product of two prime numbers.  \n   If \\( Q = p \\times q \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes, the number of factors is \\( (1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \\), which is insufficient. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nFrom this analysis, only Statement II is true. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: C",
