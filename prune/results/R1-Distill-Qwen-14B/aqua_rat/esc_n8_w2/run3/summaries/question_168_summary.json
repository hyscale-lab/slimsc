      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two ants moving towards each other. Let me think about how to solve it. Hmm, the question is asking for the distance that ant A travels until they meet.\n\nAlright, let's break down the information. Ant A's speed is 9 cm per hour, and ant B's speed is 6 cm per hour. The farms are 75 cm apart. So they start moving towards each other, and we need to find out how far ant A goes before they meet.\n\nWait, right. When two objects move towards each other, their speeds add up because they're approaching each other. So the combined speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So that would be 9 + 6 = 15 cm per hour. Oh wait, no, wait. Oh no, wait, wait, wait. No, wait. No, wait a second. Oh, no, that's right. Because when they move towards each other, the time until they meet depends on their combined speed. So yeah, the combined speed is 15 cm/hour.\n\nSo the total distance between them is 75 cm. So the time it takes for them to meet would be the total distance divided by their combined speed. So time = 75 cm / 15 cm per hour. Let me calculate that: 75 divided by 15 is 5. So time is 5 hours.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, no. Wait, that can't be right. Because 15 cm/hour times 5 hours is 75 cm. Oh, right, so that makes sense. So they meet after 5 hours.\n\nBut wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. No, wait. No, wait. No, that's correct. Because each hour, the distance between them decreases by 15 cm. So in 1 hour, 15 cm gone. 5 hours would cover 75 cm. So yes, they meet after 5 hours.\n\nNow, the question is how far does ant A travel in that time. Ant A's speed is 9 cm/hour, so distance is speed multiplied by time. So 9 * 5 = 45 cm. Oh wait, so that's 45 cm. Looking at the options, option A is 45. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because sometimes when I'm tired, I might miscalculate. So let's recalculate. Total distance is 75 cm. Combined speed is 9 +6 =15. Time is 75/15=5 hours. Ant A's distance is 9 *5=45. So yes, 45 cm. So option A is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Oh, wait, wait. Oh no! Wait, wait. No, wait. Oh no, wait. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the options are given, and option A is 45, which is what I got, but let me think about another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the ratio of their speeds. Ant A is faster than ant B. So the distance each travels would be proportional to their speeds. Because when moving towards each other, the time is the same for both. So the distance each covers is speed multiplied by time. So the ratio of distances is the same as the ratio of their speeds.\n\nSo the ratio of Ant A's speed to Ant B's speed is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. So the total distance is 75 cm, and the parts are in the ratio 3:2. So the total parts are 3+2=5. Each part is 75/5=15 cm. So Ant A travels 3 parts: 3*15=45 cm. Yep, same answer. So it's definitely 45 cm. So the correct option is A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B, we start by calculating their combined speed. Since they are moving towards each other, their speeds add up:  \n\\[\n\\text{Combined speed} = 9 \\, \\text{cm/hour} + 6 \\, \\text{cm/hour} = 15 \\, \\text{cm/hour}.\n\\]\n\nThe total distance between the farms is 75 cm.

Since ant A's speed is 9 cm/hour, the distance it travels is:  \n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = 9 \\, \\text{cm/hour} \\times 5 \\, \\text{hours} = 45 \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]\n\nTo confirm, we can also use the ratio of their speeds. The ratio of ant A's speed to ant B's speed is \\(9:6 = 3:2\\). The total distance (75 cm) is divided in the ratio \\(3:2\\). Each part corresponds to:  \n\\[\n\\frac{75 \\, \\text{cm}}{3 + 2} = 15 \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]\nThus, ant A travels \\(3 \\times 15 \\, \\text{cm} = 45 \\, \\text{cm}\\).\n\nBoth methods confirm that ant A travels 45 cm before meeting ant B.
