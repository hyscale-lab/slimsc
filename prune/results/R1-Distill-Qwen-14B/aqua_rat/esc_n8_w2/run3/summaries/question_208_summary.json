      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quadratic equation problem to solve. The question is asking for the largest integer value of 'k' such that the equation x\u00b2 -5x + k = 0 has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, I remember that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant determines the nature of the roots. The discriminant is given by b\u00b2 - 4ac.\n\nRight, the discriminant tells us if there are two real roots, one real root, or two complex roots. For two real and distinct roots, the discriminant should be positive. So I need to set up the condition that the discriminant is greater than zero.\n\nIn this equation, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. So plugging into the discriminant formula: discriminant = (-5)\u00b2 - 4*(1)*(k). That simplifies to 25 -4k. \n\nWait, so for two distinct real roots, 25 -4k > 0. Let me write that down: 25 -4k > 0. Solving for k, I can rearrange this inequality. Subtract 25 from both sides: -4k > -25. Then, divide both sides by -4. But wait, I remember that when you divide or multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So dividing both sides by -4, the inequality becomes k < 25/4.\n\n25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. But the question is asking for the largest integer value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 would be 6, right?\n\nWait, but looking at the options given: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm, none of these are 6. Did I do something wrong here?\n\nWait, let me double-check. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. So (-5)^2 is 25, 4ac is 4*1*k, so 4k. So 25 -4k >0. So yes, 25>4k => 4k <25 => k <6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer k is 6. But wait, the options don't include 6. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, looking at the options again: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm. None of these are 6, so perhaps I misread the problem. Oh wait, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. Maybe I swapped a or c? No, a is 1, b is -5, c is k. So discriminant is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about integral values, but perhaps the options are wrong? Or maybe I miscalculated something.\n\nWait, maybe the equation is written differently. Let me see: x squared minus 5x plus k. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo according to my calculation, k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But since 6 isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the equation is x squared plus 5x plus k? No, the question says minus 5x. Hmm. So that's not it.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the largest integer k where the equation has two real and distinct roots. So maybe I should check each option to see which is the largest that satisfies k <6.25.\n\nLooking at the options: the options are 9,7,3,8,12. So the largest of these that is less than 6.25 is none. Because all of them are larger than 6.25 except 3. So the largest is 3. So the correct answer would be C)3. But wait, that can't be right because 3 is much smaller than 6.25. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant.\n\nWait another approach. Let me calculate the discriminant for each option and see if it's positive.\n\nOption A: k=9. Discriminant is 25 -4*1*9=25-36= -11. Negative, so no real roots. So A is out.\n\nOption B: k=7. Discriminant 25-28= -3. Also negative. So B is out.\n\nOption C: k=3. 25-12=13>0. So yes, two distinct real roots. But is 3 the largest possible k? Because 6.25 is higher, but the options don't have 6, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, wait a second. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant formula. Let me re-calculate: discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. So in the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) =25 -4k. So that part was correct.\n\nSo if k is 6, then discriminant is 25-24=1>0. So 6 is acceptable. But since 6 is not an option, perhaps the correct approach is to choose the largest k in the options that is less than 6.25. The options given are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So among these, the only one less than 6.25 is C)3. So the largest possible is 3. But wait, that seems odd because 3 is much lower than 6.25.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Wait, another thought: perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k, which would change the discriminant. Let me check. If the equation were x\u00b2 +5x +k=0, then discriminant would be 25 -4k. So same as before. So no, that's not the issue.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to find the smallest possible k? No, the question says the largest. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about whether the roots are integers, but that's not what the question is asking. It's about real and distinct roots.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is written incorrectly, or the options are wrong. Because according to my calculation, the largest integer k is 6, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait another approach: Let me think about the quadratic equation. The roots are real and distinct when the discriminant is positive. So for the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, discriminant D=25 -4k>0. So 25>4k => k <6.25.\n\nSo possible integer k values are 6,5,4,3,2,1,0,-1 etc. So the largest is 6.\n\nBut since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the question was meant to have a different coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the equation. Let me check again: the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So yes, a=1, b=-5, c=k.\n\nHmm. So in the options, the only k that is less than 6.25 is 3 (option C). But that seems to be the only option that fits, but it's the smallest, not the largest.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are presented incorrectly. Let me see the options again: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So all options are above 6 except C)3. So according to that, the correct answer is C)3. But that can't be the largest, it's the smallest.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the discriminant.\n\nWait, another thought: what if the equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but I misapplied the discriminant formula. Let me recalculate: discriminant is b\u00b2-4ac. So b is -5, so b\u00b2 is 25. 4ac is 4*1*k =4k. So discriminant is 25-4k. So yes, correct.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the largest k where the equation has two real roots, not necessarily distinct. But no, the question says 'two real and distinct roots', which requires discriminant>0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that perhaps the options are presented as 9,7,3,8,12, and I have to pick the largest possible k that is less than 6.25. The options don't have any number between 3 and 9 except 3. So the only option less than 6.25 is 3. Therefore, the correct answer is option C)3.\n\nWait, but that seems odd because 3 is much less than 6.25. So why would the options not include 6,5, etc. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me see what happens then. Discriminant would be 25 -4k. Same condition, k <6.25. So same result. So no difference.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k=0, which would make c=-k. Then discriminant would be 25 -4*(-k) =25+4k. For this to be positive, 25+4k>0. So 4k> -25 =>k> -6.25. So any k greater than -6.25 would work. But that's a different condition. But the equation in the problem is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, so I don't think that's the case.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is looking for the maximum value of k for which the equation has two real roots, which is when discriminant is zero. Wait, no. When discriminant is zero, the equation has exactly one real root (a repeated root). So for two distinct roots, it must be positive.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the question again. It says 'largest integral value of k'. So if the maximum allowed k is 6.25, then the largest integer is 6. But 6 is not an option, so perhaps the options have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me recalculate that scenario. Discriminant is 25-4k. So same as before. So k must be less than 6.25. So same conclusion.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is 5x\u00b2 -x +k=0. Then a=5, b=-1, c=k. Then discriminant would be (-1)^2 -4*5*k =1-20k>0. So 1>20k =>k<1/20. So maximum integer k would be 0. But that's not among the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, and the question is about the roots being real and distinct, but perhaps I've mixed up the inequality. Let me think again: discriminant must be positive, so 25-4k>0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192k<6.25.\n\nSo with the options given, only option C)3 is less than 6.25. So the correct answer must be option C.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because 3 is much smaller than 6.25. So why is it the largest? Oh wait, because the other options are all larger than 6.25, which would make the discriminant negative, leading to no real roots.\n\nSo in the given options, the only k that allows real and distinct roots is 3. Hence, the largest possible k in the options is 3.\n\nWait, but that seems odd. Let me check with k=3: equation is x\u00b2-5x +3=0. Discriminant is 25-12=13>0. So yes, two real roots.\n\nIf I take k=7, which is option B, then discriminant is 25-28=-3<0. No real roots. Similarly, k=9 (option A) gives discriminant -11, no real roots. Option D, k=8: 25-32= -7<0. E)12: 25-48=-23<0.\n\nOnly option C (k=3) gives a positive discriminant. So it's the only one that works. Therefore, the largest integral value of k among the options is 3. So the answer is C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation problem here, and I need to find the largest integer value of 'k' such that the equation has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, let's see. I remember that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant determines the nature of the roots.\n\nWait, the discriminant is b\u00b2 - 4ac, right? So, if the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, one real root, and if negative, complex roots. So in this case, I need the discriminant to be greater than zero.\n\nThe given equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Comparing this to ax\u00b2 +bx +c, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. So the discriminant D would be (-5)^2 -4*(1)*k. That simplifies to 25 -4k.\n\nOh wait, right. So for two real and distinct roots, D must be greater than zero. So 25 -4k > 0. Let me solve this inequality.\n\n25 -4k >0 \u2192 subtract 25 from both sides: -4k > -25. Then I need to divide both sides by -4. Wait, but when I divide an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So k < (-25)/(-4) \u2192 which is 25/4.\n\n25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k has to be less than 6.25. But the question asks for the largest integral value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 6 as an option. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Wait, none of them are 6. Did I do something wrong?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the discriminant. Let me double-check. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. Discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac, which is (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) \u2192 25 -4k. That's correct.\n\nSo 25 -4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <25/4 \u2192 k<6.25. So the maximum integer less than 6.25 is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps I've made a mistake, or maybe the options are wrong. Alternatively, maybe I misread the question.\n\nWait, the question is about the largest integral value. Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Let me compute 25 -4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k < 25/4 which is 6.25. So the maximum integer k can be is 6. But looking at the options, none is 6. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe I should write the discriminant again. Oh wait, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. Discriminant D= b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25 -4k. Correct.\n\nSo D must be positive: 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k < 6.25. So maximum integer is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps the question has a typo, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking for the largest k where the equation has two real roots. Let me check the options again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, but 6 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, 25 -4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <25/4 \u2192 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. So the options don't have 6. So maybe the question was written differently, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k =0. No, the question says x\u00b2 -5x +k =0.\n\nHmm, maybe I've made a mistake in the sign. Let me think: if the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, then the discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) =25 -4k. So for real and distinct roots, 25 -4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192k <6.25. So 6 is the maximum integer. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps the question is different, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the equation. Let me check again. The question says x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Oh wait, perhaps I should double-check the question.\n\nWait, the question is correct as written. So I must have made a mistake. Or perhaps I'm looking for the largest integer where the equation has two real roots, but maybe the options have a typo.\n\nWait, let's see the options again: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the discriminant.\n\nWait, discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac.\n\nHere, a=1, b=-5, c=k.\n\nSo D= (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25 -4k.\n\nSo 25 -4k must be greater than 0.\n\nSo 25>4k \u2192 4k<25 \u2192k <25/4 \u21926.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer less than 6.25 is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps the question is wrong, or perhaps I'm missing a trick here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 +5x +k =0. Let me see what happens then. Then a=1, b=5, c=k. D=25 -4k. So same as before. So same result. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k =0. Then c is -k. So D=25 -4*1*(-k) =25 +4k. So 25 +4k >0 \u21924k >-25 \u2192k> -6.25. So for that case, any k greater than -6.25 would work. But the question is about the largest integer, which would be unbounded above. But that's not the case here.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant formula. Let me make sure. The discriminant is indeed b\u00b2 -4ac. So for ax\u00b2 +bx +c, it's correct.\n\nWait, maybe the question is looking for the largest k where the equation has two real roots, but maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and perhaps the options are correct, but I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, 25 -4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192k <6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But the options don't have 6. So perhaps the options are wrong, or perhaps I misread the equation.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k =0. Then b=5, so D=25 -4k. Same as before. So same result. So same issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k =0. Then D=25 +4k. So 25 +4k>0 \u21924k> -25 \u2192k> -6.25. So any k greater than -6.25 is acceptable. But that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the smallest integral value, but no, the question says largest.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the question. Let me reread the question.\n\nThe question: What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 will have two real and distinct roots?\n\nOptions: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me compute 25 -4k >0 \u2192k <6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But the options don't include 6. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 +5x +k =0. Let's see. Then D=25 -4k. So same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and I'm to find the largest integer k where D is positive. So k must be less than 6.25. So 6 is the answer, but it's not in the options. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps I should consider the case where the equation has real roots, but perhaps the question is about the equation having real roots, not necessarily distinct. No, the question says two real and distinct roots, so discriminant must be positive.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the possible k values for each option and see which is the largest that satisfies D>0.\n\nLet me try each option:\n\nOption A)9: k=9.\n\nD=25 -4*9=25-36= -11. Negative. So no real roots. So invalid.\n\nOption B)7: D=25-28= -3. Also negative. No real roots.\n\nOption C)3: D=25-12=13>0. So yes, real roots.\n\nOption D)8: D=25-32= -7. Negative. No.\n\nOption E)12: D=25-48= -23. Negative.\n\nWait a minute! So among the options, only option C (k=3) gives a positive discriminant. So that would mean that the largest k in the options that works is 3. But wait, earlier I thought k could be up to 6.25. But according to this, all the options except C give D negative.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because when k=7, D is 25-28=-3<0, so no real roots. So the only option that gives a positive discriminant is C)3.\n\nSo the largest k in the options that works is 3. So the answer would be C)3.\n\nWait, but wait. How can that be? Because earlier I thought k could be up to 6.25, so 6 is the maximum. But 6 isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer is 3, but that seems odd because 3 is less than 6.25. But according to the options, 3 is the only one that works.\n\nWait, but why would the options not include 6? Maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the discriminant. Let me recalculate for k=6.25.\n\nWait, when k=6.25, D=25 -4*(6.25) =25-25=0. So D=0, which means a repeated root. So for k=6.25, the equation has one real root. So for two distinct real roots, k must be less than 6.25.\n\nSo for k=6, D=25-24=1>0. So yes, two real roots.\n\nBut since the options don't have 6, perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options. But the options given are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, but wait. Perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read the question again.\n\nOh wait, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So perhaps I should check for each option whether D is positive.\n\nLet me list the options:\n\nA) k=9 \u2192 D=25 -4*9=25-36=-11 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nB) k=7 \u2192 D=25-28=-3 <0 \u2192 no.\n\nC) k=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13>0 \u2192 yes.\n\nD)k=8 \u2192 D=25-32=-7 <0 \u2192 no.\n\nE)k=12 \u2192 D=25-48=-23 <0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo only option C gives a positive D. Therefore, the largest k among the options that gives two real and distinct roots is 3.\n\nSo the answer is C)3.\n\nWait, but this is conflicting with my earlier conclusion that k can be up to 6.25. So perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I misread the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and the only option that works is C)3.\n\nBut why would the options not include 6? I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation was x\u00b2 +5x +k =0. Then D=25-4k.\n\nWait, if k=7, D=25-28=-3 <0 \u2192 no.\n\nk=8: D=25-32=-7 <0.\n\nk=6: D=25-24=1>0.\n\nBut in this case, the options don't have 6 either. So I think the only correct option is C)3.\n",

So that would mean that the largest k in the options that works is 3. But wait, earlier I thought k could be up to 6.25. But according to this, all the options except C give D negative.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because when k=7, D is 25-28=-3<0, so no real roots. So the only option that gives a positive discriminant is C)3.\n\nSo the largest k in the options that works is 3. So the answer would be C)3.\n\nWait, but wait. How can that be? Because earlier I thought k could be up to 6.25, so 6 is the maximum. But 6 isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer is 3, but that seems odd because 3 is less than 6.25. But according to the options, 3 is the only one that works.\n\nWait, but why would the options not include 6? Maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the discriminant. Let me recalculate for k=6.25.\n\nWait, when k=6.25, D=25 -4*(6.25) =25-25=0. So D=0, which means a repeated root. So for k=6.25, the equation has one real root. So for two distinct real roots, k must be less than 6.25.\n\nSo for k=6, D=25-24=1>0. So yes, two real roots.\n\nBut since the options don't have 6, perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options. But the options given are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nWait, but wait. Perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read the question again.\n\nOh wait, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So perhaps I should check for each option whether D is positive.\n\nLet me list the options:\n\nA) k=9 \u2192 D=25 -4*9=25-36=-11 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nB) k=7 \u2192 D=25-28=-3 <0 \u2192 no.\n\nC) k=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13>0 \u2192 yes.\n\nD)k=8 \u2192 D=25-32=-7 <0 \u2192 no.\n\nE)k=12 \u2192 D=25-48=-23 <0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo only option C gives a positive D. Therefore, the largest k among the options that gives two real and distinct roots is 3.\n\nSo the answer is C)3.\n\nWait, but this is conflicting with my earlier conclusion that k can be up to 6.25. So perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I misread the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and the only option that works is C)3.\n\nBut why would the options not include 6? I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation was x\u00b2 +5x +k =0. Then D=25-4k.\n\nWait, if k=7, D=25-28=-3 <0 \u2192 no.\n\nk=8: D=25-32=-7 <0.\n\nk=6: D=25-24=1>0.\n\nBut in this case, the options don't have 6 either. So I think the only correct option is C)3.\n\n\nTo determine the largest integral value of \\( k \\) for which the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\) has two real and distinct roots, we analyze the discriminant of the quadratic equation. For a general quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant is given by:\n\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\nThe equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\) has \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -5 \\), and \\( c = k \\). Substituting these values into the discriminant formula:\n\n\\[\nD = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k\n\\]\n\nFor the quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive:\n\n\\[\n25 - 4k > 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\n25 > 4k \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k < \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( k \\) must be less than \\( 6.25 \\). The largest integer less than \\( 6.25 \\) is \\( 6 \\). However, \\( 6 \\) is not among the provided options. To verify, we check the discriminant for each option to determine if it satisfies \\( D > 0 \\):\n\n1. **Option A (\\( k = 9 \\))**:  \n   \\[\n   D = 25 - 4(9) = 25 - 36 = -11 \\quad (\\text{Negative, no real roots})\n   \\]\n\n2. **Option B (\\( k = 7 \\))**:  \n   \\[\n   D = 25 - 4(7) = 25 - 28 = -3 \\quad (\\text{Negative, no real roots})\n   \\]\n\n3. **Option C (\\( k = 3 \\))**:  \n   \\[\n   D = 25 - 4(3) = 25 - 12 = 13 \\quad (\\text{Positive, two real and distinct roots})\n   \\]\n\n4. **Option D (\\( k = 8 \\))**:  \n   \\[\n   D = 25 - 4(8) = 25 - 32 = -7 \\quad (\\text{Negative, no real roots})\n   \\]\n\n5. **Option E (\\( k = 12 \\))**:  \n   \\[\n   D = 25 - 4(12) = 25 - 48 = -23 \\quad (\\text{Negative, no real roots})\n   \\]\n\nAmong the options, only \\( k = 3 \\) satisfies \\( D > 0 \\), meaning the quadratic equation has two real and distinct roots. Therefore, the largest integral value of \\( k \\) from the given options is:\n\n**Answer: C**",
