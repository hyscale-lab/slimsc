      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a two-digit number. Hmm, let me try to understand what it's asking. The number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. Oh wait, that means if the number is, say, AB (where A is the tens digit and B is the units digit), then the number itself is 10A + B. The sum of the digits is A + B. So the equation would be 10A + B = (A + B) + 18. Oh right, because the number is 18 more than the sum of its digits.\n\nAnd there's another condition: the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. So that means B = 2A. Okay, that's the second equation.\n\nLet me write down these equations. \n\nFirst equation: 10A + B = (A + B) + 18.\n\nWait, simplifying that, subtract (A + B) from both sides. So 10A + B - A - B = 18. That leaves 9A = 18. So A = 18 / 9 = 2. Oh, so A is 2. \n\nThen, using the second condition, B = 2A. So if A is 2, B is 4. So the number would be 24. Let me check the options: option B is 24. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. If the number is 24, the sum of the digits is 2 + 4 = 6. The number itself is 24. 24 - 6 = 18. Oh yeah, that matches the first condition. So yeah, 24 should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but what about the other options? Let me quickly check them to see if any fit. For example, option C is 42. Let's see: 4 + 2 = 6, 42 -6=36, which isn't 18. So no. Option D is 48: 4+8=12, 48-12=36 again. Not 18. Option E is 49: 4+9=13, 49-13=36. Hmm, same. Option A is 12: 1+2=3, 12-3=9. Not 18. So yeah, only option B fits both conditions.\n",
