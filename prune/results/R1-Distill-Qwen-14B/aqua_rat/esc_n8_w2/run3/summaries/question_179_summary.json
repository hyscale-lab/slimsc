      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the cost of gardening around a rectangular plot. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe question says: What will be the cost of gardening a 1-metre broad boundary around a rectangular plot that has a perimeter of 340 metres. The rate is 10 per square metre. The options are A to E.\n\nHmm, first, I need to visualize this. The plot is rectangular, and we're adding a 1m wide boundary around it. So, the boundary itself is like a frame around the rectangle, right? The cost depends on the area of this boundary.\n\nWait, but how do I calculate the area of the boundary? I think it's the area of the larger rectangle (including the boundary) minus the area of the original plot. Because the boundary is the extra part around it.\n\nLet me think about the perimeters. The original plot has a perimeter of 340 meters. For a rectangle, the perimeter P is 2*(length + width). So, 2*(l + w) = 340. That simplifies to l + w = 170. But I don't know the individual lengths of l and w. Hmm, that's a problem because I need more information to find the area.\n\nWait, but maybe I don't need to know l and w separately. Because when I add a 1m boundary all around, the new dimensions become (l+2) and (w+2). Because adding 1m on each side increases both length and width by 2m each. So the new perimeter would be 2*( (l+2) + (w+2) ) = 2*(l + w +4) = 2*(170 +4) = 2*174 = 348 m. But wait, I don't think that's directly helpful because I need the area of the boundary.\n\nThe area of the original plot is l * w. The area after adding the boundary is (l+2) * (w+2). So the area of the boundary alone is (l+2)(w+2) - l*w. Let me expand that:\n\n(l+2)(w+2) = l*w + 2l + 2w +4. Subtracting l*w gives 2l + 2w +4. So the area of the boundary is 2(l + w) +4.\n\nWait, but from the perimeter, I know that l + w = 170. So substituting that in, the area becomes 2*(170) +4 = 340 +4 = 344 square meters. Oh, that's interesting. So the area is 344 m\u00b2.\n\nThe rate is 10 per square metre, so the cost is 344 *10 = 3440. Looking at the options, option C is 3440. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait a second, but wait, I might have made a mistake. Because sometimes when adding a boundary, especially a uniform width, you might have to think about whether it's a path or just the outer area. But in this case, I think the calculation is correct. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternative approach: The area of the boundary can be thought of as the perimeter of the original plot multiplied by the width of the boundary (1m), plus the area of the four corners. Wait, because when you add a 1m strip around, the area is perimeter * width + 4*(width^2). But wait, that's for a uniform width. Hmm, maybe that's another way to compute it.\n\nSo perimeter is 340 m. Width is 1m. So 340 *1 =340. Then 4*(1^2) =4. So total area is 340+4=344. Yep, same result. So that's correct.\n\nSo the cost is 344 *10 =3440. So the correct option is C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo calculate the cost of gardening a 1-metre broad boundary around a rectangular plot with a perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre, we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Determine the dimensions of the original plot**:  \n   The perimeter of a rectangle is given by \\( P = 2(l + w) \\), where \\( l \\) is the length and \\( w \\) is the width.

Hmm, the question says it's a 1-metre broad boundary around the plot, and the perimeter is 340 metres. The rate is 10 per square metre. I need to find the cost.\n\nWait, wait. So, the boundary is like a strip around the rectangle. Since it's 1 metre wide, I think that means the area we're calculating is that 1 metre strip. Oh, right, because when you have a boundary around a shape, the area of the boundary is the area of the larger shape minus the area of the original shape.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about the area of the boundary. So, I need to find the area of this 1-metre wide strip around the rectangle. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the boundary is a frame around the original rectangle, 1 metre wide. So, the area would be the perimeter multiplied by the width, but wait, is that always true?\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's think. For a rectangle, if you add a 1 metre wide strip around it, the new area would be (length + 2) * (width + 2). Because the length increases by 2 (1 on each side) and the width also increases by 2. So the area of the boundary would be (l+2)(w+2) - l*w. Let's compute that.\n\nExpanding (l+2)(w+2) gives l*w + 2l + 2w +4. Subtracting the original area l*w leaves 2l + 2w +4. Which is 2(l + w) +4. Wait, but the perimeter of a rectangle is 2(l + w). So perimeter is P = 2(l +w). So the area of the boundary is P + 4.\n\nWait, wait, because 2(l +w) is the perimeter, so substituting, the area becomes perimeter +4. But wait, the perimeter is given as 340, so area would be 340 +4=344. Then, multiply by the rate of 10 per square meter.\n\nSo 344 *10 =3440. So the cost would be 3440. Let me check the options. Option C is 3440, so that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Is the area of the boundary just the perimeter multiplied by the width, plus the corners? Because sometimes when you have a border, the area is perimeter * width + (4 * width^2), because each corner adds an extra square. But wait, in this case, the width is 1m, so the corners would add 4*(1)^2=4 m\u00b2. So the area of the boundary would be perimeter * width + 4*(width^2). Substituting, 340 *1 +4*(1)=344. So yes, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, when the width is 1m, the formula simplifies to perimeter +4, as we saw earlier. So the calculation is correct.\n\nSo the cost is 344 *10=3440. Looking back at the options, C is 3440. So the answer should be C.\n",
