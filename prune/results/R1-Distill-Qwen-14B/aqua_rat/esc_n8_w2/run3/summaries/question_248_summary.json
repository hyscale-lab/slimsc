      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about John making 3-letter codes. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nSo, the problem says there are 5 vowels and 20 consonants. The code is 3 letters long. The conditions are: the middle letter must be a vowel, and the first and third letters must both be consonants and different from each other. Hmm.\n\nLet me visualize the code structure. It's three letters, let's denote them as positions 1, 2, and 3. So, position 1 is the first letter, position 2 is the middle, and position 3 is the last.\n\nCondition 1: Middle letter (position 2) must be a vowel. Since there are 5 vowels, there are 5 choices for this position.\n\nCondition 2: First and third letters must be consonants, and they must be different from each other. So both positions 1 and 3 are consonants, but not the same.\n\nSo, the structure is C (consonant), V (vowel), C. But the two Cs can't be the same.\n\nLet me think about how to calculate the number of possible codes.\n\nFirst, for the middle letter: 5 options.\n\nNow, for the first letter: since it's a consonant, and there are 20 consonants, so 20 options.\n\nBut for the third letter, it's a consonant, but it can't be the same as the first. So after choosing the first consonant, the third has 19 options left.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that the first and third are different, so the order matters here. So the total number of possible combinations for the first and third letters is 20 (for first) multiplied by 19 (for third).\n\nSo putting it all together: the total number of codes is (number of options for first) * (number for middle) * (number for third).\n\nWhich would be 20 * 5 * 19.\n\nLet me calculate that. 20 times 5 is 100, multiplied by 19. Hmm, 100 times 19 is 1900. Wait, but let me check: 20*5=100, 100*19=1900.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 1900. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait another thought: the first letter is a consonant, 20 options. The third letter is a consonant different from the first. So the third letter has 19 options. Middle is 5. So 20 *5 *19 = 1900.\n\nSo the answer would be E) 1,900.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option E is 1,900. So that's the calculation.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: Are the consonants all distinct? The problem says different 5 vowels and 20 consonants, but I think it's implying that the consonants are all distinct letters, so each consonant is unique. So when choosing the first and third letters, they can't be the same.\n\nSo my calculation should be correct. So the total is 20*5*19 = 1900.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 1,900. So the answer is E.\n",

Let me visualize it as positions: first, second, third. The second has to be a vowel, and the first and third have to be consonants that are different from each other. Oh, and the first and third letters can't be the same. Right.\n\nSo, let's think step by step. First, the middle letter is a vowel. There are 5 vowels available, so for the second position, there are 5 choices.\n\nNow, the first and third letters are both consonants, and they must be different. So, how many consonants are there? 20. So for the first letter, I can choose any of the 20 consonants. Once I've chosen the first letter, the third letter has to be a different consonant. So that would be 19 choices left for the third position.\n\nWait, no, wait a minute. Are the consonants allowed to be repeated except for the first and third letters? The problem says the first and third letters must be different. So, for the third letter, it's 20 consonants minus 1 (the one used in the first position), so 19 options.\n\nSo putting it all together: the number of possible codes is the product of the number of choices for each position. That would be 20 (first letter) * 5 (second letter) * 19 (third letter).\n\nLet me calculate that: 20 *5 is 100, and 100 *19 is 1900. Oh wait, wait, wait. But wait, 20 *5 is 100, 100 *19 is 1900? No, wait, 100 * 19 is 1900. So the total number of codes is 1900.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The first letter has 20 options. The second has 5. Third has 19 (since it can't be the same as first). So 20 *5 *19 = 20*95=1900. Hmm.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 1900. So that's probably the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Are there any other constraints? No, the problem states that the first and third letters must be different and both consonants. The middle is a vowel. So yes, 20 *5 *19=1900. So the answer should be E) 1,900.\n\nWait, but wait another thought: sometimes in such problems, the letters are case-sensitive or if they can repeat elsewhere. But in this problem, the only constraints are that the first and third letters are different consonants, and the middle is a vowel. So no, I think the calculation is correct.\n",
