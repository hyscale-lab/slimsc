      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about population growth. Let me read it again carefully. The question is, if a city's population increases by 5% annually, what will the population be in two years if it's currently 78,000. The options are A through E, with E being none of these. \n\nHmm, I remember that percentage increases can be calculated using multiplication. So, each year, the population grows by 5%, which means each year it's multiplied by 1.05. Because 5% is the same as 0.05 in decimal, and adding that to 1 gives 1.05. So for one year, it's 78,000 * 1.05, and then the next year, we take that result and multiply by 1.05 again. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me think about how to compute this. Alternatively, I could calculate the increase each year step by step. Maybe that's clearer. Let's try that approach.\n\nFirst year: 5% of 78,000. To find 5%, I can calculate 78,000 * 0.05. Let me do that. 78,000 times 0.05 is 3,900. So after the first year, the population is 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900. That's the population at the end of year one.\n\nNow, the second year. The population is now 81,900, and it's increasing by 5% again. So I calculate 5% of 81,900. Let's compute that. 81,900 * 0.05. Hmm, 80,000 * 0.05 is 4,000, and 1,900 * 0.05 is 95. So 4,000 +95=4,095. So the increase is 4,095. Adding that to 81,900 gives 81,900 +4,095 = 85,995. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my math. Because sometimes when I do calculations quickly, I might make an error. Let me redo the second year's calculation. 81,900 * 0.05: 81,900 divided by 20, because 5% is 1/20. So 81,900 /20 is 4,095. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo after two years, the population would be 85,995. Looking at the options, option B is 85,995. So the answer should be B.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to calculate the total growth after two years in one step. The formula for compound growth is P = P0 * (1 + r)^t. Here, P0 is 78,000, r is 0.05, t is 2. So P = 78000 * (1.05)^2. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, 1.05 squared is 1.1025. Then multiply that by 78,000. 78,000 * 1.1025. Let's calculate that. 78,000 * 1.1 is 85,800. Then, 78,000 * 0.0025 is 195. So adding those together, 85,800 +195=85,995. Yep, same result as before. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again. Option C is 85,800. That's the result if I only took 10% for two years, but that's not how percentage increases work because each year's increase is based on the new population. So 5% each year leads to a higher increase in the second year than the first.\n\nSo the correct answer is B)85,995. Let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)81,900 (that's after one year)\n\nB)85,995\n\nC)85,800\n\nD)90,000\n\nE)None of these.\n\nSo since B is an option, the answer is B. So the correct choice is B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the population of the city after 2 years with an annual growth rate of 5%, we use the compound growth formula:\n\n\\[\nP = P_0 \\times (1 + r)^t\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\( P_0 = 78,000 \\) (initial population),\n- \\( r = 0.05 \\) (annual growth rate),\n- \\( t = 2 \\) (number of years).\n\nFirst, calculate \\( (1 + r)^t \\):\n\\[\n(1 + 0.05)^2 = 1.05^2 = 1.1025\n\\]\n\nNext, multiply this by the initial population:\n\\[\nP = 78,000 \\times 1.1025 = 85,995\n\\]\n\nThus, the population after 2 years is **85,995**.

They want to know what the population will be in two years. The options are A through E, with E being none of these.\n\nWait, population increasing by 5% annually. So that's a compound growth, right? Like each year, the population is multiplied by 1.05. Because 5% of the current population is added each year.\n\nSo, the formula for compound growth after n periods is P = P0*(1 + r)^n. Here, P0 is the initial population, r is the rate, and n is the number of periods.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. P0 is 78,000. Rate r is 5%, which is 0.05. And n is 2 years.\n\nSo, P = 78000 * (1.05)^2. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate (1.05)^2. 1.05 times 1.05. Let's see, 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.05 is 0.05. 0.05 times 1 is 0.05, and 0.05 times 0.05 is 0.0025. Adding them up: 1 + 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.0025 = 1.1025. Oh, right, because (a + b)^2 is a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. So 1.05 squared is 1.1025.\n\nSo, now multiply 78,000 by 1.1025. Let me do that calculation. 78,000 times 1.1025.\n\nHmm, maybe break it down. 78,000 * 1 is 78,000. 78,000 * 0.10 is 7,800. 78,000 * 0.0025 is, let's see, 78,000 * 0.002 is 156, and 78,000 * 0.0005 is 39. So 156 +39=195. So adding all parts together: 78,000 +7,800=85,800, plus 195 is 85,995.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check that. 78,000 * 0.1025. Oh wait, no, the multiplier is 1.1025, which is 1 + 0.1025. So 78,000 * 0.1025 is the increase over two years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it as 78,000 * 1.05 for the first year, then take that result and multiply by 1.05 again for the second year.\n\nLet me try that approach. First year: 78,000 * 1.05.\n\n78,000 * 1.05. So, 78,000 * 1 is 78,000. 78,000 * 0.05 is 3,900. So 78,000 +3,900=81,900. That's the population after one year.\n\nSecond year: 81,900 *1.05. Let's compute that. 81,900 *1 is 81,900. 81,900 *0.05 is 4,095. Adding those together: 81,900 +4,095=85,995.\n\nSo the population after two years is 85,995. Looking at the options, option B is 85,995. Option C is 85,800, which is lower. So B must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Because sometimes when I do math quickly, I might slip up.\n\nFirst year: 78,000 *5% is 3,900. So 78k +3.9k=81.9k. Correct.\n\nSecond year: 81,900 *5%. 81,900 *0.05 is 4,095. So 81,900 +4,095=85,995. Correct.\n\nSo option B is 85,995, which matches our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute it all in one go. 78,000 *1.1025.\n\n78,000 *1.1025. Let's compute 78,000 *1.1025.\n\nI can think of 1.1025 as 11025/10000. So 78,000 *11025 /10000.\n\nBut that might be more complicated.
