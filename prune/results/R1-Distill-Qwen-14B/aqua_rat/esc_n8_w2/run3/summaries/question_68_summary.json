      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about how many helpers are needed to prepare cakes. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nThe question says each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour. Oh right, and the kitchen is available for 3 hours. We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. So I need to find out how many helpers are required to meet these targets within the time frame.\n\nWait, each helper can choose to make either large or small cakes, right? So maybe some helpers will make large ones and others small. That makes sense because otherwise, if all helpers made only one type, we might not meet both requirements efficiently.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's say the number of helpers making large cakes is x, and those making small cakes is y. So the total helpers needed would be x + y.\n\nEach helper making large cakes can make 2 per hour. So in 3 hours, each makes 2 * 3 = 6 large cakes. So x helpers would make 6x large cakes. We need 20, so 6x \u2265 20. That simplifies to x \u2265 20/6, which is approximately 3.333. Since you can't have a fraction of a helper, x needs to be at least 4.\n\nSimilarly, for the small cakes: each helper makes 35 small cakes per hour. In 3 hours, that's 35 *3 = 105 per helper. So y helpers would make 105y small cakes. We need 700, so 105y \u2265700. Dividing both sides by 105, y \u2265700/105. Let me calculate that: 700 divided by 105. Hmm, 105 times 6 is 630, 105*7 is 735. So 700 is between 6 and 7. 700-630=70, 70/105 is 2/3. So 6 and 2/3, which is approximately 6.666. So y needs to be at least 7.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because x and y are the number of helpers, they have to be whole numbers. So x must be at least 4 and y at least 7. So the total helpers would be 4 +7=11. But looking at the options, 11 isn't an option. The choices are 8,10,12,15,19.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm not approaching this correctly. Because perhaps some helpers can switch between tasks, but wait, no, each helper can only make one type. Or maybe I should think about the maximum possible number of helpers to cover both, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me calculate how many helpers are needed for each type separately and then see the minimum total.\n\nFor large cakes: 20 needed. Each helper makes 6 in 3 hours. So 20 /6 = 3.333. So 4 helpers needed for large cakes.\n\nFor small cakes: 700 needed. Each helper makes 105 in 3 hours. 700/105 is about 6.666, so 7 helpers needed.\n\nTotal helpers would be 4 +7 =11. But the options don't have 11. So maybe I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe the helpers can work on both types in the same time? No, because the problem says each helper can make either 2 large or 35 small cakes per hour. So each helper is assigned to one task.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a system of equations. Let me try that.\n\nLet x = number of helpers making large cakes.\n\ny = number making small cakes.\n\nTotal helpers: x + y.\n\nWe have two constraints:\n\n6x \u226520 \u2192 x \u2265 20/6 \u22483.333 \u2192 x=4\n\n105y \u2265700 \u2192 y \u2265700/105 \u22486.666 \u2192 y=7\n\nSo x=4, y=7 \u2192 total 11. But no option 11.\n\nWait, perhaps the helpers can be split differently. Maybe not all helpers have to be assigned to only one type. Oh wait, no, the problem states each helper can make either 2 large or 35 small per hour. So each helper is assigned to one type.\n\nWait, maybe the time isn't 3 hours per helper, but 3 hours total. Oh wait, no, the kitchen is available for 3 hours. So each helper works for 3 hours. So my initial calculations are correct.\n\nSo if the options don't have 11, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, let me recheck. 4 helpers making large cakes: 4 * 6 =24 cakes. But we only need 20, so that's okay.\n\n7 helpers making small: 7 * 105 =735, which is more than 700. So that's okay.\n\nSo total helpers 11, but that's not an option. So perhaps the problem expects a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe some helpers can help with both, but that's not possible because each can only make one type.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should find a way to have the helpers contribute to both in a way that uses the same helpers for both, but that doesn't make sense because each helper is making either large or small.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the total number of helpers is such that the sum of their large and small cakes meets the required numbers.\n\nLet me think in terms of variables.\n\nLet x be the number of helpers making large cakes.\n\ny be the number making small.\n\nWe have:\n\n6x \u226520 \u2192 x \u2265 3.333 \u2192 x=4.\n\n105y \u2265700 \u2192 y\u22656.666\u2192 y=7.\n\nTotal helpers: 11. But no option. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a way that some helpers can make large and others small, but the total helpers would be less. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the same number of helpers for both, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the total number of helpers should be such that the time is the same for both, but that's already considered.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that each helper can make either 2 large or 35 small per hour, but perhaps they can switch between tasks. But no, the problem states each helper can make either, implying they choose one.\n\nWait, another angle: maybe the problem expects all helpers to make one type, but that would require more helpers. For example, if all helpers made large cakes, then each makes 6 per 3 hours. To make 20, you'd need 20/6 \u22483.333 \u2192 4 helpers. But then you wouldn't make any small cakes. So that's not possible. Similarly, if all made small, each makes 105 in 3h. 700/105=6.666\u21927 helpers. But then no large cakes. So the only way is to have some helpers for each.\n\nHmm. So 4+7=11, but no option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I set up the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the time is 3 hours, but the helpers can work in parallel. Oh, no, that's already accounted for.\n\nWait, maybe the helpers can make a combination of large and small, but each helper is only assigned to one type.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the minimal number of helpers such that the total cakes meet the requirement, regardless of the type. But that doesn't make sense because the problem specifies exactly 20 and 700.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set up equations where 6x + 6y =20 +700? No, that doesn't make sense because x and y are helpers for different types.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering the total number of helpers as a variable and then finding the minimal number that can cover both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each helper can make either 2 large OR 35 small, but perhaps I can model it as how many helpers are needed if some do large and others do small, such that both requirements are met.\n\nLet me try to find x and y such that 6x \u226520 and 105y\u2265700, and x + y is minimal.\n\nWait, but x must be at least 4, y at least 7. So 4+7=11. But that's not an option. So perhaps the question expects a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the cakes per helper. Let me recheck.\n\nEach helper can make 2 large per hour. So in 3 hours, 2*3=6.\n\nEach helper can make 35 small per hour, so 35*3=105.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of fractions. Like, perhaps some helpers can be assigned to both, but I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the problem as needing to meet both requirements with the minimal number of helpers. Let me see:\n\nTotal large cakes needed: 20. Each helper making large contributes 6. So 20/6 = 3.333 helpers. So 4 helpers.\n\nTotal small needed:700. 700/105=6.666, so 7 helpers.\n\nTotal helpers:11. But no option, so maybe the problem is expecting a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects that all helpers work on one type, but that can't be because then you can't meet both. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the maximum of the two required helpers. For example, 7 helpers for small, but 4 for large. So the total helpers would be the maximum, but that doesn't make sense because you need to cover both.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to find the minimal number of helpers that can make both 20 large and 700 small in 3 hours, possibly by some helpers working on both, but each helper can only do one type.\n\nWait, but each helper can only make one type, so you need x for large and y for small.\n\nSo the minimal total is 11, but that's not an option. So maybe the problem is intended to be solved by finding the maximum between the helpers needed for each, but that would give 7 helpers. But 7 helpers can't make 20 large in 3 hours. Because 7 helpers making large would make 7*6=42, which is more than 20. But 7 helpers making small would make 7*105=735, which is enough. But if you have 7 helpers all making small, you can't make any large. So that's not an option.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the maximum number between the two, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by looking at the rates in a different way. Let me think about the rates per hour.\n\nEach helper can make 2 large per hour or 35 small per hour.\n\nWe need to make 20 large and 700 small in 3 hours.\n\nSo let's model it in terms of per hour.\n\nLet x helpers make large, y helpers make small.\n\nIn each hour:\n\nLarge cakes made: 2x.\n\nSmall cakes made:35y.\n\nWe need to accumulate over 3 hours:\n\nTotal large: 3*(2x) \u226520 \u21926x\u226520 \u2192x\u22653.333 \u2192x=4.\n\nTotal small:3*(35y) \u2265700 \u2192105y\u2265700 \u2192y\u22656.666\u2192y=7.\n\nSo again, x=4, y=7, total helpers=11.\n\nBut again, the options don't have 11.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have all helpers make small cakes. Let me see: 700 small cakes.\n\nEach helper makes 35 per hour. So in 3 hours, 105 per helper.\n\n700 /105=6.666 \u21927 helpers. So 7 helpers can make 7*105=735 small cakes, which is more than enough. But then, the large cakes would require 20. If these 7 helpers only make small, they can't make any large. So we would need additional helpers for the large cakes.\n\nWait, but if 7 helpers are making small, how many more helpers are needed for large?\n\nEach helper for large makes 6 per 3 hours. So 20 /6=3.333 \u21924 helpers.\n\nSo total helpers would be 7+4=11. Again, not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck because my calculation leads to 11, but the options don't have it. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects that each helper can choose to make either large or small, but can switch during the 3 hours. But that would complicate the model, and the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants the minimal number of helpers that can produce at least 20 large and 700 small in 3 hours, regardless of how they're divided.\n\nWait, let me think of it as a system where helpers can be split between tasks. Let me let h be the total number of helpers.\n\nLet a be the number of helpers assigned to large cakes, and (h -a) to small.\n\nThen:\n\n6a \u226520 \u2192 a \u226520/6\u22483.333 \u2192a=4.\n\n105*(h -a) \u2265700 \u2192 (h -a) \u2265700/105 \u22486.666\u2192h -a\u22657.\n\nSo substituting a=4 into h -a \u22657 \u2192h\u226511.\n\nSo the minimal h is 11. But no option. So perhaps the problem is intended to have a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the maximum number of helpers, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem expects that helpers can't switch, and we need to find the minimal number of helpers that can handle both tasks in parallel, but that's not possible because each helper is assigned to one task.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to model it as a ratio. Let me see:\n\nWe have to make 20 large and 700 small.\n\nThe ratio of large to small is 20:700 \u2192 2:70 \u2192 1:35.\n\nEach helper making large produces 2 per hour, and each making small 35 per hour. So the ratio of their production rates is 2:35, which is the same as the required ratio. Interesting.\n\nSo perhaps this suggests that the number of helpers making large and small should be in the same ratio as 2:35.\n\nWait, let me think. Let me let the number of helpers making large be x, and small be y.\n\nWe want the ratio x/y = 2/35. Because the production rates are 2 per helper for large and 35 per helper for small. So to meet the required ratio of 20:700=1:35, the ratio of helpers should be 2:35.\n\nSo x/y =2/35 \u2192 x= (2/35)y.\n\nNow, the total large made is 6x =6*(2y/35) =12y/35.\n\nWe need 6x \u226520 \u219212y/35 \u226520 \u219212y\u2265700 \u2192 y\u2265700/12\u224858.333. But that can't be right because that would require a lot of helpers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try again.\n\nThe required ratio is large:small =20:700 =1:35.\n\nThe production per helper is 2:35.\n\nSo to maintain the ratio, the number of helpers making large and small should be in the same ratio as the production per helper.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of helpers should be in the inverse ratio of the cakes produced per helper.\n\nWait, production per helper for large is 2 per hour, small is 35 per hour.\n\nSo to produce the required ratio of 1:35, the number of helpers should be in the ratio of 35:2. Because for each helper making large, you need more helpers making small.\n\nWait, let me think. For every 1 helper making large (producing 2 per hour), you need 35/2 helpers making small to produce 35 per hour. Because 35/2 =17.5 helpers for small per helper for large.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio of helpers is (large helpers):(small helpers) = 35:2.\n\nSo, if x is large helpers, y is small helpers, then x/y =35/2 \u2192x= (35/2)y.\n\nBut we also have constraints:\n\n6x \u226520 \u2192x\u22653.333.\n\n105y \u2265700 \u2192y\u22656.666.\n\nSubstituting x= (35/2)y into the first equation:\n\n(35/2)y \u22653.333 \u2192 y\u2265 (3.333 *2)/35 \u22486.666/35\u22480.1905. But since y must be \u22656.666, this is automatically satisfied.\n\nSo the minimal y is 7. Then x= (35/2)*7= (35*7)/2=245/2=122.5. But that's impossible because x must be integer.\n\nThis approach isn't working. I'm probably overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me try another angle. Maybe the problem expects that each helper can only work on one type, and the minimal number of helpers is the maximum between the two required numbers. But that doesn't make sense because the two tasks are independent.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting that we find the number of helpers such that all the large and small cakes are made in the same 3 hours, and the helpers can be assigned to either, but the minimal number is the maximum of the two helpers needed.\n\nWait, no, because each task requires a certain number of helpers, and they're separate. So you can't have fewer than 4 helpers for large and 7 for small.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting that the helpers can be split in a way that the total number is the same for both, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering the time each type takes and then seeing the maximum time required, but that doesn't directly translate to the number of helpers.\n\nWait, let me think about the time required if only large cakes are made. 4 helpers making large, time is 3 hours, which is fine.\n\nIf only small cakes are made, 7 helpers making small, time is 3 hours, which is also fine.\n\nSo the total helpers would be 11. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting that the same helper can't make both, but perhaps I should model it as the sum of helpers required for each task, but that's what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the same helper can contribute to both, but I don't think that's possible.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the options again. The options are A)8, B)10, C)12, D)15, E)19.\n\nHmm. Let me try to see if any of these options can satisfy both conditions.\n\nOption B is 10 helpers. Let's see if 10 helpers can make 20 large and 700 small in 3 hours.\n\nLet me say x helpers make large, y make small. x + y =10.\n\nWe have:\n\n6x \u226520 \u2192x\u22653.333 \u2192x=4.\n\n105y \u2265700 \u2192y\u22656.666 \u2192y=7.\n\nBut 4+7=11>10. So 10 helpers can't do it because 4+7=11>10. So option B (10) is insufficient.\n\nOption C is 12 helpers.\n\nSo x=4, y=7. 4+7=11 \u226412. So yes, 12 helpers can cover both. Because with 12 helpers, we can assign 4 to large and 8 to small. Wait, but 8 would make 8*105=840 small, which is more than needed. But that's okay.\n\nWait, but why not 4 and 7? Because 4+7=11, which is less than 12. So 12 would be sufficient.\n\nSo the minimal number of helpers is 11, but since that's not an option, the next higher option is 12 (option C).\n\nWait, but why is 12 the answer? Because 11 isn't an option, but 12 is.\n\nSo the correct answer would be 12 helpers.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the number of helpers required to prepare 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in 3 hours, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Helper Productivity**:  \n   - Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour.  \n   - Over 3 hours, a helper making large cakes produces \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) large cakes.  \n   - Over 3 hours, a helper making small cakes produces \\( 35 \\times 3 = 105 \\) small cakes.\n\n2. **Requirements**:  \n   - For large cakes: \\( 20 \\) large cakes are needed.  \n     - Each helper making large cakes contributes 6 large cakes.  \n     - Minimum helpers for large cakes: \\( \\lceil \\frac{20}{6} \\rceil = 4 \\).  \n   - For small cakes: \\( 700 \\) small cakes are needed.  \n     - Each helper making small cakes contributes 105 small cakes.  \n     - Minimum helpers for small cakes: \\( \\lceil \\frac{700}{105} \\rceil = 7 \\).\n\n3. **Total Helpers**:  \n   - To meet both requirements, the total number of helpers is the sum of helpers assigned to large and small cakes:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total helpers} = 4 + 7 = 11.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Options Analysis**:  \n   - The calculated minimum number of helpers is 11, but this is not one of the provided options.  \n   - The next higher option is 12 helpers.  \n   - With 12 helpers, we can assign 4 helpers to large cakes and 8 helpers to small cakes.  \n     - 4 helpers making large cakes produce \\( 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\) large cakes (more than enough).  \n     - 8 helpers making small cakes produce \\( 8 \\times 105 = 840 \\) small cakes (more than enough).  \n   - Thus, 12 helpers are sufficient to meet the requirements.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of helpers required, based on the given options, is **12**.\n\nAnswer: C",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about how many helpers are needed to prepare cakes. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nThe question says each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour. Oh right, and the kitchen is available for 3 hours. We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. So I need to find out how many helpers are required to meet these targets within the time frame.\n\nWait, each helper can choose to make either large or small cakes, right? So maybe some helpers will make large ones and others small. That makes sense because otherwise, if all helpers made only one type, we might not meet both requirements efficiently.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's say the number of helpers making large cakes is x, and those making small cakes is y. So the total helpers needed would be x + y.\n\nEach helper making large cakes can make 2 per hour. So in 3 hours, each makes 2 * 3 = 6 large cakes. So x helpers would make 6x large cakes. We need 20, so 6x \u2265 20. That simplifies to x \u2265 20/6, which is approximately 3.333. Since you can't have a fraction of a helper, x needs to be at least 4.\n\nSimilarly, for the small cakes: each helper makes 35 small cakes per hour. In 3 hours, that's 35 *3 = 105 per helper. So y helpers would make 105y small cakes. We need 700, so 105y \u2265700. Dividing both sides by 105, y \u2265700/105. Let me calculate that: 700 divided by 105. Hmm, 105 times 6 is 630, 105*7 is 735. So 700 is between 6 and 7. 700-630=70, 70/105 is 2/3. So 6 and 2/3, which is approximately 6.666. So y needs to be at least 7.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because x and y are the number of helpers, they have to be whole numbers. So x must be at least 4 and y at least 7. So the total helpers would be 4 +7=11. But looking at the options, 11 isn't an option. The choices are 8,10,12,15,19.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm not approaching this correctly. Because perhaps some helpers can switch between tasks, but wait, no, each helper can only make one type. Or maybe I should think about the maximum possible number of helpers to cover both, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me calculate how many helpers are needed for each type separately and then see the minimum total.\n\nFor large cakes: 20 needed. Each helper makes 6 in 3 hours. So 20 /6 = 3.333. So 4 helpers needed for large cakes.\n\nFor small cakes: 700 needed. Each helper makes 105 in 3 hours. 700/105 is about 6.666, so 7 helpers needed.\n\nTotal helpers would be 4 +7 =11. But the options don't have 11. So maybe I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe the helpers can work on both types in the same time? No, because the problem says each helper can make either 2 large or 35 small cakes per hour. So each helper is assigned to one task.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a system of equations.

But no option 11.\n\nWait, perhaps the helpers can be split differently. Maybe not all helpers have to be assigned to only one type. Oh wait, no, the problem states each helper can make either 2 large or 35 small per hour. So each helper is assigned to one type.\n\nWait, maybe the time isn't 3 hours per helper, but 3 hours total. Oh wait, no, the kitchen is available for 3 hours. So each helper works for 3 hours. So my initial calculations are correct.\n\nSo if the options don't have 11, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, let me recheck. 4 helpers making large cakes: 4 * 6 =24 cakes. But we only need 20, so that's okay.\n\n7 helpers making small: 7 * 105 =735, which is more than 700. So that's okay.\n\nSo total helpers 11, but that's not an option. So perhaps the problem expects a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe some helpers can help with both, but that's not possible because each can only make one type.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should find a way to have the helpers contribute to both in a way that uses the same helpers for both, but that doesn't make sense because each helper is making either large or small.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the total number of helpers is such that the sum of their large and small cakes meets the required numbers.\n\nLet me think in terms of variables.\n\nLet x be the number of helpers making large cakes.\n\ny be the number making small.\n\nWe have:\n\n6x \u226520 \u2192 x \u2265 3.333 \u2192 x=4.\n\n105y \u2265700 \u2192 y\u22656.666\u2192 y=7.\n\nTotal helpers: 11. But no option. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a way that some helpers can make large and others small, but the total helpers would be less. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the same number of helpers for both, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the total number of helpers should be such that the time is the same for both, but that's already considered.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that each helper can make either 2 large or 35 small per hour, but perhaps they can switch between tasks. But no, the problem states each helper can make either, implying they choose one.\n\nWait, another angle: maybe the problem expects all helpers to make one type, but that would require more helpers. For example, if all helpers made large cakes, then each makes 6 per 3 hours. To make 20, you'd need 20/6 \u22483.333 \u2192 4 helpers. But then you wouldn't make any small cakes. So that's not possible. Similarly, if all made small, each makes 105 in 3h. 700/105=6.666\u21927 helpers. But then no large cakes. So the only way is to have some helpers for each.\n\nHmm. So 4+7=11, but no option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I set up the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the time is 3 hours, but the helpers can work in parallel. Oh, no, that's already accounted for.\n\nWait, maybe the helpers can make a combination of large and small, but each helper is only assigned to one type.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the minimal number of helpers such that the total cakes meet the requirement, regardless of the type. But that doesn't make sense because the problem specifies exactly 20 and 700.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set up equations where 6x + 6y =20 +700? No, that doesn't make sense because x and y are helpers for different types.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering the total number of helpers as a variable and then finding the minimal number that can cover both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each helper can make either 2 large OR 35 small, but perhaps I can model it as how many helpers are needed if some do large and others do small, such that both requirements are met.\n\nLet me try to find x and y such that 6x \u226520 and 105y\u2265700, and x + y is minimal.\n\nWait, but x must be at least 4, y at least 7. So 4+7=11. But that's not an option. So perhaps the question expects a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the cakes per helper. Let me recheck.\n\nEach helper can make 2 large per hour. So in 3 hours, 2*3=6.\n\nEach helper can make 35 small per hour, so 35*3=105.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of fractions. Like, perhaps some helpers can be assigned to both, but I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the problem as needing to meet both requirements with the minimal number of helpers. Let me see:\n\nTotal large cakes needed: 20. Each helper making large contributes 6. So 20/6 = 3.333 helpers. So 4 helpers.\n\nTotal small needed:700. 700/105=6.666, so 7 helpers.\n\nTotal helpers:11. But no option, so maybe the problem is expecting a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects that all helpers work on one type, but that can't be because then you can't meet both. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the maximum of the two required helpers. For example, 7 helpers for small, but 4 for large. So the total helpers would be the maximum, but that doesn't make sense because you need to cover both.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to find the minimal number of helpers that can make both 20 large and 700 small in 3 hours, possibly by some helpers working on both, but each helper can only do one type.\n\nWait, but each helper can only make one type, so you need x for large and y for small.\n\nSo the minimal total is 11, but that's not an option. So maybe the problem is intended to be solved by finding the maximum between the helpers needed for each, but that would give 7 helpers. But 7 helpers can't make 20 large in 3 hours. Because 7 helpers making large would make 7*6=42, which is more than 20. But 7 helpers making small would make 7*105=735, which is enough. But if you have 7 helpers all making small, you can't make any large. So that's not an option.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the maximum number between the two, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by looking at the rates in a different way. Let me think about the rates per hour.\n\nEach helper can make 2 large per hour or 35 small per hour.\n\nWe need to make 20 large and 700 small in 3 hours.\n\nSo let's model it in terms of per hour.\n\nLet x helpers make large, y helpers make small.\n\nIn each hour:\n\nLarge cakes made: 2x.\n\nSmall cakes made:35y.\n\nWe need to accumulate over 3 hours:\n\nTotal large: 3*(2x) \u226520 \u21926x\u226520 \u2192x\u22653.333 \u2192x=4.\n\nTotal small:3*(35y) \u2265700 \u2192105y\u2265700 \u2192y\u22656.666\u2192y=7.\n\nSo again, x=4, y=7, total helpers=11.\n\nBut again, the options don't have 11.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have all helpers make small cakes. Let me see: 700 small cakes.\n\nEach helper makes 35 per hour. So in 3 hours, 105 per helper.\n\n700 /105=6.666 \u21927 helpers. So 7 helpers can make 7*105=735 small cakes, which is more than enough. But then, the large cakes would require 20. If these 7 helpers only make small, they can't make any large. So we would need additional helpers for the large cakes.\n\nWait, but if 7 helpers are making small, how many more helpers are needed for large?\n\nEach helper for large makes 6 per 3 hours. So 20 /6=3.333 \u21924 helpers.\n\nSo total helpers would be 7+4=11. Again, not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck because my calculation leads to 11, but the options don't have it. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects that each helper can choose to make either large or small, but can switch during the 3 hours. But that would complicate the model, and the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants the minimal number of helpers that can produce at least 20 large and 700 small in 3 hours, regardless of how they're divided.\n\nWait, let me think of it as a system where helpers can be split between tasks. Let me let h be the total number of helpers.\n\nLet a be the number of helpers assigned to large cakes, and (h -a) to small.\n\nThen:\n\n6a \u226520 \u2192 a \u226520/6\u22483.333 \u2192a=4.\n\n105*(h -a) \u2265700 \u2192 (h -a) \u2265700/105 \u22486.666\u2192h -a\u22657.\n\nSo substituting a=4 into h -a \u22657 \u2192h\u226511.\n\nSo the minimal h is 11. But no option. So perhaps the problem is intended to have a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the maximum number of helpers, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem expects that helpers can't switch, and we need to find the minimal number of helpers that can handle both tasks in parallel, but that's not possible because each helper is assigned to one task.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to model it as a ratio. Let me see:\n\nWe have to make 20 large and 700 small.\n\nThe ratio of large to small is 20:700 \u2192 2:70 \u2192 1:35.\n\nEach helper making large produces 2 per hour, and each making small 35 per hour. So the ratio of their production rates is 2:35, which is the same as the required ratio. Interesting.\n\nSo perhaps this suggests that the number of helpers making large and small should be in the same ratio as 2:35.\n\nWait, let me think. Let me let the number of helpers making large be x, and small be y.\n\nWe want the ratio x/y = 2/35. Because the production rates are 2 per helper for large and 35 per helper for small. So to meet the required ratio of 20:700=1:35, the ratio of helpers should be 2:35.\n\nSo x/y =2/35 \u2192 x= (2/35)y.\n\nNow, the total large made is 6x =6*(2y/35) =12y/35.\n\nWe need 6x \u226520 \u219212y/35 \u226520 \u219212y\u2265700 \u2192 y\u2265700/12\u224858.333. But that can't be right because that would require a lot of helpers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try again.\n\nThe required ratio is large:small =20:700 =1:35.\n\nThe production per helper is 2:35.\n\nSo to maintain the ratio, the number of helpers making large and small should be in the same ratio as the production per helper.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of helpers should be in the inverse ratio of the cakes produced per helper.\n\nWait, production per helper for large is 2 per hour, small is 35 per hour.\n\nSo to produce the required ratio of 1:35, the number of helpers should be in the ratio of 35:2. Because for each helper making large, you need more helpers making small.\n\nWait, let me think. For every 1 helper making large (producing 2 per hour), you need 35/2 helpers making small to produce 35 per hour. Because 35/2 =17.5 helpers for small per helper for large.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio of helpers is (large helpers):(small helpers) = 35:2.\n\nSo, if x is large helpers, y is small helpers, then x/y =35/2 \u2192x= (35/2)y.\n\nBut we also have constraints:\n\n6x \u226520 \u2192x\u22653.333.\n\n105y \u2265700 \u2192y\u22656.666.\n\nSubstituting x= (35/2)y into the first equation:\n\n(35/2)y \u22653.333 \u2192 y\u2265 (3.333 *2)/35 \u22486.666/35\u22480.1905. But since y must be \u22656.666, this is automatically satisfied.\n\nSo the minimal y is 7. Then x= (35/2)*7= (35*7)/2=245/2=122.5. But that's impossible because x must be integer.\n\nThis approach isn't working. I'm probably overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me try another angle. Maybe the problem expects that each helper can only work on one type, and the minimal number of helpers is the maximum between the two required numbers. But that doesn't make sense because the two tasks are independent.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting that we find the number of helpers such that all the large and small cakes are made in the same 3 hours, and the helpers can be assigned to either, but the minimal number is the maximum of the two helpers needed.\n\nWait, no, because each task requires a certain number of helpers, and they're separate. So you can't have fewer than 4 helpers for large and 7 for small.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting that the helpers can be split in a way that the total number is the same for both, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering the time each type takes and then seeing the maximum time required, but that doesn't directly translate to the number of helpers.\n\nWait, let me think about the time required if only large cakes are made. 4 helpers making large, time is 3 hours, which is fine.\n\nIf only small cakes are made, 7 helpers making small, time is 3 hours, which is also fine.\n\nSo the total helpers would be 11. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting that the same helper can't make both, but perhaps I should model it as the sum of helpers required for each task, but that's what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the same helper can contribute to both, but I don't think that's possible.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the options again. The options are A)8, B)10, C)12, D)15, E)19.\n\nHmm. Let me try to see if any of these options can satisfy both conditions.\n\nOption B is 10 helpers. Let's see if 10 helpers can make 20 large and 700 small in 3 hours.\n\nLet me say x helpers make large, y make small. x + y =10.\n\nWe have:\n\n6x \u226520 \u2192x\u22653.333 \u2192x=4.\n\n105y \u2265700 \u2192y\u22656.666 \u2192y=7.\n\nBut 4+7=11>10. So 10 helpers can't do it because 4+7=11>10. So option B (10) is insufficient.\n\nOption C is 12 helpers.\n\nSo x=4, y=7. 4+7=11 \u226412. So yes, 12 helpers can cover both. Because with 12 helpers, we can assign 4 to large and 8 to small. Wait, but 8 would make 8*105=840 small, which is more than needed. But that's okay.\n\nWait, but why not 4 and 7? Because 4+7=11, which is less than 12. So 12 would be sufficient.\n\nSo the minimal number of helpers is 11, but since that's not an option, the next higher option is 12 (option C).\n\nWait, but why is 12 the answer? Because 11 isn't an option, but 12 is.\n\nSo the correct answer would be 12 helpers.\n\n\nTo determine the number of helpers required to prepare 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in 3 hours, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Helper Productivity**:  \n   - Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour.  \n   - Over 3 hours, a helper making large cakes produces \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) large cakes.  \n   - Over 3 hours, a helper making small cakes produces \\( 35 \\times 3 = 105 \\) small cakes.\n\n2. **Requirements**:  \n   - For large cakes: \\( 20 \\) large cakes are needed.  \n     - Each helper making large cakes contributes 6 large cakes.  \n     - Minimum helpers for large cakes: \\( \\lceil \\frac{20}{6} \\rceil = 4 \\).  \n   - For small cakes: \\( 700 \\) small cakes are needed.  \n     - Each helper making small cakes contributes 105 small cakes.  \n     - Minimum helpers for small cakes: \\( \\lceil \\frac{700}{105} \\rceil = 7 \\).\n\n3. **Total Helpers**:  \n   - To meet both requirements, the total number of helpers is the sum of helpers assigned to large and small cakes:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total helpers} = 4 + 7 = 11.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Options Analysis**:  \n   - The calculated minimum number of helpers is 11, but this is not one of the provided options.  \n   - The next higher option is 12 helpers.  \n   - With 12 helpers, we can assign 4 helpers to large cakes and 8 helpers to small cakes.  \n     - 4 helpers making large cakes produce \\( 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\) large cakes (more than enough).  \n     - 8 helpers making small cakes produce \\( 8 \\times 105 = 840 \\) small cakes (more than enough).  \n   - Thus, 12 helpers are sufficient to meet the requirements.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of helpers required, based on the given options, is **12**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about figuring out how many helpers are needed to prepare cakes. Hmm, let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.\n\nAlright, the problem says that each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour. The kitchen is available for 3 hours. They need to prepare 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. I need to find out how many helpers are required to meet this goal.\n\nWait, so each helper can choose to make either large or small cakes. That means some helpers might be making large ones and others small ones, right? So I guess I have to figure out how to distribute the helpers between the two tasks to meet the required number of cakes in the given time.\n\nLet me break this down. First, let's think about the time. The kitchen is available for 3 hours. So each helper can work for 3 hours.\n\nFor large cakes: Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour. So in 3 hours, one helper can make 2 * 3 = 6 large cakes.\n\nFor small cakes: Each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour. So in 3 hours, one helper can make 35 * 3 = 105 small cakes.\n\nBut wait, they need 20 large and 700 small. So maybe some helpers are assigned to make large cakes and others to small ones.\n\nLet me denote the number of helpers assigned to large cakes as L and those assigned to small cakes as S. So the total number of helpers needed is L + S.\n\nEach helper making large cakes contributes 6 cakes. So total large cakes made would be 6 * L. This needs to be at least 20. So 6L \u226520 \u2192 L \u226520/6 \u22483.333. Since L must be an integer, L \u22654.\n\nSimilarly, each helper making small cakes contributes 105 cakes. So total small cakes made would be 105 * S. This needs to be at least 700. So 105S \u2265700 \u2192 S \u2265700/105 \u22486.666. So S must be at least 7.\n\nSo if I take L=4 and S=7, that's 4+7=11 helpers. But wait, let me check if that's enough.\n\nFor large cakes: 4 helpers *6 =24 cakes, which is more than 20 needed. That's fine.\n\nFor small cakes:7 helpers *105=735, which is more than 700. Also fine.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have 11 as an option. The options are A)8, B)10, C)12, D)15, E)19.\n\nHmm, so perhaps there's a way to have fewer helpers if some helpers can split their time? Wait, no, because each helper can only make one type of cake. They can't switch; they have to choose one or the other each hour.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to have some helpers make some large and some small, but I don't think that's possible because each helper can only make either 2 large or 35 small per hour. So each helper must choose to do one or the other.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps some helpers can work on both types in the same time? No, that's not possible because each helper can only make one type per hour. So each helper is assigned entirely to one type.\n\nSo with L=4 and S=7, 11 helpers are needed, but that's not one of the options. So maybe I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each helper can make either type, but perhaps it's possible to have some helpers work only part of the time on each. But no, because the kitchen is available for 3 hours, so each helper can work the full 3 hours on their assigned task.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as an equation, considering the time each helper contributes to each type.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me think in terms of the maximum number of each type needed.\n\nTotal large cakes needed:20. Each helper can make 6 in 3 hours. So minimum L is ceil(20/6)=4.\n\nSimilarly, small cakes:700. Each helper can make 105. So S=ceil(700/105)=7. So total helpers is 11. But 11 isn't an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the helpers can't be split into L and S; maybe all helpers have to work on the same type, which is not efficient.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the problem says each helper can make either 2 large or 35 small. So they can choose, but perhaps we have to assign some to each.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Perhaps I can model this as a linear programming problem, but since it's a multiple-choice question, maybe there's a way to find the minimal number of helpers.\n\nWait, but since the options are given, perhaps I can test each option to see which is the minimal number that satisfies both conditions.\n\nLet me think: The total number of helpers is N. Some are assigned to large, others to small.\n\nLet me denote x as the number of helpers making large cakes, and (N - x) as those making small.\n\nThen,\n\n2 * 3 * x >= 20 \u2192 6x >=20 \u2192 x >= 20/6 \u22483.333 \u2192 x \u22654.\n\n35 *3*(N - x) >=700 \u2192 105(N -x) >=700 \u2192 N -x >= 700/105 \u22486.666 \u2192 N -x \u22657.\n\nSo adding these two inequalities:\n\nx \u22654,\n\nN -x \u22657 \u2192 N \u2265 x +7.\n\nSo the minimal N is when x is minimal, which is x=4. So N\u22654+7=11. But 11 isn't an option. The next possible option is 12.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 11, so perhaps 12 is the answer, which is option C.\n\nBut let me check: if N=12.\n\nWe can have x=4 and S=8.\n\nBecause 4 helpers making large: 4*6=24 \u226520.\n\n8 helpers making small:8*105=840 \u2265700.\n\nYes, that's sufficient. So 12 helpers would work.\n\nWait, but maybe with N=10, is it possible?\n\nLet me test N=10.\n\nWe need x \u22654 and (10 -x) \u22657.\n\nSo 10 -x \u22657 \u2192x \u22643.\n\nBut x must be \u22654. So x can't be both \u22643 and \u22654. So it's impossible. Thus N=10 is insufficient.\n\nSimilarly, for N=8:\n\n8 -x \u22657 \u2192x \u22641. But x needs to be \u22654. So no solution. So N=8 is too small.\n\nWhat about N=12:\n\nx=4, N -x=8 \u2192 4+8=12. That works.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x can be higher. Like x=5, N-x=7. So 5+7=12.\n\nEither way, 12 helpers can meet both requirements.\n\nSo the answer should be C)12.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about figuring out how many helpers are needed to prepare cakes. Hmm, let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.\n\nAlright, the problem says that each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour. The kitchen is available for 3 hours. They need to prepare 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. I need to find out how many helpers are required to meet this goal.\n\nWait, so each helper can choose to make either large or small cakes. That means some helpers might be making large ones and others small ones, right? So I guess I have to figure out how to distribute the helpers between the two tasks to meet the required number of cakes in the given time.\n\nLet me break this down. First, let's think about the time. The kitchen is available for 3 hours. So each helper can work for 3 hours.\n\nFor large cakes: Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour. So in 3 hours, one helper can make 2 * 3 = 6 large cakes.\n\nFor small cakes: Each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour. So in 3 hours, one helper can make 35 * 3 = 105 small cakes.\n\nBut wait, they need 20 large and 700 small. So maybe some helpers are assigned to make large cakes and others to small ones.\n\nLet me denote the number of helpers assigned to large cakes as L and those assigned to small cakes as S. So the total number of helpers needed is L + S.\n\nEach helper making large cakes contributes 6 cakes. So total large cakes made would be 6 * L. This needs to be at least 20. So 6L \u226520 \u2192 L \u226520/6 \u22483.333. Since L must be an integer, L \u22654.\n\nSimilarly, each helper making small cakes contributes 105 cakes. So total small cakes made would be 105 * S. This needs to be at least 700. So 105S \u2265700 \u2192 S \u2265700/105 \u22486.666. So S must be at least 7.\n\nSo if I take L=4 and S=7, that's 4+7=11 helpers. But wait, let me check if that's enough.\n\nFor large cakes: 4 helpers *6 =24 cakes, which is more than 20 needed. That's fine.\n\nFor small cakes:7 helpers *105=735, which is more than 700. Also fine.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have 11 as an option. The options are A)8, B)10, C)12, D)15, E)19.\n\nHmm, so perhaps there's a way to have fewer helpers if some helpers can split their time? Wait, no, because each helper can only make one type of cake. They can't switch; they have to choose one or the other each hour.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to have some helpers make some large and some small, but I don't think that's possible because each helper can only make either 2 large or 35 small per hour. So each helper must choose to do one or the other.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps some helpers can work on both types in the same time? No, that's not possible because each helper can only make one type per hour. So each helper is assigned entirely to one type.\n\nSo with L=4 and S=7, 11 helpers are needed, but that's not one of the options. So maybe I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each helper can make either type, but perhaps it's possible to have some helpers work only part of the time on each. But no, because the kitchen is available for 3 hours, so each helper can work the full 3 hours on their assigned task.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as an equation, considering the time each helper contributes to each type.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me think in terms of the maximum number of each type needed.\n\nTotal large cakes needed:20. Each helper can make 6 in 3 hours. So minimum L is ceil(20/6)=4.\n\nSimilarly, small cakes:700. Each helper can make 105. So S=ceil(700/105)=7. So total helpers is 11. But 11 isn't an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the helpers can't be split into L and S; maybe all helpers have to work on the same type, which is not efficient.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the problem says each helper can make either 2 large or 35 small. So they can choose, but perhaps we have to assign some to each.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Perhaps I can model this as a linear programming problem, but since it's a multiple-choice question, maybe there's a way to find the minimal number of helpers.\n\nWait, but since the options are given, perhaps I can test each option to see which is the minimal number that satisfies both conditions.\n\nLet me think: The total number of helpers is N. Some are assigned to large, others to small.\n\nLet me denote x as the number of helpers making large cakes, and (N - x) as those making small.\n\nThen,\n\n2 * 3 * x >= 20 \u2192 6x >=20 \u2192 x >= 20/6 \u22483.333 \u2192 x \u22654.\n\n35 *3*(N - x) >=700 \u2192 105(N -x) >=700 \u2192 N -x >= 700/105 \u22486.666 \u2192 N -x \u22657.\n\nSo adding these two inequalities:\n\nx \u22654,\n\nN -x \u22657 \u2192 N \u2265 x +7.\n\nSo the minimal N is when x is minimal, which is x=4. So N\u22654+7=11. But 11 isn't an option. The next possible option is 12.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 11, so perhaps 12 is the answer, which is option C.\n\nBut let me check: if N=12.\n\nWe can have x=4 and S=8.\n\nBecause 4 helpers making large: 4*6=24 \u226520.\n\n8 helpers making small:8*105=840 \u2265700.\n\nYes, that's sufficient. So 12 helpers would work.\n\nWait, but maybe with N=10, is it possible?\n\nLet me test N=10.\n\nWe need x \u22654 and (10 -x) \u22657.\n\nSo 10 -x \u22657 \u2192x \u22643.\n\nBut x must be \u22654. So x can't be both \u22643 and \u22654. So it's impossible. Thus N=10 is insufficient.\n\nSimilarly, for N=8:\n\n8 -x \u22657 \u2192x \u22641. But x needs to be \u22654. So no solution. So N=8 is too small.\n\nWhat about N=12:\n\nx=4, N -x=8 \u2192 4+8=12. That works.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x can be higher. Like x=5, N-x=7. So 5+7=12.\n\nEither way, 12 helpers can meet both requirements.\n\nSo the answer should be C)12.\n\n\nTo determine the number of helpers required, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Cake Production Rates**:  \n   - Each helper can make **2 large cakes/hour** or **35 small cakes/hour**.  \n   - Over 3 hours, one helper can make:  \n     - \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) large cakes.  \n     - \\( 35 \\times 3 = 105 \\) small cakes.\n\n2. **Total Cakes Needed**:  \n   - **Large cakes**: 20.  \n   - **Small cakes**: 700.  \n\n3. **Helper Allocation**:  \n   - Let \\( L \\) be the number of helpers assigned to large cakes. Each contributes 6 large cakes, so:  \n     \\[\n     6L \\geq 20 \\implies L \\geq \\frac{20}{6} \\approx 3.333 \\implies L \\geq 4.\n     \\]\n   - Let \\( S \\) be the number of helpers assigned to small cakes. Each contributes 105 small cakes, so:  \n     \\[\n     105S \\geq 700 \\implies S \\geq \\frac{700}{105} \\approx 6.666 \\implies S \\geq 7.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Total Helpers**:  \n   - The total number of helpers is \\( L + S \\).  \n   - Substituting the minimum values of \\( L = 4 \\) and \\( S = 7 \\):  \n     \\[\n     L + S = 4 + 7 = 11.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Checking the Options**:  \n   - The options provided are \\( 8, 10, 12, 15, 19 \\). Since \\( 11 \\) is not an option, we test the next possible value, \\( 12 \\).  \n   - For \\( N = 12 \\):  \n     - Assign \\( L = 4 \\) helpers to large cakes:  \n       \\[\n       4 \\times 6 = 24 \\geq 20.\n       \\]\n     - Assign \\( S = 8 \\) helpers to small cakes:  \n       \\[\n       8 \\times 105 = 840 \\geq 700.\n       \\]\n     - Both conditions are satisfied.  \n\n6. **Testing Smaller Values**:  \n   - For \\( N = 10 \\):  \n     - \\( L \\geq 4 \\) and \\( S \\geq 7 \\) imply \\( N = L + S \\geq 4 + 7 = 11 \\).  \n     - \\( N = 10 \\) is insufficient.  \n   - For \\( N = 8 \\):  \n     - Similarly, \\( N = 8 \\) is too small to satisfy the requirements.  \n\nThus, the minimum number of helpers required is \\( 12 \\), which satisfies both the large and small cake requirements.  \n\n**Answer: C**",
