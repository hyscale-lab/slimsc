      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a jeep traveling a certain distance. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that during the forward journey, the jeep takes 6 hours. Then, on the return trip, it increases its speed by 12 km/hr and takes 4 hours. I need to find the distance it traveled. \n\nWait, so the distance for the forward and return journeys should be the same, right? Because it's going somewhere and coming back. So the distance 'd' is the same in both cases.\n\nLet me think about the variables. Let's say the speed during the forward journey is 'v' km/hr. Then, the time taken is 6 hours. So using the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time, the distance d would be v * 6. \n\nOn the return trip, the speed is increased by 12 km/hr, so the new speed is v + 12. The time taken is 4 hours, so the distance for the return trip is (v + 12) * 4. \n\nBut since the distance is the same both ways, I can set these two expressions equal to each other. So, 6v = 4(v + 12). \n\nLet me write that down:\n\n6v = 4(v + 12)\n\nExpanding the right side: 6v = 4v + 48\n\nSubtract 4v from both sides: 2v = 48\n\nDivide both sides by 2: v = 24 km/hr.\n\nSo the speed during the forward journey was 24 km/hr. Now, I can find the distance by plugging back into either equation. Let's use the forward journey: d = 6 * 24 = 144 km.\n\nWait, but let me double-check using the return journey. The return speed is 24 + 12 = 36 km/hr. Time is 4 hours. So 36 *4 is 144. Yep, same result.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 144 km. So that must be the correct answer.\n",
