      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about mixing soft drinks. Hmm, let me read it again. It says that one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water. The question is asking how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink. The options are A to E, with E being 2 gallons. \n\nWait, I think I need to find out how much more orange juice to add so that the total orange juice becomes 60% of the new mixture. Let me think about this.\n\nSo initially, there's one gallon of soft drink. 40% of that is orange juice, so that's 0.4 gallons of OJ and 0.6 gallons of water. Now, I'm adding some orange juice to this. Let me call the amount of orange juice to add 'x' gallons. \n\nAfter adding x gallons of OJ, the total volume of the soft drink becomes 1 + x gallons because I'm only adding OJ, which is a liquid. The amount of OJ becomes 0.4 + x gallons. \n\nThe goal is for OJ to be 60% of the new mixture. So, 0.4 + x should equal 60% of (1 + x). Let me write that as an equation.\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 * (1 + x)\n\nLet me expand the right side. 0.6*(1) is 0.6, and 0.6*x is 0.6x. So the equation becomes:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nHmm, I need to solve for x. Let's subtract 0.6x from both sides to get the x terms on one side.\n\n0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\nNow, subtract 0.4 from both sides:\n\n0.4x = 0.6 - 0.4\n0.4x = 0.2\n\nSo x equals 0.2 divided by 0.4. That's 0.5. Wait, so x is 0.5 gallons. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf I add 0.5 gallons of OJ, the total OJ is 0.4 + 0.5 = 0.9 gallons. The total mixture is 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 gallons. 0.9 divided by 1.5 is 0.6, which is 60%. Yep, that works.\n\nLooking at the options, 0.5 is option A. So the answer should be A.\n",

I need to find out how much additional orange juice must be mixed in to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink.\n\nWait, wait. So initially, the soft drink is 40% orange juice. That means in one gallon, the orange juice is 0.4 gallons, right? Because 40% of 1 gallon is 0.4. And the rest is water, so 0.6 gallons.\n\nNow, the goal is to have orange juice make up 60% of the soft drink. So I need to adjust the mixture by adding more orange juice. Let's think about how this works. When I add more orange juice, the total volume of the soft drink increases, but the amount of water stays the same because I'm only adding orange juice.\n\nSo let me set up some variables. Let's say I add x gallons of orange juice. After adding, the total volume becomes (1 + x) gallons. The amount of orange juice becomes (0.4 + x) gallons because I'm adding x gallons to the existing 0.4.\n\nWe want the orange juice to be 60% of the new mixture. So the equation would be:\n\n(0.4 + x) = 0.6 * (1 + x)\n\nHmm, let's solve this equation. Expanding the right side:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nNow, subtract 0.4x from both sides to get the x terms on one side:\n\n0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me subtract 0.6x from both sides:\n\n0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\nThen, subtract 0.4 from both sides:\n\n0.4x = 0.6 - 0.4\n\n0.4x = 0.2\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.4:\n\nx = 0.2 / 0.4\n\nx = 0.5\n\nWait, so x is 0.5 gallons. So I need to add half a gallon of orange juice. Looking at the options, option A is 0.5. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes when mixing, especially when changing percentages, it's easy to get confused.\n\nLet me think again. Starting with 1 gallon, 0.4 OJ, 0.6 water. Adding 0.5 OJ. Now total OJ is 0.4 + 0.5 = 0.9. Total volume is 1.5 gallons. 0.9 /1.5 = 0.6, which is 60%. Yep, that works.
