      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nA man wants to eat fruit for breakfast and vegetables for dinner. He has 6 different types of fruit and 8 different types of vegetables. He can only eat one type at a time. The question is asking in how many ways he can eat breakfast and dinner. The options are A)54, B)24, C)48, D)20, E)36.\n\nHmm, so I think this is a combinatorics problem, probably involving permutations or combinations. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, he's choosing one fruit for breakfast and one vegetable for dinner. So he has two separate choices here. The key is that each choice is independent of the other because what he picks for breakfast doesn't affect what he can pick for dinner, right?\n\nSo for breakfast, he has 6 options. Each of those 6 fruits can be paired with any of the vegetables for dinner. Oh wait, wait. No, wait. No, the vegetables are for dinner, and he's choosing one vegetable. So for each fruit choice, how many vegetable options are there?\n\nHe has 8 different vegetables. So for each fruit, he can pair it with any of the 8 vegetables. So the total number of possible combinations would be the number of fruits multiplied by the number of vegetables. Because for each fruit, there are 8 possibilities.\n\nWait, let me make sure. So 6 fruits times 8 vegetables. 6 times 8 is 48. So the total number of ways is 48. Let me look at the options. Option C is 48. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but another thought: does the order matter here? Like, is breakfast and dinner considered a sequence? Because he's choosing one fruit and one vegetable, but the order is fixed\u2014breakfast first, then dinner. So each combination is a unique way, right? So the multiplication applies.\n\nAlternatively, if he were choosing two things where order didn't matter, like if he were selecting two items without considering the time of day, then it might be a combination. But in this case, it's two different meals, so the order is important in the sense that breakfast is one choice and dinner is another, but in terms of counting the possibilities, each is a separate selection.\n\nSo yeah, I think it's just 6 * 8 = 48. So the answer is C)48.\n",

The question is asking how many ways he can eat breakfast and dinner, considering he can only eat one type at a time.\n\nHmm, so the man has two meals: breakfast and dinner. For breakfast, he picks a fruit, and for dinner, a vegetable. Each meal is a separate choice. I remember something about combinatorics and the counting principle, maybe the rule of product?\n\nWait, the rule of product says that if there are m ways to do something and n ways to do another thing, then there are m \u00d7 n ways to do both. So here, the number of choices for breakfast is the number of fruits, which is 6. The number of choices for dinner is the number of vegetables, which is 8.\n\nSo for each fruit he picks, he can pair it with any of the 8 vegetables. So the total number of combinations would be 6 multiplied by 8. Let me calculate that: 6 * 8 is 48. That seems straightforward.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 48. So that's probably the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says he can only eat one type at a time, but since he's choosing one fruit and one vegetable, that condition is already satisfied. So yeah, it's just the product of the two choices.\n",
