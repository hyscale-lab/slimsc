      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question is about an organization raising a certain amount of money by collecting equal contributions from each employee. There are two scenarios given, and I need to find out how many employees there are.\n\nThe first part says the organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh. Each employee contributes an equal amount. Let's call the number of employees 'n' and the contribution per employee 'x'. So, the total contribution is n multiplied by x, which equals 6 lakh. So, the equation would be n * x = 6,00,000. That's straightforward.\n\nThe second part says that if each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. Hmm, okay. So, in this case, each employee contributes x + 60. And the total is now 6.24 lakh. So, the equation here is n * (x + 60) = 6,24,000.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) n * x = 6,00,000\n2) n * (x + 60) = 6,24,000\n\nI can solve these equations to find n. Let me see. Maybe I can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate some variables. Let's try that.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\nn*(x + 60) - n*x = 6,24,000 - 6,00,000\n\nSimplify the left side: n*x + 60n - n*x = 60n. The right side is 24,000.\n\nSo, 60n = 24,000. Now, to find n, divide both sides by 60.\n\nn = 24,000 / 60. Let me calculate that. 24,000 divided by 60. Well, 60 times 400 is 24,000, right? Because 60 * 400 = 24,000. So, n is 400.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So the number of employees is 400. Looking at the options, option C is 400. So the answer should be C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes I might mix up the numbers or make an arithmetic error.\n\nSo, first equation: n*x = 6,00,000. Second equation: n*(x+60) = 6,24,000.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from 2 gives n*(x+60 -x) = 6,24,000 -6,00,000. So that's n*60 = 24,000. Dividing both sides by 60, n = 24,000 /60 = 400. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to approach it: Let's say the number of employees is n. The first contribution per employee is x. So, x = 6,00,000 /n. In the second case, each contributes x+60, so total is n*(x+60) = 6,24,000.\n\nSubstituting x from the first equation into the second: n*( (6,00,000/n) +60 ) = 6,24,000.\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses: (6,00,000/n +60) = (6,00,000 +60n)/n.\n\nSo, n * (6,00,000 +60n)/n = 6,24,000.\n\nThe n in the numerator and denominator cancel out. So, 6,00,000 +60n =6,24,000.\n\nSubtract 6,00,000 from both sides: 60n =24,000. So again, n=24,000/60=400.\n\nYep, same result. So I'm confident that the correct answer is 400, which is option C.\n",

Then, if each contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. And the question is, how many employees are there?\n\nHmm. I think I should start by setting up some variables. Let me think. Let's say the number of employees is 'n'. And the original contribution each person made is 'x' rupees. So, from each employee, they give x rupees. Then, the total amount collected is n times x, right? So, n * x = 6 lakh.\n\nWait, 6 lakh is 600,000, right? Because 1 lakh is 100,000. So, 6 lakh is 600,000 rupees. So, equation one is n * x = 600,000.\n\nNow, the second scenario: each contributes Rs. 60 more. So, each contributes (x + 60) rupees. And the total then is n * (x + 60) = 6.24 lakh. Which is 624,000 rupees. So equation two is n*(x +60)=624,000.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) n * x = 600,000\n2) n * (x + 60) = 624,000\n\nI think I can subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate some variables. Let me try that.\n\nEquation 2 minus equation 1: n*(x +60) - n*x = 624,000 - 600,000.\n\nSimplify the left side: n*x + 60n - n*x = 60n.\n\nRight side: 24,000.\n\nSo, 60n = 24,000.\n\nWait, so n = 24,000 / 60. Let me compute that. 24,000 divided by 60. Hmm, 60 goes into 24,000 how many times? Let me think: 60 * 400 is 24,000, because 60 * 400 = 24,000. So n is 400.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If n is 400, then the original contribution x would be 600,000 / 400. 600,000 divided by 400 is 1,500. So each employee contributed 1,500 rupees. If they each contributed 60 more, that's 1,560 each. 400 * 1,560 is 624,000, which matches the second condition. So yeah, that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 400. So the answer should be C.\n",
