      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about two balls rotating on a circular track. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.\n\nAlright, the problem says Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. They start at the same point, and I need to find when they'll both be back at the starting point again.\n\nHmm, so each ball has its own rotation period. I think the key here is to find when both balls complete an integer number of rotations so they end up back where they started. That probably means finding a common multiple of their rotation periods.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think about their rotation periods first. Rotation period is the time it takes to make one full rotation. So for Ball A, if it does 2 rotations in 26 minutes, then each rotation takes 26/2 = 13 minutes. So the period of Ball A is 13 minutes per rotation.\n\nBall B does 5 rotations in 35 minutes, so each rotation is 35/5 = 7 minutes. So its period is 7 minutes per rotation.\n\nNow, I need to find when both will be at the starting point again. That would be the least common multiple (LCM) of their periods. Because LCM gives the smallest time when both events coincide.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, no. Let me think again. Because each ball returns to the start after a certain time. For Ball A, it returns every 13 minutes. For Ball B, every 7 minutes. So the LCM of 13 and 7 would give the time when both are back at the start at the same time.\n\nBut wait, 13 and 7 are both prime numbers. So their LCM is 13*7 = 91 minutes.\n\nWait, 91 minutes is how many hours? 91 divided by 60 is 1 hour with 31 minutes remaining. So 1 hour and 31 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 1 hour and 31 minutes. So that's the answer?\n\nWait, but wait. I think I made a mistake. Because the way the problem is set up, I should check if both balls complete full rotations at the same time. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the LCM approach is correct because it's the smallest time where both have integer number of rotations. So yes, 91 minutes is the time. That's 1 hour (60 minutes) plus 31 minutes, so 1:31.\n\nSo the answer should be option A.\n\nBut let me double-check. Let me see how many rotations each does in 91 minutes.\n\nBall A: 91 /13 = 7 rotations. So yes, it's back at start.\n\nBall B: 91 /7 =13 rotations. Also back at start.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the first time they meet again is at 91 minutes, which is 1h 31m. So option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine when both balls A and B will return to the starting point simultaneously, we first calculate their rotation periods.
