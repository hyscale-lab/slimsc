      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Julie's yard. Hmm, the yard is rectangular, right? And one side is 100 feet wide. The total area is 3,000 square feet. I need to find the length of the other side.\n\nWait, area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying length and width. Oh right, so the formula is area = length \u00d7 width. But wait, in this case, which side is the length and which is the width? Oh, I think it doesn't really matter because multiplication is commutative. So whether I call 100 feet the length or the width, the other dimension will be the same.\n\nSo, Julie's yard has an area of 3,000 sq ft. One side is 100 ft. Let me write that down. So, area = 3,000 = 100 \u00d7 other side. Oh wait, so I can rearrange the formula to find the other side. Other side = area / 100.\n\nCalculating that, 3,000 divided by 100. Let me do that division. 3000 \u00f7 100 is 30. So the other side is 30 feet. Looking at the options, option A is 30 feet. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If the sides are 100 and 30, then 100 \u00d7 30 is 3,000. Yep, that matches the given area. So I'm confident that option A is correct.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the length of the other side of Julie's rectangular yard, we use the formula for the area of a rectangle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}.\n\\]\n\nGiven that one side of the yard is 100 feet and the total area is 3,000 square feet, we can solve for the other side.

So I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width. The formula is area equals length times width, or A = l * w.\n\nThe problem says one side is 100 feet wide. Wait, so that's the width. And the total area is 3,000 square feet. I need to find the length of the other side. Oh right, because in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so if one side is 100 feet, the opposite is also 100. But the other two sides are the lengths we're looking for.\n\nSo, let me plug the numbers into the formula. The area is 3,000, which equals length times width. The width is given as 100 feet. So, 3,000 = l * 100. I think I can solve for l by dividing both sides by 100. Let me do that: 3,000 divided by 100 is 30. So the length must be 30 feet.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, A is 30.
