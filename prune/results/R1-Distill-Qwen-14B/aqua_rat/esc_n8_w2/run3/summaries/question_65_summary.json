      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Amy has 10 different types of books, and she wants to code each with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. The goal is to find the smallest number of letters she needs to create all these codes uniquely. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about this. So each code is either one letter or two letters. And the order in the pair doesn't matter, so AB is the same as BA. So for pairs, it's a combination, not permutation.\n\nWait, so first, how many unique codes can she make with a certain number of letters, say n letters. She can use single letters, which would be n options. Then for pairs, since order doesn't matter, the number of possible pairs is n choose 2, which is n(n-1)/2.\n\nSo the total number of codes she can make is n (for single letters) + [n(n-1)/2] (for pairs). Because each code is either a single or a pair, and all are unique.\n\nAmy needs at least 10 codes. So we need to find the smallest n such that n + [n(n-1)/2] \u2265 10.\n\nLet me try plugging in the options given. The options are 3,4,5,10,20.\n\nWait, let me compute for each possible n:\n\nn=3:\nSingle letters:3\nPairs: 3*2/2 =3. So total codes=3+3=6. That's less than 10. Not enough.\n\nn=4:\nSingles:4\nPairs:4*3/2=6. Total codes=4+6=10. Oh, exactly 10. So 4 letters would give exactly 10 codes. So that's enough. So the answer might be 4, which is option B.\n\nWait, but what about n=3: gives 6, which is less than 10. So n=4 is the first n that meets the requirement. So the minimal number is 4.\n\nSo the correct answer is B)4.\n",

And the order in the pair doesn't matter, right? So like, AB is the same as BA. Oh, that's important because it affects how many unique pairs we can have.\n\nI think the approach here is to figure out how many unique codes we can make with a certain number of letters. Let's say Amy uses N letters. Then the number of single-letter codes she can have is N. The number of two-letter codes would be the combination of N letters taken 2 at a time, which is N choose 2, or N*(N-1)/2.\n\nSo the total number of unique codes possible is N (single letters) plus N choose 2 (pairs). We need this total to be at least 10, because there are 10 books.\n\nLet me try plugging in some numbers. Let's start with option A, which is 3. So N=3. Single letters: 3. Pairs: 3C2 is 3. So total is 3+3=6. That's only 6 codes, which isn't enough for 10 books. So A is too small.\n\nNext, option B is 4 letters. Single letters: 4. Pairs: 4C2 is 6. Total is 4+6=10. Oh, exactly 10. That's perfect. So with 4 letters, Amy can make 10 unique codes. But wait, the question says she can use either a single letter or a pair. So each book can choose either a single or a pair. So if she uses exactly 4 letters, and uses all possible single letters and pairs, that's 10 codes. So that should work.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If she uses 4 letters, each book can be assigned a code. Since she has 10 books, each code must be unique. So 4 letters can give exactly 10 codes. That's enough. So the smallest number is 4, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, is there a possibility that using 4 letters would not be enough? Let me make sure. If she uses 4 letters, how many possible codes do we have? 4 single letters and 6 pairs. So 10 in total. So if she needs exactly 10 codes, 4 letters are sufficient. So the answer must be B)4.\n",
