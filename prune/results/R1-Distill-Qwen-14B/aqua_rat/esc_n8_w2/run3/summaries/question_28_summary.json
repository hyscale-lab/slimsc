      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a computer routine that generates two numbers, x and y. The first number, x, is a random number between 0 and 100, inclusive. The second number, y, has to be less than or equal to the square root of x. The question is asking which pair of numbers doesn't satisfy this routine. The options are A through E.\n\nLet me think through each option step by step. \n\nFirst, I'll list out each pair (x, y):\n\nA) (99,10)\nB) (85,9)\nC) (50,7)\nD) (1,1)\nE) (1,0)\n\nI need to check for each pair whether y is less than or equal to the square root of x.\n\nStarting with option A: (99,10)\nWhat's the square root of 99? Hmm, I know that 10 squared is 100, so sqrt(99) is just a little less than 10. Let me calculate it approximately. 9.949... So sqrt(99) \u22489.949. The y here is 10. So is 10 <= 9.949? No, because 10 is bigger. Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute. Because the square root of 99 is about 9.949, so 10 is larger. That would mean that y is greater than sqrt(x). So this pair wouldn't satisfy the condition. Wait, but the question says each pair except one satisfies the routine. So A is a candidate for the exception.\n\nBut let me check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption B: (85,9)\nWhat's sqrt(85)? Let's see. 9 squared is 81, 10 squared is 100. So sqrt(85) is between 9 and 10. Let me compute 9^2=81, 9.2^2=84.64, 9.3^2=86.49. So sqrt(85) is approximately 9.2195. So y is 9, which is less than 9.2195. So 9 <=9.2195 is true. So B is okay.\n\nOption C: (50,7)\nsqrt(50) is about 7.071, right? Because 7^2 is 49, 7.1^2 is 50.41. So sqrt(50)=~7.071. y is 7. So 7 <=7.071 is true. So C is okay.\n\nOption D: (1,1)\nsqrt(1)=1. So y is 1. 1<=1 is true. So D is okay.\n\nOption E: (1,0)\nsqrt(1)=1. y is 0, which is <=1. So E is okay.\n\nWait, so according to this, A is the one that doesn't satisfy because y=10 is greater than sqrt(99)=~9.949. So option A is the exception.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the square roots to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nsqrt(99) is indeed less than 10, correct. 10^2 is 100. So 99's square root is less than 10. So y=10 is greater than sqrt(99), which would mean the condition y <= sqrt(x) is not met. So option A is the one that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but the question says each pair satisfies the routine except one. So the correct answer is option A.\n",

Wait, but the condition is that y should be less than or equal to the square root. So in this case, 10 is not less than 9.949, so this pair wouldn't satisfy the routine.
