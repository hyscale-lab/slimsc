      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question here about choosing oranges from a basket. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question says there are 10 oranges in a basket, and we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges. The options are A)45, B)90, C)120, D)150, E)180.\n\nWait, I remember something about combinations from math class. Oh right, combinations are used when the order doesn't matter. Like, choosing 2 oranges is the same as choosing any other 2, regardless of the order. So if I pick orange 1 and then orange 2, that's the same as picking orange 2 first and then orange 1. So combinations are the way to go here.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number we're choosing. In this case, n is 10 and k is 2.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. So C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10-2)! ) which simplifies to 10! / (2! * 8! ). \n\nWait, I can simplify this further because 10! is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8! So when I divide by 8! it cancels out. So now it's (10 \u00d7 9) / (2 \u00d7 1). That's 90 divided by 2, which is 45.\n\nSo the number of ways is 45. Looking back at the options, that's option A. \n\nI think that's it. The other options are much larger numbers, but since we're choosing just 2 from 10, 45 makes sense. I don't think I missed anything here. Yeah, I'm pretty confident the answer is A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10, we use combinations since the order of selection does not matter.

The options are A)45, B)90, C)120, D)150, E)180.\n\nWait, right, this sounds like a combinations problem. Oh yeah, combinations are used when the order doesn't matter. Because when you're choosing two oranges, it doesn't matter which one you pick first or second; the pair is the same either way.\n\nSo the formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! divided by (k! times (n-k)! ). So n is 10 here, and k is 2.\n\nLet me compute that. 10 choose 2 is 10! / (2! * (10-2)! ) \u2192 which simplifies to (10*9*8! ) / (2*1 * 8! ). Oh wait, the 8! cancels out from numerator and denominator. So it's (10*9)/(2*1) = 90/2 = 45. So the answer should be 45, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I do that right? Because sometimes I get confused between combinations and permutations. Oh right, combinations are when order doesn't matter. If the question was about permutations, like arranging the oranges in order, then it would be 10*9=90, which is option B. But since it's just choosing two, the order doesn't matter, so combinations are correct here.\n\nSo yeah, the answer should be 45. Looking at the options, A is 45.
