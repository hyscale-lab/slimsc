      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a picket fence. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking about the total length of the fence in feet. The fence is straight and made up of x pickets, each 1/2 inch wide. And between each pair of pickets, there are 6 inches of space. I need to figure out which option correctly represents the length.\n\nWait, so each picket is 1/2 inch wide. So for x pickets, the total width from the pickets alone would be x multiplied by 1/2. But wait, how about the spaces between them? Oh right, because between each pair of pickets, there's a 6-inch space. So if there are x pickets, how many spaces are there? Hmm, if I have two pickets, there's one space between them. So for x pickets, the number of spaces would be x minus 1. Because the number of gaps between items is always one less than the number of items. Like, three pickets have two spaces between them.\n\nSo, the total length contributed by the spaces is (x-1) multiplied by 6 inches. Then, add the total width of the pickets. So the total length in inches would be (x * 1/2) + ( (x-1) *6 ). \n\nLet me compute that. Let's see:\n\nPickets: x * (1/2) = x/2 inches.\nSpaces: (x-1) *6 = 6(x-1) inches.\nTotal inches = x/2 + 6x -6.\n\nWait, let me add those terms. x/2 is 0.5x, and 6x is 6x. So 0.5x +6x is 6.5x, which is 13x/2. But wait, I have the -6 from the 6(x-1) which is 6x -6. So adding that: 13x/2 -6 inches.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the length in feet. So I need to convert inches to feet. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, I divide by 12.\n\nSo total feet = (13x/2 -6) / 12.\n\nWait, let me write that as a single fraction. That would be (13x -12)/24. Because 13x/2 divided by 12 is 13x/(2*12) = 13x/24. And 6 divided by 12 is 0.5, which is 1/2, so 6/12 is 1/2. So subtracting that, it's (13x/24) - (1/2). Hmm, but wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, (13x/2 -6) inches is equal to (13x/2 -6)/12 feet. Let's compute that:\n\n(13x/2 -6) /12 = [ (13x -12) ] / (2 *12) ) = (13x -12)/24.\n\nWait, because 13x/2 divided by 12 is 13x/(2*12) =13x/24. And 6 divided by 12 is 0.5, which is 1/2. So, subtract 6/12 which is 0.5, so the whole expression is (13x/24) - (1/2). But wait, 1/2 is 12/24. So 13x/24 -12/24 = (13x -12)/24. So that's the total length in feet.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is (13x -12)/24. So that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I get the number of spaces right? For example, if x=1, then the fence is just one picket. So the length should be 0.5 inches, which is 0.5/12 feet. Let's plug x=1 into option E: (13*1 -12)/24 = (1)/24, which is approximately 0.041666... feet. Which is 0.5 inches. That's correct.\n\nAnother test: x=2. Two pickets, each 0.5 inches, so 1 inch total. And one space of 6 inches. So total length is 7 inches. Which is 7/12 feet. Let's see what E gives: (26-12)/24 =14/24=7/12. Correct.\n\nSo yes, option E is correct.\n",

Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. I need to find the length of the fence in feet, and then choose the correct option from A to E.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. I think I should first visualize the fence. It's made up of multiple pickets with spaces between them. So each picket is 1/2 inch wide, and the space between two adjacent pickets is 6 inches.\n\nWait, so if there are x pickets, how many spaces are there between them? Oh right, for x pickets, the number of spaces between them is x-1. Because, like, if you have two pickets, there's one space between them. Three pickets have two spaces, and so on.\n\nSo the total length of the fence would be the sum of the widths of all the pickets plus the sum of all the spaces between them.\n\nLet me write that out. The total width from the pickets is x multiplied by 1/2 inch. Because each picket is 1/2 inch, and there are x of them.\n\nThen, the total space between the pickets is (x - 1) multiplied by 6 inches. Because each space is 6 inches, and there are (x-1) spaces.\n\nSo the total length in inches is (x * 1/2) + ((x - 1) * 6). \n\nLet me compute that:\n\nx * 1/2 = x/2 inches.\n(x-1)*6 = 6x -6 inches.\n\nAdding those together: x/2 + 6x -6.\n\nWait, let's combine like terms. x/2 +6x is the same as (0.5x +6x) which is 6.5x. So 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nBut wait, 6.5 is the same as 13/2. So that's (13x/2) -6 inches.\n\nBut the question asks for the length in feet. Oh right, because 1 foot is 12 inches. So I need to convert the total inches into feet by dividing by 12.\n\nSo the total length in feet is [(13x/2) -6 ] / 12.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's write it as [(13x/2 -6)] /12.\n\nI can split this into two terms: (13x/2) /12 and 6/12.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n(13x/2)/12 = 13x/(2*12) = 13x/24.\n\n6/12 is 0.5 or 1/2. Wait, but in the numerator, it's minus 6, so when I divide by 12, it's -6/12 which is -0.5 or -1/2.\n\nSo putting it together, the total length is (13x/24) - 0.5 feet.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, I don't see an option that looks like 13x/24 minus 0.5. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA)13x/2\nB)13x/2 - 6\nC)13x/24\nD)(13x+1)/24\nE)(13x-12)/24\n\nHmm. None of them have a 13x/24 minus 0.5. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me retrace. The total in inches is (13x/2 -6). To convert to feet, I divide by 12. So (13x/2 -6) divided by 12.\n\nWhich is (13x/2)/12 - 6/12. That's 13x/(24) - 0.5. So in feet, it's (13x/24) - 0.5.\n\nBut none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the number of spaces. Let me think again: x pickets have (x-1) spaces between them. So that part was correct.\n\nSo the total inches: (x * 1/2) + (x-1)*6 = (x/2 +6x -6) = (6.5x -6) inches.\n\nConvert to feet: (6.5x -6) inches is (6.5x -6)/12 feet.\n\n6.5 is 13/2, so (13x/2 -6)/12.\n\nWhich is (13x/2)/12 -6/12 = 13x/(24) - 0.5.\n\nSo that's 13x/24 minus 0.5 feet.\n\nBut looking at the options again:\n\nOption E is (13x-12)/24.
