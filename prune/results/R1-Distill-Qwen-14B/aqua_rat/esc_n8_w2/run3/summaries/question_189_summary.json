They need to be served among two different groups of customers, each consisting of 5 members. How many ways are there to create these two groups?\n\nHmm, okay, so the problem is about dividing ten bottles into two groups of five each. But wait, the groups are different, meaning they're distinguishable. So I think this is a combinations problem. \n\nWait, but when you split a set into two groups, sometimes you have to be careful about whether the groups are labeled or not. Like, if the two groups are different (like group A and group B), then the order matters. But if they're the same, like just splitting into two, then it's different.\n\nIn this case, the problem says there are two different groups of customers. So each group is distinct. So maybe I don't have to divide by anything. Let me think.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 5 people out of 10 is C(10,5). Because the first group is 5, and the second group is the remaining 5. But wait, since the groups are different, each selection counts as a unique arrangement.\n\nSo C(10,5) is 252. Let me calculate that. 10 choose 5 is 252. So that's the number of ways to split into two groups of five each.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to look at this? Because sometimes when you split into groups, if the groups are indistinct, you have to divide by the number of ways the groups can be swapped. But here, the groups are different, so we don't have to do that.\n\nSo for example, if the groups were labeled as group 1 and group 2, then each division counts as unique. So the total is indeed 252.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 252. So I think the answer is D.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: how many ways to assign each bottle to one of the two groups. Each bottle can go to group A or group B. But since each group must have exactly five, that's the same as choosing 5 out of 10, which is 252.\n\nAlternatively, if the groups were not labeled, it would be C(10,5)/2 because each split is counted twice (once as group A and group B, once as group B and group A). But since they're different, we don't divide by 2.\n\nSo yeah, the answer should be 252, which is option D.\n",
