      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit confused about how to approach it, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see, the question is about finding the average speed of a man who walks at different speeds for different durations. \n\nHmm, I remember that average speed isn't just the average of the speeds; instead, it's the total distance divided by the total time. Oh right, because average speed is total distance traveled over the total time taken. So I need to calculate how far he walked in each part of his journey and then add them together, and then divide by the total time he spent walking.\n\nAlright, so let's break it down. The man walks at two different speeds. First, he walks at 5 km/h for 6 hours. Then, he walks at 4 km/h for 12 hours. So I'll compute the distance for each part.\n\nFor the first part: distance equals speed multiplied by time. So 5 km/h times 6 hours. Let me calculate that. 5 * 6 is 30. So the distance for the first part is 30 km.\n\nNext, the second part: 4 km/h for 12 hours. So 4 * 12 equals 48. So the distance for the second part is 48 km.\n\nNow, the total distance he walked is the sum of these two distances. That would be 30 km plus 48 km, which adds up to 78 km. Okay, so total distance is 78 km.\n\nWhat about the total time he spent? He walked for 6 hours and then 12 hours. Adding those together: 6 + 12 = 18 hours. So total time is 18 hours.\n\nNow, to find the average speed, I take the total distance and divide by the total time. So that's 78 km divided by 18 hours. Let me do that division. Hmm, 78 divided by 18. Let's see, 18 times 4 is 72, which leaves 6. So 4 with a remainder of 6. So 4 and 6/18, which simplifies to 4 and 1/3. Because 6 divided by 18 is 1/3.\n\nSo the average speed is 4 and 1/3 km/h. Looking at the options, option A is 4 1/3 km/h. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in adding or multiplying somewhere. \n\nFirst part: 5 km/h * 6 h = 30 km. Correct. Second part: 4 * 12 is 48, yes. 30 +48=78, that's right. Time: 6+12=18, correct. 78/18. Let me compute that again. 18 *4=72, 78-72=6. So 4 and 6/18=4.333... which is 4 and 1/3. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo the answer should be option A.\n",
