      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about how many bottles of soda Jill needs to buy for a party. Hmm, okay. \n\nSo, the first part says that for a party with 8 people, she bought 10 bottles. And now she's having a party with 12 people, and we need to find out how many bottles she needs this time. The options are from A to E, with numbers 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14.\n\nWait, let me think. How do I approach this? Well, maybe it's a ratio problem. So, first, I should figure out how much soda each person drinks on average. Because if I can find that, then I can scale it up for more people.\n\nIn the first scenario, 8 people attended, and she bought 10 bottles. So, per person, that's 10 divided by 8. Let me calculate that. 10 divided by 8 equals 1.25. Oh, so each person drinks 1.25 bottles on average. That seems a bit high, but maybe it's because sometimes people have more than one drink. Or perhaps the soda bottles are small. Or maybe it's just a rough estimate.\n\nSo, if each person drinks 1.25 bottles, then for 12 people, she would need 12 multiplied by 1.25. Let me do that math. 12 times 1 is 12, and 12 times 0.25 is 3. So 12 +3 =15. Wait, but looking at the options, there's no 15. Hmm, did I do something wrong?\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the question isn't about per person consumption. Maybe it's more about the ratio of attendees. Let me try another approach. Let's see, 8 people needed 10 bottles. So 8:10. Simplifying that ratio, divide both by 2. So 4:5. So for every 4 people, she needs 5 bottles. \n\nNow, the new number of people is 12. How many groups of 4 are there in 12? 12 divided by 4 is 3. So each group of 4 needs 5 bottles. So 3 groups would need 3 times 5, which is 15 bottles. But again, the options don't have 15. The highest is 14. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the initial data. Let me read the question again. \"Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended.\" So, 8 people, 10 bottles. So perhaps the rate is 10 bottles for 8 people, which is 10/8 = 1.25 per person. But that leads to 15, which isn't an option. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a direct proportion. So, if 8 people need 10 bottles, 12 people would need X bottles. So setting up a proportion: 8/10 = 12/X. Wait, no, because more people would require more bottles. So actually, the proportion should be 8:10 as 12:X, but in terms of ratios, perhaps. Let me think. Wait, actually, the correct proportion would be 8 people correspond to 10 bottles, so 1 person corresponds to 10/8 bottles. Therefore, 12 people would correspond to 12*(10/8) = 15 bottles. But again, 15 isn't an option.\n\nHmm, the options given are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the initial assumption. Perhaps she only bought 10 bottles because 8 people attended, but maybe she didn't drink all of them. Or perhaps it's a different kind of ratio. Wait, another thought: perhaps each person drinks one bottle, and there are some extra. Let me think again. If 8 people had 10 bottles, maybe each person drinks a little more than one. Or perhaps she bought 10 bottles for 8, meaning each person had 1 bottle, and there were 2 extra. So perhaps she's planning for 1 bottle per person, plus some extras.\n\nWait, if that's the case, then for 12 people, she would need 12 bottles. So D)12 is an option. But wait, in the first case, 8 people had 10 bottles. So 8 people, 10 bottles: that's 1.25 per person. But if I'm assuming that each person only drinks 1 bottle, then for 12 people, she needs 12. But that's conflicting with the initial data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is more straightforward. Maybe it's a direct proportion, but perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let's try to set it up as a proportion.\n\nSo, if 8 people require 10 bottles, then 12 people would require X bottles.\n\nSo, 8 people : 10 bottles = 12 people : X bottles\n\nSo, 8/10 = 12/X \u2192 cross-multiplying, 8X = 10 * 12 \u2192 8X=120 \u2192 X=120/8=15. So again, 15. But that's not an option. So maybe the initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about how much soda per person, but perhaps the number is the same per person, not based on the initial. Or perhaps it's a different way of looking at it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is assuming that each person drinks one bottle. So, if 8 people came, she bought 10. But that doesn't make sense because 8 people would need 8 bottles if each drinks one. So why 10? Unless she had leftovers or more. So perhaps in the first case, she had 2 extra bottles. So for 12 people, she would need 12 + 2 =14. Oh wait, because 10 is 8 +2. So 8 people, 10 bottles: 8 + 2 extra. So for 12 people, 12 + 2 =14. So that would be option E)14.\n\nBut wait, that's an assumption. The question doesn't explicitly state that she buys two extra for any party. So that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the number of bottles is the same as the number of attendees. But in the first case, she bought more than the number of people. So 10 bottles for 8 people. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial 10 bottles were just for the 8 people, so each person had 1.25 bottles, but perhaps she wants to ensure that each person has at least one, and then some. So for 12 people, she might buy 12 plus some extra. But again, this is speculative.\n\nWait, maybe the question is trying to say that 8 people required 10 bottles, so perhaps each person consumes 1.25 bottles. So for 12 people, 12 *1.25=15, but since 15 isn't an option, perhaps she can't buy partial bottles, so she rounds up. But the options don't include 15.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's see the options again. The options are 6,8,10,12,14.\n\nWait, 10 bottles for 8 people. So per person, 10/8 =1.25. So for 12 people, 12 *1.25=15, but since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the number of bottles per person being the same as the first party. So, if 8 people had 10 bottles, perhaps each person had 1 bottle, and there were 2 extra. So for 12 people, she needs 12 + 2 =14, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, that's not a given. The initial data is 8 people, 10 bottles. So if each person had one, there are 2 left. But without knowing the exact consumption, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps she bought 10 bottles because she thought 8 people would need that, but maybe she's just using a fixed number, like 10, regardless of the number of people. But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a different number based on the number of attendees.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the same number of bottles regardless of the number of people. But that can't be because 8 people had 10 bottles, and 12 would need more.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is a proportion problem but in a different way. Let me see. The first time, 8 people, 10 bottles. So the ratio of people to bottles is 8:10, which simplifies to 4:5. So for every 4 people, 5 bottles. So for 12 people, how many groups of 4 are there? 12/4=3. So each group of 4 needs 5 bottles. 3 groups would need 3 *5=15. Again, 15 isn't an option.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm making a mistake in the ratio approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that each person drinks one bottle, and any leftovers are negligible. So for 8 people, 8 bottles. But she bought 10, which is 2 more. So for 12 people, she needs 12 + 2 =14. That would be option E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different approach. Let's think about the number of additional people. The first party had 8 people, the second has 12. So that's 4 more people. If each additional person requires 1.25 bottles, then 4 people would require 5 bottles. So 10 +5=15, which again isn't an option.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the same number of bottles, so 10. But that can't be because more people would need more bottles. So that's not logical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick, and the answer is the same as the number of people. So 12 people, 12 bottles. So D)12. But in the first case, 8 people had 10 bottles, which is less than 8. So that doesn't add up. Unless she was more efficient the second time.\n\nWait, maybe the first time she had 8 people and 10 bottles, which is 1.25 per person. The second time, she might buy 12 bottles for 12 people, which is 1 per person. But that's not consistent with the initial data.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach it from another angle. Let's think about the possible answers and see which makes sense.\n\nOption E is 14. So if 8 people need 10, and 12 people need 14, that's an increase of 4 people leading to an increase of 4 bottles. So 4 more people, 4 more bottles. So that's 1 bottle per additional person. So from 8 to 12 is 4 more, so 10 +4=14. That would be option E. So that's a possible approach.\n\nBut why would the number of bottles increase by the same number as the number of people? Because in the first case, 8 people, 10 bottles. So 8 +2=10. Then, 12 +2=14. So she adds 2 bottles regardless of the number of people. But that's an assumption not stated in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she adds 1.25 bottles per person, but the options don't have 15. So perhaps the answer isn't based on exact calculation but on the options given. Let me see, the options are 6,8,10,12,14.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the number of bottles per person being 10/8=1.25. So for 12 people, 12 *1.25=15. But since 15 isn't an option, maybe the closest higher number is 14, which is E. But that's not precise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer to be the same as the number of people, so 12. But that doesn't fit the initial data.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as a proportion where 8 people correspond to 10 bottles. So 8 people:10 bottles =12 people:X bottles.\n\nSo cross-multiplying: 8X=10*12 \u2192 8X=120 \u2192 X=15. But 15 isn't an option. So perhaps the answer expects us to round down to the nearest option, but 15 isn't there. So maybe the answer is 14, but that's not based on a precise calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be a simple ratio without considering fractions. So 8 people need 10 bottles. So per person, 10/8=1.25. But perhaps she can't buy a fraction of a bottle, so she rounds up. For 12 people, 12 *1.25=15. So she needs to buy 15, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct approach is to choose the next available option, which is E)14. But that's speculative.\n\nWait, another angle. Maybe the question is about the number of bottles per person. So 8 people had 10 bottles, which is 1.25 each. So for 12 people, 12 *1.25=15, but again, no option. So perhaps the answer is 14, as the closest higher number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is designed to have a trick, and the answer is 10, but that doesn't make sense because more people would need more bottles.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is D)12, because it's the number of people. So 12 people would need 12 bottles, but that doesn't fit the initial data. Because 8 people had 10 bottles, which is less than 8.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The problem says Jill needed to buy 10 bottles for 8 people. Now, for 12 people, how many bottles does she need? So the initial rate is 10 bottles per 8 people. So the rate is 10/8 = 1.25 bottles per person.\n\nSo for 12 people, 12 *1.25 =15 bottles. But that's not an option. So maybe the problem expects us to approximate or find a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be a unit rate problem. So, 10 bottles for 8 people. So per person, it's 1.25 bottles. So for 12 people, 15 bottles. But again, no option.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is E)14, as it's the closest higher number. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to note that the number of bottles is 10, regardless of the number of people. But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a different number based on the number of attendees.\n\nWait, another thought. Maybe the problem is about the number of guests, not including the host. So, if 8 people attended the first party, perhaps 7 guests plus the host. So 10 bottles for 8 people. Then, for 12 people, perhaps 11 guests plus the host, but that doesn't change much. But this line of thinking might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of bottles per person being the same as the first time. So, each person drinks 1.25 bottles. So for 12 people, 15. But no option.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the options again. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14.\n\nSo, 10 is the initial number, 8 is the original number of people. So perhaps the answer is 10, but that's only if the number of people doesn't affect the number of bottles. Which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that 10 bottles are needed for 8 people, implying that each person has one bottle, and two are left. So for 12 people, she would need 12 +2=14. So E)14.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. I think the intended answer might be E)14, but I'm not entirely confident.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a simple ratio problem. Let me set it up as a proportion.\n\nLet me write:\n\n8 people \u2192 10 bottles\n\n12 people \u2192 X bottles\n\nSo, 8/10 = 12/X \u2192 cross-multiplying: 8X = 120 \u2192 X=15.\n\nBut since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest option, which would be E)14.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a simple multiplication. 8 people:10 bottles. So per person, 10/8=1.25. 12 people would need 12 *1.25=15. But no option. So perhaps the answer is E)14, as the next higher number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is intended to have an answer of 12, which is D. Because 12 is the number of people, and maybe she buys one bottle per person. But in the first case, she bought 10 for 8, which is more than one per person.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure. But given the options, I think the intended answer is E)14. Because when you scale up from 8 to 12 people, you can calculate based on the same per-person rate, but since 15 isn't an option, 14 is the closest higher number. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 10, but that doesn't make sense with more people.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: Perhaps the number of bottles is directly proportional to the number of people, but with a base. So, 8 people \u219210 bottles. So, 10 -8=2. So, for each person, she adds 1.25 bottles. So, 12 people: 8 +4 more people. So 10 +4*1.25=10+5=15. Again, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps she buys 2 bottles for every person. So 8 people: 10 bottles \u2192 10/8=1.25, which is not 2. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved as a simple ratio, but the options don't have the correct number. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the number of bottles being 10, regardless of the number of people. But that can't be right because the number of people is changing.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to make a table.\n\nPeople | Bottles\n8      |10\n12     |?\n\nSo, 8\u219210. What's the relationship? 10 = (8 *1.25). So for 12, 12*1.25=15. But no option. So perhaps the intended answer is E)14.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that each person drinks 1 bottle, and she buys 2 extra. So for 8 people, 8+2=10. For 12 people, 12+2=14. So E)14.\n\nBut that's an assumption based on the initial data, but the problem doesn't state it explicitly.\n\nIn the absence of more information, perhaps the intended answer is E)14. So I'll go with that.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine how many bottles of soda Jill needs to buy for a party with 12 people, we start by analyzing the initial data: 8 people required 10 bottles of soda. This gives us a rate of soda consumption. \n\n### Step 1: Calculate the rate of soda consumption\nFor 8 people, 10 bottles were needed. The consumption rate per person is:\n\\[\n\\text{Rate} = \\frac{10 \\, \\text{bottles}}{8 \\, \\text{people}} = 1.25 \\, \\text{bottles per person}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Scale the rate to 12 people\nUsing the rate of 1.25 bottles per person, the total number of bottles needed for 12 people is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total bottles} = 12 \\times 1.25 = 15 \\, \\text{bottles}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the options\nThe options provided are:\n- A) 6\n- B) 8\n- C) 10\n- D) 12\n- E) 14\n\nSince 15 is not an option, we consider the closest higher number, which is 14. This suggests that the problem may be approximating or rounding down to the nearest available option.\n\n### Step 4: Verify alternative interpretations\nAnother possible interpretation is that Jill buys 2 extra bottles in addition to one bottle per person. For 8 people, this would mean:\n\\[\n8 \\, \\text{people} + 2 \\, \\text{extra bottles} = 10 \\, \\text{bottles}.\n\\]\nExtending this pattern, for 12 people:\n\\[\n12 \\, \\text{people} + 2 \\, \\text{extra bottles} = 14 \\, \\text{bottles}.\n\\]\n\nThis aligns with option E) 14.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the options and the reasoning above, the most reasonable answer is **E) 14**.\n\nAnswer: E",

The first time, 8 people, 10 bottles. So the ratio of people to bottles is 8:10, which simplifies to 4:5. So for every 4 people, 5 bottles. So for 12 people, how many groups of 4 are there? 12/4=3. So each group of 4 needs 5 bottles. 3 groups would need 3 *5=15. Again, 15 isn't an option.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm making a mistake in the ratio approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that each person drinks one bottle, and any leftovers are negligible. So for 8 people, 8 bottles. But she bought 10, which is 2 more. So for 12 people, she needs 12 + 2 =14. That would be option E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different approach. Let's think about the number of additional people. The first party had 8 people, the second has 12. So that's 4 more people. If each additional person requires 1.25 bottles, then 4 people would require 5 bottles. So 10 +5=15, which again isn't an option.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the same number of bottles, so 10. But that can't be because more people would need more bottles. So that's not logical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick, and the answer is the same as the number of people. So 12 people, 12 bottles. So D)12. But in the first case, 8 people had 10 bottles, which is less than 8. So that doesn't add up. Unless she was more efficient the second time.\n\nWait, maybe the first time she had 8 people and 10 bottles, which is 1.25 per person. The second time, she might buy 12 bottles for 12 people, which is 1 per person. But that's not consistent with the initial data.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach it from another angle. Let's think about the possible answers and see which makes sense.\n\nOption E is 14. So if 8 people need 10, and 12 people need 14, that's an increase of 4 people leading to an increase of 4 bottles. So 4 more people, 4 more bottles. So that's 1 bottle per additional person. So from 8 to 12 is 4 more, so 10 +4=14. That would be option E. So that's a possible approach.\n\nBut why would the number of bottles increase by the same number as the number of people? Because in the first case, 8 people, 10 bottles. So 8 +2=10. Then, 12 +2=14. So she adds 2 bottles regardless of the number of people. But that's an assumption not stated in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she adds 1.25 bottles per person, but the options don't have 15. So perhaps the answer isn't based on exact calculation but on the options given. Let me see, the options are 6,8,10,12,14.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the number of bottles per person being 10/8=1.25. So for 12 people, 12 *1.25=15. But since 15 isn't an option, maybe the closest higher number is 14, which is E. But that's not precise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer to be the same as the number of people, so 12. But that doesn't fit the initial data.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as a proportion where 8 people correspond to 10 bottles. So 8 people:10 bottles =12 people:X bottles.\n\nSo cross-multiplying: 8X=10*12 \u2192 8X=120 \u2192 X=15. But 15 isn't an option. So perhaps the answer expects us to round down to the nearest option, but 15 isn't there. So maybe the answer is 14, but that's not based on a precise calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be a simple ratio without considering fractions. So 8 people need 10 bottles. So per person, 10/8=1.25. But perhaps she can't buy a fraction of a bottle, so she rounds up. For 12 people, 12 *1.25=15. So she needs to buy 15, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct approach is to choose the next available option, which is E)14. But that's speculative.\n\nWait, another angle. Maybe the question is about the number of bottles per person. So 8 people had 10 bottles, which is 1.25 each. So for 12 people, 12 *1.25=15, but again, no option. So perhaps the answer is 14, as the closest higher number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is designed to have a trick, and the answer is 10, but that doesn't make sense because more people would need more bottles.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is D)12, because it's the number of people. So 12 people would need 12 bottles, but that doesn't fit the initial data. Because 8 people had 10 bottles, which is less than 8.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The problem says Jill needed to buy 10 bottles for 8 people. Now, for 12 people, how many bottles does she need? So the initial rate is 10 bottles per 8 people. So the rate is 10/8 = 1.25 bottles per person.\n\nSo for 12 people, 12 *1.25 =15 bottles. But that's not an option. So maybe the problem expects us to approximate or find a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be a unit rate problem. So, 10 bottles for 8 people. So per person, it's 1.25 bottles. So for 12 people, 15 bottles. But again, no option.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is E)14, as it's the closest higher number. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to note that the number of bottles is 10, regardless of the number of people. But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a different number based on the number of attendees.\n\nWait, another thought. Maybe the problem is about the number of guests, not including the host. So, if 8 people attended the first party, perhaps 7 guests plus the host. So 10 bottles for 8 people. Then, for 12 people, perhaps 11 guests plus the host, but that doesn't change much. But this line of thinking might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of bottles per person being the same as the first time. So, each person drinks 1.25 bottles. So for 12 people, 15. But no option.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the options again. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14.\n\nSo, 10 is the initial number, 8 is the original number of people. So perhaps the answer is 10, but that's only if the number of people doesn't affect the number of bottles. Which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that 10 bottles are needed for 8 people, implying that each person has one bottle, and two are left. So for 12 people, she would need 12 +2=14. So E)14.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. I think the intended answer might be E)14, but I'm not entirely confident.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a simple ratio problem. Let me set it up as a proportion.\n\nLet me write:\n\n8 people \u2192 10 bottles\n\n12 people \u2192 X bottles\n\nSo, 8/10 = 12/X \u2192 cross-multiplying: 8X = 120 \u2192 X=15.\n\nBut since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest option, which would be E)14.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a simple multiplication. 8 people:10 bottles. So per person, 10/8=1.25. 12 people would need 12 *1.25=15. But no option. So perhaps the answer is E)14, as the next higher number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is intended to have an answer of 12, which is D. Because 12 is the number of people, and maybe she buys one bottle per person. But in the first case, she bought 10 for 8, which is more than one per person.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure. But given the options, I think the intended answer is E)14. Because when you scale up from 8 to 12 people, you can calculate based on the same per-person rate, but since 15 isn't an option, 14 is the closest higher number. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 10, but that doesn't make sense with more people.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: Perhaps the number of bottles is directly proportional to the number of people, but with a base. So, 8 people \u219210 bottles. So, 10 -8=2. So, for each person, she adds 1.25 bottles. So, 12 people: 8 +4 more people. So 10 +4*1.25=10+5=15. Again, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps she buys 2 bottles for every person. So 8 people: 10 bottles \u2192 10/8=1.25, which is not 2. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved as a simple ratio, but the options don't have the correct number. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the number of bottles being 10, regardless of the number of people. But that can't be right because the number of people is changing.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to make a table.\n\nPeople | Bottles\n8      |10\n12     |?\n\nSo, 8\u219210. What's the relationship? 10 = (8 *1.25). So for 12, 12*1.25=15. But no option. So perhaps the intended answer is E)14.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that each person drinks 1 bottle, and she buys 2 extra. So for 8 people, 8+2=10. For 12 people, 12+2=14. So E)14.\n\nBut that's an assumption based on the initial data, but the problem doesn't state it explicitly.\n\nIn the absence of more information, perhaps the intended answer is E)14. So I'll go with that.\n\n\nTo determine how many bottles of soda Jill needs to buy for a party with 12 people, we start by analyzing the initial data: 8 people required 10 bottles of soda. This gives us a rate of soda consumption. \n\n### Step 1: Calculate the rate of soda consumption\nFor 8 people, 10 bottles were needed. The consumption rate per person is:\n\\[\n\\text{Rate} = \\frac{10 \\, \\text{bottles}}{8 \\, \\text{people}} = 1.25 \\, \\text{bottles per person}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Scale the rate to 12 people\nUsing the rate of 1.25 bottles per person, the total number of bottles needed for 12 people is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total bottles} = 12 \\times 1.25 = 15 \\, \\text{bottles}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the options\nThe options provided are:\n- A) 6\n- B) 8\n- C) 10\n- D) 12\n- E) 14\n\nSince 15 is not an option, we consider the closest higher number, which is 14. This suggests that the problem may be approximating or rounding down to the nearest available option.\n\n### Step 4: Verify alternative interpretations\nAnother possible interpretation is that Jill buys 2 extra bottles in addition to one bottle per person. For 8 people, this would mean:\n\\[\n8 \\, \\text{people} + 2 \\, \\text{extra bottles} = 10 \\, \\text{bottles}.\n\\]\nExtending this pattern, for 12 people:\n\\[\n12 \\, \\text{people} + 2 \\, \\text{extra bottles} = 14 \\, \\text{bottles}.\n\\]\n\nThis aligns with option E) 14.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the options and the reasoning above, the most reasonable answer is **E) 14**.\n\nAnswer: E",

From the question, I remember that when there were 8 people, she bought 10 bottles. Hmm, wait, that doesn't seem like a direct one-to-one ratio. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of attendees and the number of bottles. So 8 people needed 10 bottles. So perhaps each person would drink a certain number of bottles. Let me calculate the rate. If 8 people drank 10 bottles, then per person, that's 10 divided by 8. Let me do that: 10 \u00f7 8 is 1.25. So each person drinks 1.25 bottles on average. That makes sense because maybe some people have one, others have two, but overall, it averages to 1.25 per person.\n\nNow, if there are 12 people coming, I can multiply 12 by 1.25 to find out how many bottles are needed. Let's calculate that. 12 times 1.25. Hmm, 12 * 1 is 12, and 12 * 0.25 is 3, so adding them together gives 15. So 12 people would need 15 bottles? But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 15 as an option. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. Oh, wait, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpreted the initial problem. Let me read it again. Oh! It says Jill needed to buy 10 bottles for 8 people. So perhaps the number of bottles is based on the number of attendees, maybe each person gets one bottle, but perhaps with some extra. Wait, 8 people and 10 bottles\u2014so two extra. So maybe she bought two extra bottles, perhaps one per person plus some. Alternatively, maybe it's not a per-person basis but a ratio.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a simple proportion. Let me think of it as a ratio problem. So 8 people correspond to 10 bottles. So the ratio is 8:10, which can be simplified to 4:5. So for every 4 people, she buys 5 bottles. Now, if there are 12 people, how many bottles is that? Let's set up a proportion.\n\nSo 4 people : 5 bottles = 12 people : x bottles.\n\nSo 4/5 = 12/x.\n\nWait, no, wait. The proportion should be 8 people / 10 bottles = 12 people / x bottles.\n\nSo cross-multiplying, 8 * x = 10 * 12. So 8x = 120. Then x = 120 /8 =15. Again, same as before. But the options don't have 15. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the initial setup is wrong. Perhaps the number of bottles is not directly proportional to the number of people. Maybe there's another factor, like the length of the party or something. But the question doesn't give any other details, so I can't consider that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is looking for a different approach. Let me think again. Maybe for 8 people, 10 bottles were bought, so perhaps each person gets one bottle, and two extra. So, per person, 1 bottle, and then 2 extras. So for 12 people, 12 + 2 =14 bottles. Oh, wait, that would make sense. Because 8 people would need 8 + 2 =10. So for 12, 12 +2=14. So the answer would be E)14.\n\nBut wait, why would she buy two extra? Maybe because she doesn't want anyone to go without, so she buys a couple extra. That's a common practice. So if that's the case, then the calculation would be 12 +2 =14.\n\nSo the options are E)14. Let me see. So the initial data was 8 people:10 bottles. So 8+2=10. So 12+2=14. That seems to fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a fixed number of extra bottles, like 2, regardless of the number of guests.\n\nSo in that case, the answer is E)14.\n",
