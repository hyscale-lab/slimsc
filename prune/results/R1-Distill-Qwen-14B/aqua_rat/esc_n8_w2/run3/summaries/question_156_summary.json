      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about the sum of k consecutive integers being 51, and the least integer is -50. I need to find k from the given options.\n\nHmm, I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since these are consecutive integers, the common difference is 1. So the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.\n\nWait, right. So in this case, the sum S is 51. The first term a1 is given as -50. But I don't know the last term, which I'll call a_k. Oh, but I can express a_k in terms of k because they're consecutive integers. Since each term increases by 1, the last term would be a1 + (k-1)*1. So a_k = -50 + (k-1) = k - 51.\n\nSo substituting into the sum formula: 51 = (k/2) * (-50 + (k -51)). Let me compute that inside part. -50 + k -51 is k - 101. So the equation becomes 51 = (k/2) * (k - 101).\n\nWait, that's (k (k - 101)) / 2 = 51. So I can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator. That gives k(k -101) = 102.\n\nSo expanding that, it's k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0. Now, I have a quadratic equation. Let me write it as k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me double-check the earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So the sum formula: yes, S = n/2 (first + last). First term is -50, last term is -50 + (k-1) because each step increases by 1. So that's correct. So last term is -50 +k -1 = k -51.\n\nSo substituting into the sum: 51 = (k/2) * (k -51 -50) = (k/2)(k -101). So that's correct. So the quadratic is k\u00b2 -101k -102 =0.\n\nWait, but solving this quadratic might be a bit tricky. Let me think about using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is in the form of a k\u00b2 + b k + c =0. So a=1, b=-101, c=-102.\n\nThe quadratic formula is k = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a). Plugging in the values:\n\nb\u00b2 = (-101)^2 = 10201. 4ac = 4*1*(-102) = -408. So the discriminant is 10201 - (4 *1* (-102)) = 10201 + 408 = 10609. What's the square root of 10609? Hmm, 103 squared is 10609 because 100^2 is 10000, 103^2 is 10609 (since 103*103 = (100+3)^2 = 10000 +600 +9= 10609). So sqrt(10609)=103.\n\nSo the solutions are [101 \u00b1103]/(2). Let's compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, [101 +103]/2 = 204/2=102. Second, [101-103]/2 = (-2)/2= -1.\n\nSo k could be 102 or -1. But since k represents the number of terms, it can't be negative. So k=102 is a possible solution.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 102. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the setup because 102 seems a bit high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the sum of 102 consecutive integers starting at -50. Let's compute the sum to see if it's 51. The last term would be a1 + (k-1) = -50 +101=51. So the terms would be from -50 to 51 inclusive. The number of terms is 51 - (-50) +1 = 102. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The sum of all integers from -50 to 51. Let me think about the average times the number of terms. The average of the first and last term is (-50 +51)/2 = 0.5. So sum is 0.5 *102 =51. Yep, that's correct. So k=102.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, E is 102. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The quadratic gave me k=102 and k=-1. But in the options, 102 is present. So that's the correct choice. So the answer is E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think if there's another way to approach this problem. For example, the sum of consecutive integers can be calculated as the average multiplied by the number of terms. So the average is (first + last)/2. The first is -50, last is a_k = -50 + (k-1)*1 =k -51. So average is ( -50 + (k-51) ) /2 = (k -101)/2.\n\nSum is 51 = k * (k-101)/2. Which brings me back to the same equation. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me check the option. The choices are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102. So E is 102, which matches.\n\nBut why did the quadratic give me k=102 and k=-1? Well, because when I set up the equation, k is the number of terms, so it has to be positive. So -1 is invalid. So the only valid solution is 102.\n\nTherefore, the answer is E)102.\n",

Let me write that out.\n\n51 = k*(-50 + k -51)/2\nSimplify inside the parentheses: -50 -51 is -101, so it's (k - 101).

So the equation becomes:\n\n51 = k*(k - 101)/2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n102 = k*(k -101)\n\nExpanding the right side: k^2 -101k.\n\nSo now the equation is:\nk^2 - 101k - 102 = 0.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me check. Because when I move everything to one side, it's 102 - k^2 +101k =0. Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, I had 102 = k(k -101) \u2192 102 = k^2 -101k.\n\nBringing all terms to left: k^2 -101k -102 = 0. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation: k^2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nI can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is in the form a k^2 + b k + c =0, where a=1, b=-101, c=-102.\n\nThe quadratic formula is k = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nb\u00b2 = (-101)^2 = 10201\n4ac = 4*1*(-102) = -408\nSo the discriminant is 10201 - (-408) \u2192 Wait, wait, discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. So 10201 - (4*1*(-102)) \u2192 10201 +408 = 10609.\n\nWhat's the square root of 10609? Hmm, I think 103 squared is 10609 because 100^2 is 10,000 and 103^2 is (100+3)^2 = 10000 + 600 +9= 10609. Yes, so sqrt(10609)=103.\n\nSo, the solutions are [101 \u00b1103]/2.\n\nCalculating both possibilities:\n\nFirst solution: (101 +103)/2 = 204/2 = 102.\n\nSecond solution: (101 -103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nBut k can't be negative because it's the number of terms. So k must be 102.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 102. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check because sometimes when you set up the equation, you might have made a mistake. Let me retrace.\n\nSum = k*(a1 + ak)/2.\n\na1 is -50, ak is a1 + (k-1)*1 = -50 +k -1 = k -51.\n\nSo sum is k*(-50 + (k-51)) /2 = k*(k-101)/2.\n\nSet equal to 51: 51 = k(k-101)/2 \u2192 102 =k(k-101) \u2192 k\u00b2 -101k -102=0.\n\nYes, same equation. So solving gives k=102 or k=-1. Since k can't be negative, k=102.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. 102 terms, starting at -50. So the last term would be -50 +101=51.\n\nWait, the sum is 51, but if the numbers are from -50 to 51 inclusive, that's 102 numbers. The sum of numbers from -50 to 50 is zero, because each positive and negative cancels. Then adding 51: so sum is 51. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but wait, the sum from -50 to 51 is (51 - (-50) +1) terms. Wait, 51 - (-50) is 101, plus 1 is 102 terms. So the sum is (first + last) * n /2 = ( (-50) +51 ) *102/2 = (1)*51=51. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is E)102.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum of \\( k \\) consecutive integers is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\frac{k \\cdot (a_1 + a_k)}{2}\n\\]\n\nHere, the sum is 51, the first term \\( a_1 \\) is -50, and the last term \\( a_k \\) is \\( a_1 + (k-1) \\). Since the integers are consecutive, the common difference is 1, so:\n\n\\[\na_k = -50 + (k - 1) = k - 51\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into the sum formula:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k \\cdot (-50 + (k - 51))}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k \\cdot (k - 101)}{2}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n102 = k \\cdot (k - 101)\n\\]\n\nExpand and rearrange to form a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nk^2 - 101k - 102 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -101 \\), and \\( c = -102 \\). Calculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = (-101)^2 - 4(1)(-102) = 10201 + 408 = 10609\n\\]\n\nTake the square root of the discriminant:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{10609} = 103\n\\]\n\nSubstitute into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{101 \\pm 103}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives two solutions:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{101 + 103}{2} = 102 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad k = \\frac{101 - 103}{2} = -1\n\\]\n\nSince \\( k \\) represents the number of terms, it cannot be negative. Thus, \\( k = 102 \\).\n\nFinally, verify the result: The sequence starts at -50 and ends at 51, with 102 terms. The sum of numbers from -50 to 50 is zero, and adding 51 gives a total sum of 51, confirming the solution is correct.\n\nAnswer: E",
