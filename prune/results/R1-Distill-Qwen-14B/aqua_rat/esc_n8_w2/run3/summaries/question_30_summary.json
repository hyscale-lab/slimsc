      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about figuring out my brother's current age based on when I was younger.\n\nAlright, when I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. So that means when I was 2, he was 1 year old, right? Because half of 2 is 1. So, that gives me a starting point.\n\nWait, but how old am I now? Oh right, the question says I'm 60 years old now. So I need to find out how old my brother is today.\n\nHmm, so let's think about the age difference between us. When I was 2, my brother was 1. So the age difference between us is 1 year. Because I'm older than him by a year. That age gap doesn't change over time, right? Like, if I'm a year older then, I'm still a year older now.\n\nSo, if I'm 60 now, my brother should be 60 minus 1, which is 59. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when I was 2, he was 1. So the age difference is 1 year. So now, I'm 60, he's 60 minus 1? No, wait. Wait, no. Because if I'm older, then he's younger by that difference.\n\nLet me think again. When I was 2, he was 1. So the difference is 1 year. So my brother is always one year younger than me. So now, I'm 60, he should be 60 minus 1, which is 59. So that would be option A)59.\n\nWait, but let me check. So the age difference is 1 year. So when I was 2, he was 1. So now, I'm 60. He's 60 minus 1 = 59. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option A)59.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nWhen the speaker was 2 years old, their brother was half their age, meaning the brother was 1 year old at that time. This establishes an age difference of 1 year, with the speaker being older. Since the age difference remains constant over time, and the speaker is now 60 years old, the brother's current age is calculated as 60 - 1 = 59 years old.

The options are A)59, B)69, C)79, D)89, E)99. \n\nAlright, let me break this down. So, when I was 2, my brother was half my age. Half of 2 is 1, right? So at that time, I was 2 and my brother was 1. Wait, but wait\u2014that would mean my brother is one year younger than me. Because if I'm 2 and he's 1, the age difference is 1 year.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes age problems can be tricky with the wording.\n\nWait a second, let me think again. When I was 2, he was 1. So the age difference is 1 year. So when I was born, he wasn't born yet. He was born a year after me. So each year, the age difference remains the same. So now, when I'm 60, he's 60 minus 1, which is 59. So the answer should be A)59. But wait, looking at the options, option A is 59, which seems correct.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Did I get the age difference right? If when I was 2, he was 1, then yes, he's one year younger. So yes, the age difference is one year. So regardless of when we are now, the age difference stays the same. So if I'm 60, he's 59.\n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)59, B)69, C)79, D)89, E)99. So A is 59, which would be correct. So the correct answer should be A.\n\nWait, but why are the other options so much higher? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Maybe the way I'm interpreting the problem is wrong. Let me rephrase.\n\nThe problem says, when I was 2, my brother was half my age. So, my age then was 2, brother's age was 1. So the age difference is 1. So in the present, when I'm 60, brother is 60 -1=59. So yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should set up equations. Let's denote the current ages. Let my current age be M, brother's age be B. According to the problem, when I was 2, my brother was half my age. So, the time when I was 2 was (M - 2) years ago. At that time, my brother's age was B - (M -2) = half of my age at that time, which was 2. So B - (M-2) = 1.\n\nNow, since M is 60, substituting that in: B - (60-2) =1 \u2192 B -58=1 \u2192 B=59.
