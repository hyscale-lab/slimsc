      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I'm going to think through it step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back and Raj is 17 years old now, how old is Rahim now? The options are A)37, B)41, C)40, D)42, E)43.\n\nHmm, alright. So, I need to find Rahim's current age. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I know Raj's current age is 17. That's straightforward. Now, the problem refers to their ages 5 years ago. So I need to figure out what their ages were then and use that information to find out Rahim's current age.\n\nFive years ago, Raj was 17 minus 5, which is 12 years old. So, Raj was 12 five years ago. The problem states that at that time, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. So, Raj's age back then was one-third of Rahim's age back then.\n\nLet me represent this mathematically. Let me denote:\n\nLet R be Rahim's current age.\n\nFive years ago, Raj's age was 12, and that was equal to (1/3) of Rahim's age five years ago.\n\nSo, five years ago, Rahim's age would be R - 5.\n\nAccording to the problem, 12 equals (1/3) multiplied by (R -5). So the equation would be:\n\n12 = (1/3) * (R -5)\n\nTo solve for R, I can rearrange this equation.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n12 * 3 = R -5\n36 = R -5\n\nNow, add 5 to both sides to solve for R:\n\n36 + 5 = R\n41 = R\n\nSo, R is 41. That means Rahim is currently 41 years old.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 41. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFive years ago, Raj was 12. At that time, he was one-third as old as Rahim. So, if 12 is one-third of Rahim's age back then, then Rahim's age five years ago must have been 12 * 3 = 36. So, adding 5 years to that, because it's five years ago, 36 +5 =41. Yep, that matches. So the calculation seems correct.\n",

The options are A)37, B)41, C)40, D)42, E)43.\n\nHmm, let's think about what we know. First, I need to figure out how old Raj and Rahim were five years ago, and then find out their current ages based on that information.\n\nWait, Raj is 17 now. So five years back, he was 17 minus 5, which is 12 years old. Right, so five years ago, Raj was 12.\n\nThe problem states that at that time, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. So if Raj was 12, then that's one-third of Rahim's age at that time. \n\nLet me put that into an equation. Let me denote the age of Rahim five years ago as R. So, 12 equals (1/3) * R. To find R, I can rearrange that equation. Multiply both sides by 3: R = 12 * 3 = 36. So five years ago, Rahim was 36 years old.\n\nBut wait, that's five years ago. To find his current age, I need to add those five years to that. So 36 plus 5 equals 41. So Rahim is 41 years old now.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 41. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Five years ago, Raj was 12. If at that time, he was one-third of Rahim's age, then Rahim must have been 36. Now, five years later, 36 +5 is 41. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nAnother way to approach it: Let me denote variables. Let R be Raj's current age (which is 17), and let H be Rahim's current age. Five years ago, Raj's age was R -5, which is 12. At that time, his age was one-third of Rahim's age. So R-5 = (1/3)(H -5). Plugging in R=17, 17-5=12, so 12 = (H-5)/3. Multiply both sides by 3: 36 = H-5. So H=41. Yep, same result.\n",
