      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe question says: In an exam, a candidate secured 504 marks out of the maximum mark M. If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks. We need to find the value of M.\n\nHmm, so the candidate's score is 504 when the maximum is M. But if the maximum is changed to 800, his score becomes 420. So it's like a scaling problem. I think I need to find the original maximum mark M based on this scaling.\n\nWait, so the candidate's performance is being compared before and after the maximum mark changes. So the ratio of his score to the maximum should remain the same in both cases, right? Because his actual performance doesn't change; only the maximum possible marks are changing.\n\nLet me think about this. So the ratio of his marks to the maximum is the same in both scenarios. So, 504/M should equal 420/800.\n\nWait, but is that the case? Or maybe the value of his marks scales proportionally when the maximum changes. Oh, right, that's correct. Because the candidate's actual ability hasn't changed, so the proportion of the marks he obtained relative to the maximum should remain the same.\n\nSo setting up the equation: 504/M = 420/800.\n\nNow, I can solve for M. Let me cross-multiply. So, 504 * 800 = 420 * M.\n\nCalculating that: 504 * 800. Hmm, 504 * 800. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, 504 * 800 is the same as 504 * 8 * 100. 504 * 8 is 4032. So 4032 * 100 = 403200. So left side is 403200.\n\nRight side is 420 * M. So 420 * M = 403200.\n\nTo find M, divide both sides by 420. M = 403200 / 420.\n\nLet me compute that division. 403200 divided by 420.\n\nHmm, maybe I can simplify this. Let's see: 420 is 42 *10. So 403200 / (42 *10) = (403200 /42)/10.\n\nWhat's 403200 divided by 42? Let me think. 42 times 9000 is 378000. Because 42 * 9000 = (40*9000)+(2*9000)=360000 +18000=378000.\n\nSubtracting that from 403200: 403200 -378000 =25200.\n\nNow, 42 * 600 is 25200 (because 42*6=252, so 42*600=25200).\n\nSo 9000 + 600 = 9600. So 403200 /42 = 9600.\n\nSo M = 9600 /10 = 960.\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Option E is 960. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the setup. Because sometimes when scaling, it's possible that the percentage changes differently.\n\nAnother way to think: the candidate's score is scaled from M to 800. So if M is the original max, and it's converted to 800, then his original 504 becomes 420 in the new scale. So the scaling factor is 800/M.\n\nSo 504 * (800/M) =420.\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. So solving 504*(800/M)=420.\n\nWhich again gives 504 *800=420 M, leading to M= (504*800)/420= (504/420)*800.\n\nSimplify 504/420: both divisible by 84? Let's see: 504 \u00f7 84 is 6, 420 \u00f784 is 5. So 6/5.\n\nSo (6/5)*800 = (6*160)=960. Yep, same result.\n\nSo M is 960, which is option E.\n",

Now, if this maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, the candidate's score would be 420. I need to find the value of M.\n\nHmm, so let me break this down. It sounds like there's a scaling involved here. The candidate's score is being converted from a scale of M to 800, and their score changes from 504 to 420. So, I think this is about proportionate scaling.\n\nWait, scaling can be a bit tricky, but I remember that when you scale the maximum, the actual percentage or ratio of the score remains the same. So the candidate's performance should be consistent whether the maximum is M or 800.\n\nSo, the original scenario is that the candidate got 504 out of M. In the scaled scenario, it's 420 out of 800. Since the performance is the same, the ratio of their score to the maximum should be equal in both cases.\n\nMathematically, that would mean 504/M = 420/800. Oh, right, because if the maximum is scaled, the same performance would give the same ratio.\n\nSo I can set up the equation as 504 divided by M equals 420 divided by 800. Let me write that down:\n\n504 / M = 420 / 800\n\nNow, I need to solve for M. To do that, I can cross-multiply. So, multiply both sides by M and by 800 to get rid of the denominators.\n\nThat gives me 504 * 800 = 420 * M\n\nLet me calculate that. 504 multiplied by 800. Hmm, 504 * 800. Well, 504 * 8 is 4032, right? So 504 * 800 would be 403200. Because 800 is 8 * 100, so I add two zeros. So 403200.\n\nOn the other side, it's 420 * M. So, 420 times M equals 403200.\n\nTo find M, I divide both sides by 420. So,\n\nM = 403200 / 420\n\nLet me compute that. 403200 divided by 420.\n\nFirst, maybe simplify both numbers. Let's see, 420 is 42 * 10. 403200 divided by 420 is the same as (403200 \u00f7 10) divided by 42, which is 40320 \u00f7 42.\n\nWait, 40320 divided by 42. Let me calculate that.\n\n42 goes into 40320 how many times?\n\nWell, 42 * 900 is 37,800. Let's subtract that from 40320: 40320 - 37800 = 2520.\n\n42 goes into 2520 exactly 60 times (because 42*60=2520). So 900 +60= 960.\n\nSo M is 960.\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation because sometimes I make arithmetic errors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should factor both numbers. Let's see:\n\n403200 \u00f7 420.\n\nWe can divide numerator and denominator by 10 to get 40320 \u00f742.\n\n40320 \u00f742. Let me think: 42 times 900 is 37,800. Subtract that from 40320, you get 2520. 42 times 60 is 2520. So 900 +60=960.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo M is 960.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 960. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recheck the initial setup.\n\nThe candidate's original score is 504/M, and when M is scaled to 800, the score is 420/800. So 504/M = 420/800. Cross-multiplying gives 504*800=420*M. So yes, 403200 = 420 M. So M=403200/420=960. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can check by plugging back into the equation. If M is 960, then 504/960 should equal 420/800.\n\n504 divided by 960. Let's compute that. Let me see, 504 \u00f7 960. Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 48. 504 \u00f748 is 10.5, 960 \u00f748 is 20. So 10.5/20 = 0.525.\n\nNow, 420/800: 420 \u00f7800. 420/800 is 0.525 as well. So yes, the ratios are equal. So M=960 is correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is option E, 960.\n",
