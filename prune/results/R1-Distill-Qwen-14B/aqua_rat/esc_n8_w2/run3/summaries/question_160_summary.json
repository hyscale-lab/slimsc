      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decreased by 15%. I need to find the new selling price per article. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the situation. Before the price decrease, Anna was buying some number of articles for $300. After the price went down by 15%, she can buy 5 more articles with the same amount of money. So, the number of articles she can buy increased by 5 because each article is now cheaper.\n\nLet me denote the original price per article as P. So, originally, the number of articles she could buy is 300 divided by P, right? That's 300/P.\n\nAfter the price decreased by 15%, the new price is P minus 15% of P. Let me calculate that. 15% of P is 0.15*P, so the new price is P - 0.15P = 0.85P. So the new price per article is 0.85 times the original price.\n\nNow, with the same $300, how many articles can she buy now? That would be 300 divided by the new price, which is 300/(0.85P). According to the problem, this new quantity is 5 more than the original quantity. So, the equation would be:\n\n300/(0.85P) = (300/P) + 5.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when the price went down, the number of articles she can buy increases by 5.\n\nNow, I need to solve this equation for P, and then find the new price, which is 0.85P.\n\nLet me rewrite the equation:\n\n300/(0.85P) = 300/P + 5.\n\nHmm, maybe I can simplify this. Let's let x = 300/P. Then the equation becomes:\n\n300/(0.85P) = x +5.\n\nBut wait, 300/(0.85P) can also be written as (300/P) * (1/0.85) ) = x * (1/0.85) = x / 0.85.\n\nSo substituting, we get x/0.85 = x +5.\n\nHmm, so that's x/0.85 = x +5.\n\nLet me solve for x.\n\nMultiply both sides by 0.85 to eliminate the denominator:\n\nx = 0.85*(x +5).\n\nExpanding the right side: x = 0.85x + 0.85*5.\n\n0.85*5 is 4.25. So x = 0.85x +4.25.\n\nSubtract 0.85x from both sides: x - 0.85x =4.25.\n\n0.15x =4.25.\n\nSo x =4.25 /0.15.\n\nCalculating that: 4.25 divided by 0.15. Let's see, 0.15 times 28 is 4.20, and 0.15*28.333... is 4.25. So 4.25/0.15 is approximately 28.333... So x is 28.333... Or exactly, 28 and 1/3, because 0.333 is 1/3.\n\nWait, but x was defined as 300/P. So x = 300/P = 28.3333... So, solving for P: P =300 / x = 300 / (28.3333...).\n\nLet me compute that. 28.3333 is 85/3, because 85/3 is 28.333... So 300 divided by (85/3) is 300 * (3/85) = (900)/85.\n\nSimplify 900/85: 85*10=850, 85*10=850, 85*10.588... 900-850=50, so 10 and 50/85. 50/85 reduces to 10/17. So 10 and 10/17, which is approximately 10.588.\n\nWait, so P is approximately $10.588. But wait, that's the original price. The new price is 0.85P, so let me calculate that.\n\n0.85 * 10.588 \u2248 9.054. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see that. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach the problem differently. Let's think about the number of articles before and after.\n\nLet me denote the original number of articles as N. So N = 300 / P.\n\nAfter the price decrease, the number becomes N +5 = 300/(0.85P).\n\nSo substituting N =300/P into the second equation: (300/P) +5 = 300/(0.85P).\n\nWait, that's the same equation as before. So perhaps I should try to solve it algebraically.\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\n300/(0.85P) = 300/P +5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 0.85P to eliminate denominators.\n\n300 = 0.85P*(300/P) +5*0.85P.\n\nSimplify: 300 = 0.85*300 +4.25P.\n\n0.85 *300 is 255. So 300 = 255 +4.25P.\n\nSubtract 255 from both sides: 300-255 =4.25P.\n\n45 =4.25P.\n\nSo P =45 /4.25.\n\nWhat's 4.25? It's 17/4. So 45/(17/4) =45*(4/17) = (180)/17 \u224810.588. So P is about $10.59.\n\nSo the original price was around $10.59, and the new price is 0.85 times that. Let me compute 0.85 *10.588.\n\n0.85 *10 =8.5, 0.85 *0.588\u22480.500. So total around 9.00. So new price is approx $9. But wait, the options don't have 9. Hmm, so maybe I messed up somewhere.\n\nWait, let me recheck the calculations.\n\nWait, when I had x =4.25 /0.15, which is 28.333..., which is 85/3. So x is 85/3. Then P is 300/(85/3) = (300*3)/85 =900/85. Let me compute 900 \u00f785.\n\n85 *10=850 \u2192 900-850=50. So 10 with 50 left. 85*0.5882\u224850. So 10.5882, as before. So original P is about 10.588, new price is 0.85 *10.588=9.054.\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA) $8\n\nB) $10\n\nC) $13.6\n\nD) $22.9\n\nE) $40\n\nHmm, none of these are near 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the equation again.\n\nThe original number of articles is N=300/P.\n\nAfter the price decrease, number is N+5=300/(0.85P).\n\nSo, 300/(0.85P) = N+5 = (300/P) +5.\n\nAlternatively, let's let N =300/P.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n300/(0.85P) = N +5.\n\nBut since N=300/P, then substituting:\n\n300/(0.85P) = 300/P +5.\n\nBut perhaps another approach would be better. Let me think in terms of ratios.\n\nThe new price is 85% of the old price, so the quantity she can buy increases by 1/(0.85) times. Wait, because if the price is 85%, the number you can buy with the same money is inversely proportional.\n\nWait, the number of articles is inversely proportional to price. So if price decreases by 15%, it's 85% of the original. So the quantity increases by 1/0.85 \u22481.176, which is about 17.6% increase.\n\nBut the problem says the quantity increases by 5 articles. So the increase is 5 articles, which is 17.6% of the original quantity. So 5 = 0.176 * N, so N=5/0.176 \u224828.4615.\n\nSo N\u224828.4615, which is the original number of articles. So original price P=300/N\u2248300/28.4615\u224810.538.\n\nHmm, that's close to what I had before, around 10.54. Then the new price is 0.85 *10.538\u22489.013.\n\nWait, but that's still not matching any options. Maybe I'm missing something in the problem setup.\n\nWait, the problem says she can buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decreased. So perhaps it's the number of articles she can buy now is 5 more than before.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the problem as:\n\nLet P be the original price per article.\n\nOriginal number of articles: 300/P.\n\nAfter price decrease, new price is 0.85P.\n\nNumber of articles now: 300/(0.85P).\n\nSo, 300/(0.85P) = (300/P) +5.\n\nYes, that's the equation I set up earlier.\n\nLet me solve this equation again.\n\n300/(0.85P) = 300/P +5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 0.85P:\n\n300 = 0.85P*(300/P) +5 *0.85P.\n\nSimplify:\n\n300 = 0.85 *300 +4.25P.\n\n0.85 *300 is 255.\n\nSo 300 =255 +4.25P.\n\nSubtract 255: 45 =4.25P.\n\nSo P =45 /4.25 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 4.25 is 17/4, so 45 \u00f7 (17/4) =45*(4/17)=180/17 \u224810.588.\n\nSo original price P is approximately $10.59, new price is 0.85 *10.59\u22489.05.\n\nBut none of the options match. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute 45 divided by 4.25.\n\n4.25 goes into 45 how many times? 4.25 *10=42.5. 45-42.5=2.5. 4.25 goes into 2.5 about 0.588 times (since 4.25 *0.588\u22482.5). So 10.588.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.\n\n4.25 * x =45.\n\nx=45 /4.25.\n\nWell, 4.25 * 10 =42.5. 45-42.5=2.5 left.\n\n2.5 /4.25 = (2.5 *100)/(4.25*100) )= 250/425 = divide numerator and denominator by 25: 10/17\u22480.5882.\n\nSo x=10.5882, which is 10 and 10/17.\n\nSo P is 10 and 10/17 dollars, which is approximately 10.588.\n\nSo new price is 0.85 * P= 0.85 * (180/17)= (0.85 *180)/17.\n\nWait, 0.85 is 17/20. So (17/20)*180 = (17*180)/20 = (17*9) =153. So 153 divided by 17 is 9. So new price is 9 dollars. But wait, 9 isn't one of the options.\n\nWait, let me recheck. Oh wait, 0.85 *180/17.\n\nWait, 180/17 is approximately 10.588. 0.85 times that is 9. So new price is 9, which isn't an option. So perhaps I did something wrong.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe I set up the equation incorrectly.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me let the new price be x. Then the original price was x /0.85, because new price is 85% of original.\n\nThe number of articles she can buy now is 300/x.\n\nThe number she could buy before is 300/(x/0.85) = 300 *0.85 /x = 255/x.\n\nAccording to the problem, 300/x = 255/x +5.\n\nSo 300/x = (255 +5x)/x.\n\nMultiply both sides by x: 300 =255 +5x.\n\nSubtract 255: 45 =5x \u2192 x=9.\n\nSo the new price is $9. But that's not an option. The options are A)8, B)10, C)13.6, D)22.9, E)40.\n\nHmm, so either I'm making a mistake, or perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Wait, let me check the equation again.\n\nWait, when the new price is x, the original price is x /0.85. So the number of articles she could buy before was 300 / (x/0.85) = 300 *0.85 /x =255/x.\n\nAfter the price decrease, she can buy 300/x articles, which is 5 more than before.\n\nSo 300/x =255/x +5.\n\nMultiply both sides by x: 300=255+5x \u219245=5x \u2192x=9.\n\nSo according to this, the new price is $9, but that's not an option. Hmm, so where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the price decreased by 15%, so new price is 85% of original.\n\nLet me call the original price P. So new price is 0.85P.\n\nNumber of articles before: 300/P.\n\nAfter: 300/(0.85P) = (300/P) +5.\n\nSo 300/(0.85P) = (300 +5P)/P.\n\nMultiply both sides by 0.85P:\n\n300 =0.85*(300 +5P).\n\nExpand: 300= 255 +4.25P.\n\nSubtract 255:45=4.25P \u2192 P=45/4.25=10.588.\n\nNew price is 0.85 *10.588\u22489.05.\n\nSo same result, new price is ~9.\n\nBut in the options, 9 is not present. So perhaps I need to re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decreased by 15%. So perhaps the initial amount she could buy was N, and now she can buy N+5.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as:\n\nLet the original price be P. So number of articles she can buy is N=300/P.\n\nAfter price decrease by 15%, new price is 0.85P. So new number is N' =300/(0.85P).\n\nAccording to the problem, N' =N +5.\n\nSo 300/(0.85P) =300/P +5.\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. So solving gives P=45/4.25=10.588, new price is 9.05.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the options again. Wait, option C is 13.6. That's higher than the original price. That doesn't make sense because the price decreased.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the percentage. Wait, if the price decreased by 15%, the new price is 85% of the original. So perhaps I should have the original price be P, new price is 0.85P.\n\nWait, but according to my calculations, the new price is $9, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's denote the new price as x. Then the original price was x/(0.85).\n\nWait, no, that's correct. So number of articles before was 300/(x/0.85)=255/x.\n\nAfter, she can buy 300/x.\n\nSo 300/x =255/x +5 \u2192 300=255 +5x \u2192x=9.\n\nSo the new price is $9, but that's not an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the price decreased by 15% of the new price, not 15% of the original. But that would complicate things. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem states the price of each article decreased by 15%. That usually means 15% of the original price. So the new price is 85% of the original.\n\nSo I think my approach is correct, but the answer isn't among the options. That can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should set it up as the original price being P, and new price being P-0.15P=0.85P.\n\nSo, number of articles before: 300/P.\n\nNumber after:300/(0.85P).\n\nSo, 300/(0.85P) =300/P +5.\n\nWhich leads to the same equation. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try plugging the options into the equation to see if any fit.\n\nLet me try option B) $10.\n\nIf new price is $10, then original price was 10/0.85\u224811.7647.\n\nNumber of articles before:300/11.7647\u224825.5.\n\nAfter, 300/10=30. So 30-25.5=4.5. Not 5. So not matching.\n\nOption C)13.6.\n\nIf new price is 13.6, original price was 13.6/0.85=16.\n\nNumber before:300/16=18.75.\n\nAfter:300/13.6\u224822.05.\n\n22.05-18.75\u22483.3, not 5.\n\nOption E)40.\n\nNew price 40, original price 40/0.85\u224847.0588.\n\nNumber before:300/47.0588\u22486.364.\n\nAfter:300/40=7.5. 7.5-6.364\u22481.136. Not 5.\n\nOption A)8.\n\nNew price 8, original price 8/0.85\u22489.4118.\n\nNumber before:300/9.4118\u224831.87.\n\nAfter:300/8=37.5.\n\n37.5-31.87\u22485.63. Close to 5, but not exact.\n\nOption D)22.9.\n\nNew price 22.9, original price 22.9/0.85\u224827. (Wait, 0.85 *27=22.95, so 27 *0.85 is 22.95. Close to 22.9. So original price approx 27.)\n\nNumber before:300/27\u224811.111.\n\nAfter:300/22.9\u224813.09.\n\n13.09-11.111\u22481.98. Not 5.\n\nHmm, none of the options give a difference of 5 when using the new price. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me consider that the price decreased by $15, not 15%. Oh wait, but the question says the price decreased by 15%. So that's a percentage decrease, not a fixed amount. So perhaps I'm right in using 0.85P.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when I solved for x, I got 45=5x \u2192x=9, but that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is that the new price is 13.6, which is option C. Let's see.\n\nWait, if new price is 13.6, then original price is 13.6 /0.85=16.\n\nNumber before:300/16=18.75.\n\nNumber after:300/13.6\u224822.05.\n\nSo 22.05-18.75=3.3. Not 5.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me let the new price be x. So the original price is x /0.85.\n\nNumber of articles she could buy before:300/(x/0.85)=255/x.\n\nAfter the decrease, she buys 300/x articles. The difference is 5.\n\nSo 300/x -255/x =5 \u2192 (45)/x=5 \u2192x=45/5=9.\n\nSo new price is 9, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the original price, but no, the question asks for the new price.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?\"\n\nSo, after the decrease, she can buy 5 more articles for the same money. So the number of articles she can buy increases by 5. So my setup was correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. So maybe I should check my calculations again.\n\nWait, let me compute P when x=9. Original P=10.588, new price 9. So let's compute the number of articles before and after.\n\nBefore:300/10.588\u224828.333.\n\nAfter:300/9=33.333.\n\n33.333 -28.333=5. So that's correct. So the new price is 9, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are in whole dollars, and 9 isn't present. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe I should compute the new price as P*(1-0.15)=0.85P. Let me try to compute with the options.\n\nLet me take option C)13.6.\n\nIf new price is 13.6, then original price is 13.6/0.85=16.\n\nNumber before:300/16=18.75.\n\nNumber after:300/13.6\u224822.05.\n\nDifference is about 3.3, which isn't 5.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation should be:\n\nAfter the price decrease, the number of articles she can buy is 5 more than before.\n\nSo, 300/(0.85P) = (300/P) +5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 45/4.25.\n\n4.25 times 10 is 42.5. 45-42.5=2.5.\n\nSo 2.5 /4.25 = (2.5 *100)/(425) )=250/425=50/85=10/17\u22480.588.\n\nSo P=10.588, new price is 0.85 *10.588=9.05.\n\nHmm, but none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to let the new price be x, and then original price is x/0.85.\n\nSo, original number of articles: 300/(x/0.85) = (300*0.85)/x =255/x.\n\nAfter, number is 300/x.\n\nSo 300/x -255/x=5 \u219245/x=5 \u2192x=9.\n\nSo new price is 9, but it's not an option. So perhaps the problem is in the options, but that's not likely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I considered 5 more articles, but perhaps it's 5 more than the original, leading to a different setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the original number was N, and now it's N+5.\n\nSo, N=300/P.\n\nN+5=300/(0.85P).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n300/(0.85P) =300/P +5.\n\nWhich is the same equation as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should try to compute the new price from the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is $13.6, which is option C.\n\nLet me try with x=13.6.\n\nOriginal price P=13.6/0.85=16.\n\nNumber before:300/16=18.75.\n\nNumber after:300/13.6\u224822.05.\n\nDifference is 3.3, which isn't 5. So that's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me compute the number of articles before and after for each option and see which gives a difference of 5.\n\nOption A) $8.\n\nNew price x=8.\n\nOriginal price P=8/0.85\u22489.4118.\n\nNumber before:300/9.4118\u224831.87.\n\nNumber after:300/8=37.5.\n\nDifference:37.5-31.87\u22485.63. Close but not exactly 5.\n\nOption B) $10.\n\nx=10.\n\nP=10/0.85\u224811.7647.\n\nNumber before:300/11.7647\u224825.5.\n\nAfter:300/10=30.\n\nDifference:4.5. Close to 5.\n\nOption C)13.6.\n\nAs before, difference 3.3.\n\nOption E)40.\n\nx=40.\n\nP=40/0.85\u224847.0588.\n\nNumber before:300/47.0588\u22486.364.\n\nAfter:300/40=7.5.\n\nDifference:1.136.\n\nSo, the closest difference is option A)8, which gives a difference of ~5.63, and option B)10 gives 4.5.\n\nBut the problem states exactly 5 more. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the price decreased by 15%, so the new price is 85% of the original, but perhaps I should have considered the new price as P-0.15, not P*0.85. Wait, that's a big mistake! Because if the price is P, and it decreases by 15 units, that's a different scenario. But the question says the price decreased by 15%, which is a percentage, so it's 15% of the original price. So the new price is P -0.15P=0.85P.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem says the price decreased by 15, not 15%. Then the new price would be P-15. But that's not what the question says.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since none of the options give exactly 5, but option B)10 gives a difference of 4.5, which is close to 5, maybe the correct answer is B)10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me try with option B)10.\n\nx=10.\n\nOriginal price P=10/0.85\u224811.7647.\n\nNumber before:300/11.7647\u224825.5.\n\nAfter:300/10=30.\n\n30-25.5=4.5. Close to 5.\n\nSo perhaps the intended answer is B)10.\n\nBut according to my earlier calculation, the correct new price is $9, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is B)10.\n\nBut why does the calculation give 9? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the equation.\n\n300/(0.85P) = (300/P) +5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 0.85P: 300 = 0.85 *300 +5 *0.85 P \u2192300=255+4.25P \u219245=4.25P \u2192 P=45/4.25=10.588.\n\nNew price is 0.85 *10.588\u22489.05.\n\nSo the correct new price is $9.05, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are rounded. So $9.05 is closest to $10, but that's a big jump. Alternatively, perhaps the options are wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct equation is:\n\nNumber after = Number before +5.\n\nSo, 300/(0.85P) = (300/P) +5.\n\nWhich leads to P=10.588, new price 9.05.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the price decreased by 15, not 15%. But that would be a fixed decrease, not a percentage. Let me try that.\n\nIf the price decreased by $15, new price is P-15.\n\nNumber before:300/P.\n\nNumber after:300/(P-15).\n\nAccording to problem:300/(P-15)=300/P +5.\n\nMultiply both sides by P(P-15):\n\n300P =300(P-15) +5P(P-15).\n\nExpand:300P =300P -4500 +5P\u00b2-75P.\n\nSimplify:0= -4500 +5P\u00b2-75P.\n\nRearranged:5P\u00b2-75P -4500=0.\n\nDivide by 5: P\u00b2-15P -900=0.\n\nSolve using quadratic formula: P=[15 \u00b1\u221a(225 +3600)]/2 \u2192 [15 \u00b1\u221a3825]/2.\n\n\u221a3825\u224861.85.\n\nSo P=(15+61.85)/2\u224876.85/2\u224838.425. So P\u224838.43.\n\nNew price is P-15\u224823.43. Which is close to option D)22.9, but not exact. So that's probably not the intended approach.\n\nBut the problem states a 15% decrease, not a $15 decrease. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, after all this, I think the correct answer should be $9, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is B)10, which gives a difference close to 5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try one more approach.\n\nLet me assume the new price is 13.6 (option C). Then original price is 13.6/0.85=16.\n\nNumber before:300/16=18.75.\n\nNumber after:300/13.6\u224822.05.\n\nDifference:22.05-18.75=3.3.\n\nHmm, not 5.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the price decreased by 15%, so new price is P*0.85. Let me try with option C)13.6.\n\nIf new price is 13.6, then P=13.6/0.85=16.\n\nNumber before:300/16=18.75.\n\nNumber after:300/13.6\u224822.05.\n\nDifference:3.3.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Based on my calculations, the new price should be $9, but it's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is B)10, which gives a difference of 4.5, which is close to 5. Or maybe the options are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-express the equation.\n\nWait, let me write the equation again:\n\n300/(0.85P) =300/P +5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 0.85P:\n\n300 =0.85*300 +5 *0.85 P \u2192300=255+4.25P \u219245=4.25 P \u2192 P=45/4.25=10.588.\n\nSo new price is 0.85*10.588\u22489.05.\n\nBut since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is B)10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the price decreased by 15%, leading to the new price being 85% of the original. So, new price x=0.85 P \u2192P=x/0.85.\n\nNumber before:300/(x/0.85)=255/x.\n\nNumber after:300/x.\n\nSo, 300/x =255/x +5 \u219245/x=5 \u2192x=9.\n\nSo, the new price is 9, which is not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I should select the closest option, which is B)10.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C)13.6, but I can't see how.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute the difference in number of articles for each option and see which gives a difference of 5.\n\nOption A)8.\n\nOriginal price:8/0.85\u22489.4118.\n\nNumber before:300/9.4118\u224831.87.\n\nNumber after:300/8=37.5.\n\nDifference:5.63.\n\nOption B)10.\n\nOriginal price:10/0.85\u224811.7647.\n\nNumber before:300/11.7647\u224825.5.\n\nNumber after:300/10=30.\n\nDifference:4.5.\n\nOption C)13.6.\n\nOriginal price:13.6/0.85=16.\n\nNumber before:300/16=18.75.\n\nNumber after:300/13.6\u224822.05.\n\nDifference:3.3.\n\nOption D)22.9.\n\nOriginal price:22.9/0.85\u224827. (0.85*27=22.95, so 27 approx.)\n\nNumber before:300/27\u224811.111.\n\nNumber after:300/22.9\u224813.09.\n\nDifference:1.98.\n\nOption E)40.\n\nOriginal price:40/0.85\u224847.0588.\n\nNumber before:300/47.0588\u22486.364.\n\nNumber after:300/40=7.5.\n\nDifference:1.136.\n\nSo, the only option that gives a difference close to 5 is option A)8, which gives a difference of ~5.63. So perhaps the intended answer is A)8.\n\nBut earlier calculations suggest the correct answer is $9, which isn't present. So perhaps the intended answer is A)8.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Another thought: Perhaps the problem says the price decreased by 15%, so the new price is P*0.85, but perhaps I should model the number of articles after as N+5, where N is the original number.\n\nWait, but that's what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that I should have the new number being N+5, which leads to the same equation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the price is 85% of the original, so the number of articles is 1/0.85 times the original.\n\nSo, the increase in number is (1/0.85 -1) *N = (0.17647) *N =5.\n\nSo N=5/0.17647\u224828.333.\n\nSo N=300/P=28.333 \u2192P=300/28.333\u224810.588.\n\nNew price is 0.85*10.588\u22489.05.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nI'm stuck. Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is B)10, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A)8, but the calculations don't align.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the original price is P, new price is P-0.15P=0.85P.\n\nNumber before:300/P.\n\nNumber after:300/(0.85P) = (300/P) * (1/0.85) )= (300/P) *1.17647.\n\nSo, the increase is 17.647% of the original number.\n\nSo, 0.17647*(300/P)=5 \u2192300/(P)=5/0.17647\u224828.333.\n\nSo, P=300/28.333\u224810.588.\n\nNew price is 0.85*10.588\u22489.05.\n\nSo again, same result.\n\nI think I've tried all possible approaches, but the correct answer isn't among the options. So perhaps the intended answer is B)10, which gives a difference of 4.5, which is close to 5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are incorrect, and the correct answer is not listed.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decreased by 15%. I need to find the new selling price per article. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the situation. Before the price decrease, Anna was buying some number of articles for $300. After the price went down by 15%, she can buy 5 more articles with the same amount of money. So, the number of articles she can buy increased by 5 because each article is now cheaper.\n\nLet me denote the original price per article as P. So, originally, the number of articles she could buy is 300 divided by P, right? That's 300/P.\n\nAfter the price decreased by 15%, the new price is P minus 15% of P. Let me calculate that. 15% of P is 0.15*P, so the new price is P - 0.15P = 0.85P. So the new price per article is 0.85 times the original price.\n\nNow, with the same $300, how many articles can she buy now? That would be 300 divided by the new price, which is 300/(0.85P). According to the problem, this new quantity is 5 more than the original quantity. So, the equation would be:\n\n300/(0.85P) = (300/P) + 5.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when the price went down, the number of articles she can buy increases by 5.\n\nNow, I need to solve this equation for P, and then find the new price, which is 0.85P.\n\nLet me rewrite the equation:\n\n300/(0.85P) = 300/P + 5.\n\nHmm, maybe I can simplify this. Let's let x = 300/P. Then the equation becomes:\n\n300/(0.85P) = x +5.\n\nBut wait, 300/(0.85P) can also be written as (300/P) * (1/0.85) ) = x * (1/0.85) = x / 0.85.\n\nSo substituting, we get x/0.85 = x +5.\n\nHmm, so that's x/0.85 = x +5.\n\nLet me solve for x.\n\nMultiply both sides by 0.85 to eliminate the denominator:\n\nx = 0.85*(x +5).\n\nExpanding the right side: x = 0.85x + 0.85*5.\n\n0.85*5 is 4.25. So x = 0.85x +4.25.\n\nSubtract 0.85x from both sides: x - 0.85x =4.25.\n\n0.15x =4.25.\n\nSo x =4.25 /0.15.\n\nCalculating that: 4.25 divided by 0.15. Let's see, 0.15 times 28 is 4.20, and 0.15*28.333... is 4.25. So 4.25/0.15 is approximately 28.333... So x is 28.333... Or exactly, 28 and 1/3, because 0.333 is 1/3.\n\nWait, but x was defined as 300/P. So x = 300/P = 28.3333... So, solving for P: P =300 / x = 300 / (28.3333...).\n\nLet me compute that. 28.3333 is 85/3, because 85/3 is 28.333... So 300 divided by (85/3) is 300 * (3/85) = (900)/85.\n\nSimplify 900/85: 85*10=850, 85*10=850, 85*10.588... 900-850=50, so 10 and 50/85. 50/85 reduces to 10/17. So 10 and 10/17, which is approximately 10.588.\n\nWait, so P is approximately $10.588. But wait, that's the original price. The new price is 0.85P, so let me calculate that.\n\n0.85 * 10.588 \u2248 9.054. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see that. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach the problem differently. Let's think about the number of articles before and after.\n\nLet me denote the original number of articles as N. So N = 300 / P.\n\nAfter the price decrease, the number becomes N +5 = 300/(0.85P).\n\nSo substituting N =300/P into the second equation: (300/P) +5 = 300/(0.85P).\n\nWait, that's the same equation as before. So perhaps I should try to solve it algebraically.\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\n300/(0.85P) = 300/P +5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 0.85P to eliminate denominators.\n\n300 = 0.85P*(300/P) +5*0.85P.\n\nSimplify: 300 = 0.85*300 +4.25P.\n\n0.85 *300 is 255. So 300 = 255 +4.25P.\n\nSubtract 255 from both sides: 300-255 =4.25P.\n\n45 =4.25P.\n\nSo P =45 /4.25.\n\nWhat's 4.25? It's 17/4. So 45/(17/4) =45*(4/17) = (180)/17 \u224810.588. So P is about $10.59.\n\nSo the original price was around $10.59, and the new price is 0.85 times that. Let me compute 0.85 *10.588.\n\n0.85 *10 =8.5, 0.85 *0.588\u22480.500. So total around 9.00. So new price is approx $9. But wait, the options don't have 9. Hmm, so maybe I messed up somewhere.\n\nWait, let me recheck the calculations.\n\nWait, when I had x =4.25 /0.15, which is 28.333..., which is 85/3. So x is 85/3. Then P is 300/(85/3) = (300*3)/85 =900/85. Let me compute 900 \u00f785.\n\n85 *10=850 \u2192 900-850=50. So 10 with 50 left. 85*0.5882\u224850. So 10.5882, as before. So original P is about 10.588, new price is 0.85 *10.588=9.054.\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA) $8\n\nB) $10\n\nC) $13.6\n\nD) $22.9\n\nE) $40\n\nHmm, none of these are near 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the equation again.\n\nThe original number of articles is N=300/P.\n\nAfter the price decrease, number is N+5=300/(0.85P).\n\nSo, 300/(0.85P) = N+5 = (300/P) +5.\n\nAlternatively, let's let N =300/P.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n300/(0.85P) = N +5.\n\nBut since N=300/P, then substituting:\n\n300/(0.85P) = 300/P +5.\n\nBut perhaps another approach would be better. Let me think in terms of ratios.\n\nThe new price is 85% of the old price, so the quantity she can buy increases by 1/(0.85) times. Wait, because if the price is 85%, the number you can buy with the same money is inversely proportional.\n\nWait, the number of articles is inversely proportional to price. So if price decreases by 15%, it's 85% of the original. So the quantity increases by 1/0.85 \u22481.176, which is about 17.6% increase.\n\nBut the problem says the quantity increases by 5 articles. So the increase is 5 articles, which is 17.6% of the original quantity. So 5 = 0.176 * N, so N=5/0.176 \u224828.4615.\n\nSo N\u224828.4615, which is the original number of articles. So original price P=300/N\u2248300/28.4615\u224810.538.\n\nHmm, that's close to what I had before, around 10.54. Then the new price is 0.85 *10.538\u22489.013.\n\nWait, but that's still not matching any options. Maybe I'm missing something in the problem setup.\n\nWait, the problem says she can buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decreased. So perhaps it's the number of articles she can buy now is 5 more than before.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the problem as:\n\nLet P be the original price per article.\n\nOriginal number of articles: 300/P.\n\nAfter price decrease, new price is 0.85P.\n\nNumber of articles now: 300/(0.85P).\n\nSo, 300/(0.85P) = (300/P) +5.\n\nYes, that's the equation I set up earlier.\n\nLet me solve this equation again.\n\n300/(0.85P) = 300/P +5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 0.85P:\n\n300 = 0.85P*(300/P) +5 *0.85P.\n\nSimplify:\n\n300 = 0.85 *300 +4.25P.\n\n0.85 *300 is 255.\n\nSo 300 =255 +4.25P.\n\nSubtract 255: 45 =4.25P.\n\nSo P =45 /4.25 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 4.25 is 17/4, so 45 \u00f7 (17/4) =45*(4/17)=180/17 \u224810.588.\n\nSo original price P is approximately $10.59, new price is 0.85 *10.59\u22489.05.\n\nBut none of the options match. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute 45 divided by 4.25.\n\n4.25 goes into 45 how many times? 4.25 *10=42.5. 45-42.5=2.5. 4.25 goes into 2.5 about 0.588 times (since 4.25 *0.588\u22482.5). So 10.588.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.\n\n4.25 * x =45.\n\nx=45 /4.25.\n\nWell, 4.25 * 10 =42.5. 45-42.5=2.5 left.\n\n2.5 /4.25 = (2.5 *100)/(4.25*100) )= 250/425 = divide numerator and denominator by 25: 10/17\u22480.5882.\n\nSo x=10.5882, which is 10 and 10/17.\n\nSo P is 10 and 10/17 dollars, which is approximately 10.588.\n\nSo new price is 0.85 * P= 0.85 * (180/17)= (0.85 *180)/17.\n\nWait, 0.85 is 17/20. So (17/20)*180 = (17*180)/20 = (17*9) =153. So 153 divided by 17 is 9. So new price is 9 dollars. But wait, 9 isn't one of the options.\n\nWait, let me recheck. Oh wait, 0.85 *180/17.\n\nWait, 180/17 is approximately 10.588. 0.85 times that is 9. So new price is 9, which isn't an option. So perhaps I did something wrong.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe I set up the equation incorrectly.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me let the new price be x. Then the original price was x /0.85, because new price is 85% of original.\n\nThe number of articles she can buy now is 300/x.\n\nThe number she could buy before is 300/(x/0.85) = 300 *0.85 /x = 255/x.\n\nAccording to the problem, 300/x = 255/x +5.\n\nSo 300/x = (255 +5x)/x.\n\nMultiply both sides by x: 300 =255 +5x.\n\nSubtract 255: 45 =5x \u2192 x=9.\n\nSo the new price is $9. But that's not an option. The options are A)8, B)10, C)13.6, D)22.9, E)40.\n\nHmm, so either I'm making a mistake, or perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Wait, let me check the equation again.\n\nWait, when the new price is x, the original price is x /0.85. So the number of articles she could buy before was 300 / (x/0.85) = 300 *0.85 /x =255/x.\n\nAfter the price decrease, she can buy 300/x articles, which is 5 more than before.\n\nSo 300/x =255/x +5.\n\nMultiply both sides by x: 300=255+5x \u219245=5x \u2192x=9.\n\nSo according to this, the new price is $9, but that's not an option. Hmm, so where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the price decreased by 15%, so new price is 85% of original.\n\nLet me call the original price P. So new price is 0.85P.\n\nNumber of articles before: 300/P.\n\nAfter: 300/(0.85P) = (300/P) +5.\n\nSo 300/(0.85P) = (300 +5P)/P.\n\nMultiply both sides by 0.85P:\n\n300 =0.85*(300 +5P).\n\nExpand: 300= 255 +4.25P.\n\nSubtract 255:45=4.25P \u2192 P=45/4.25=10.588.\n\nNew price is 0.85 *10.588\u22489.05.\n\nSo same result, new price is ~9.\n\nBut in the options, 9 is not present. So perhaps I need to re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decreased by 15%. So perhaps the initial amount she could buy was N, and now she can buy N+5.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as:\n\nLet the original price be P. So number of articles she can buy is N=300/P.\n\nAfter price decrease by 15%, new price is 0.85P. So new number is N' =300/(0.85P).\n\nAccording to the problem, N' =N +5.\n\nSo 300/(0.85P) =300/P +5.\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. So solving gives P=45/4.25=10.588, new price is 9.05.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the options again. Wait, option C is 13.6. That's higher than the original price. That doesn't make sense because the price decreased.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the percentage. Wait, if the price decreased by 15%, the new price is 85% of the original. So perhaps I should have the original price be P, new price is 0.85P.\n\nWait, but according to my calculations, the new price is $9, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's denote the new price as x. Then the original price was x/(0.85).\n\nWait, no, that's correct. So number of articles before was 300/(x/0.85)=255/x.\n\nAfter, she can buy 300/x.\n\nSo 300/x =255/x +5 \u2192 300=255 +5x \u2192x=9.\n\nSo the new price is $9, but that's not an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the price decreased by 15% of the new price, not 15% of the original. But that would complicate things. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem states the price of each article decreased by 15%. That usually means 15% of the original price. So the new price is 85% of the original.\n\nSo I think my approach is correct, but the answer isn't among the options. That can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should set it up as the original price being P, and new price being P-0.15P=0.85P.\n\nSo, number of articles before: 300/P.\n\nNumber after:300/(0.85P).\n\nSo, 300/(0.85P) =300/P +5.\n\nWhich leads to the same equation. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try plugging the options into the equation to see if any fit.\n\nLet me try option B) $10.\n\nIf new price is $10, then original price was 10/0.85\u224811.7647.\n\nNumber of articles before:300/11.7647\u224825.5.\n\nAfter, 300/10=30. So 30-25.5=4.5. Not 5. So not matching.\n\nOption C)13.6.\n\nIf new price is 13.6, original price was 13.6/0.85=16.\n\nNumber before:300/16=18.75.\n\nAfter:300/13.6\u224822.05.\n\n22.05-18.75\u22483.3, not 5.\n\nOption E)40.\n\nNew price 40, original price 40/0.85\u224847.0588.\n\nNumber before:300/47.0588\u22486.364.\n\nAfter:300/40=7.5. 7.5-6.364\u22481.136. Not 5.\n\nOption A)8.\n\nNew price 8, original price 8/0.85\u22489.4118.\n\nNumber before:300/9.4118\u224831.87.\n\nAfter:300/8=37.5.\n\n37.5-31.87\u22485.63. Close to 5, but not exact.\n\nOption D)22.9.\n\nNew price 22.9, original price 22.9/0.85\u224827. (Wait, 0.85 *27=22.95, so 27 *0.85 is 22.95. Close to 22.9. So original price approx 27.)\n\nNumber before:300/27\u224811.111.\n\nAfter:300/22.9\u224813.09.\n\n13.09-11.111\u22481.98. Not 5.\n\nHmm, none of the options give a difference of 5 when using the new price. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me consider that the price decreased by $15, not 15%. Oh wait, but the question says the price decreased by 15%. So that's a percentage decrease, not a fixed amount. So perhaps I'm right in using 0.85P.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when I solved for x, I got 45=5x \u2192x=9, but that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is that the new price is 13.6, which is option C. Let's see.\n\nWait, if new price is 13.6, then original price is 13.6 /0.85=16.\n\nNumber before:300/16=18.75.\n\nNumber after:300/13.6\u224822.05.\n\nSo 22.05-18.75=3.3. Not 5.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me let the new price be x. So the original price is x /0.85.\n\nNumber of articles she could buy before:300/(x/0.85)=255/x.\n\nAfter the decrease, she buys 300/x articles. The difference is 5.\n\nSo 300/x -255/x =5 \u2192 (45)/x=5 \u2192x=45/5=9.\n\nSo new price is 9, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the original price, but no, the question asks for the new price.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?\"\n\nSo, after the decrease, she can buy 5 more articles for the same money. So the number of articles she can buy increases by 5. So my setup was correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. So maybe I should check my calculations again.\n\nWait, let me compute P when x=9. Original P=10.588, new price 9. So let's compute the number of articles before and after.\n\nBefore:300/10.588\u224828.333.\n\nAfter:300/9=33.333.\n\n33.333 -28.333=5. So that's correct. So the new price is 9, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are in whole dollars, and 9 isn't present. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe I should compute the new price as P*(1-0.15)=0.85P. Let me try to compute with the options.\n\nLet me take option C)13.6.\n\nIf new price is 13.6, then original price is 13.6/0.85=16.\n\nNumber before:300/16=18.75.\n\nNumber after:300/13.6\u224822.05.\n\nDifference is about 3.3, which isn't 5.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation should be:\n\nAfter the price decrease, the number of articles she can buy is 5 more than before.\n\nSo, 300/(0.85P) = (300/P) +5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 45/4.25.\n\n4.25 times 10 is 42.5. 45-42.5=2.5.\n\nSo 2.5 /4.25 = (2.5 *100)/(425) )=250/425=50/85=10/17\u22480.588.\n\nSo P=10.588, new price is 0.85 *10.588=9.05.\n\nHmm, but none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to let the new price be x, and then original price is x/0.85.\n\nSo, original number of articles: 300/(x/0.85) = (300*0.85)/x =255/x.\n\nAfter, number is 300/x.\n\nSo 300/x -255/x=5 \u219245/x=5 \u2192x=9.\n\nSo new price is 9, but it's not an option. So perhaps the problem is in the options, but that's not likely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I considered 5 more articles, but perhaps it's 5 more than the original, leading to a different setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the original number was N, and now it's N+5.\n\nSo, N=300/P.\n\nN+5=300/(0.85P).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n300/(0.85P) =300/P +5.\n\nWhich is the same equation as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should try to compute the new price from the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is $13.6, which is option C.\n\nLet me try with x=13.6.\n\nOriginal price P=13.6/0.85=16.\n\nNumber before:300/16=18.75.\n\nNumber after:300/13.6\u224822.05.\n\nDifference is 3.3, which isn't 5. So that's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me compute the number of articles before and after for each option and see which gives a difference of 5.\n\nOption A) $8.\n\nNew price x=8.\n\nOriginal price P=8/0.85\u22489.4118.\n\nNumber before:300/9.4118\u224831.87.\n\nNumber after:300/8=37.5.\n\nDifference:37.5-31.87\u22485.63. Close but not exactly 5.\n\nOption B) $10.\n\nx=10.\n\nP=10/0.85\u224811.7647.\n\nNumber before:300/11.7647\u224825.5.\n\nAfter:300/10=30.\n\nDifference:4.5. Close to 5.\n\nOption C)13.6.\n\nAs before, difference 3.3.\n\nOption E)40.\n\nx=40.\n\nP=40/0.85\u224847.0588.\n\nNumber before:300/47.0588\u22486.364.\n\nAfter:300/40=7.5.\n\nDifference:1.136.\n\nSo, the closest difference is option A)8, which gives a difference of ~5.63, and option B)10 gives 4.5.\n\nBut the problem states exactly 5 more. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the price decreased by 15%, so the new price is 85% of the original, but perhaps I should have considered the new price as P-0.15, not P*0.85. Wait, that's a big mistake! Because if the price is P, and it decreases by 15 units, that's a different scenario. But the question says the price decreased by 15%, which is a percentage, so it's 15% of the original price. So the new price is P -0.15P=0.85P.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem says the price decreased by 15, not 15%. Then the new price would be P-15. But that's not what the question says.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since none of the options give exactly 5, but option B)10 gives a difference of 4.5, which is close to 5, maybe the correct answer is B)10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me try with option B)10.\n\nx=10.\n\nOriginal price P=10/0.85\u224811.7647.\n\nNumber before:300/11.7647\u224825.5.\n\nAfter:300/10=30.\n\n30-25.5=4.5. Close to 5.\n\nSo perhaps the intended answer is B)10.\n\nBut according to my earlier calculation, the correct new price is $9, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is B)10.\n\nBut why does the calculation give 9? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the equation.\n\n300/(0.85P) = (300/P) +5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 0.85P: 300 = 0.85 *300 +5 *0.85 P \u2192300=255+4.25P \u219245=4.25P \u2192 P=45/4.25=10.588.\n\nNew price is 0.85 *10.588\u22489.05.\n\nSo the correct new price is $9.05, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are rounded. So $9.05 is closest to $10, but that's a big jump. Alternatively, perhaps the options are wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct equation is:\n\nNumber after = Number before +5.\n\nSo, 300/(0.85P) = (300/P) +5.\n\nWhich leads to P=10.588, new price 9.05.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the price decreased by 15, not 15%. But that would be a fixed decrease, not a percentage. Let me try that.\n\nIf the price decreased by $15, new price is P-15.\n\nNumber before:300/P.\n\nNumber after:300/(P-15).\n\nAccording to problem:300/(P-15)=300/P +5.\n\nMultiply both sides by P(P-15):\n\n300P =300(P-15) +5P(P-15).\n\nExpand:300P =300P -4500 +5P\u00b2-75P.\n\nSimplify:0= -4500 +5P\u00b2-75P.\n\nRearranged:5P\u00b2-75P -4500=0.\n\nDivide by 5: P\u00b2-15P -900=0.\n\nSolve using quadratic formula: P=[15 \u00b1\u221a(225 +3600)]/2 \u2192 [15 \u00b1\u221a3825]/2.\n\n\u221a3825\u224861.85.\n\nSo P=(15+61.85)/2\u224876.85/2\u224838.425. So P\u224838.43.\n\nNew price is P-15\u224823.43. Which is close to option D)22.9, but not exact. So that's probably not the intended approach.\n\nBut the problem states a 15% decrease, not a $15 decrease. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, after all this, I think the correct answer should be $9, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is B)10, which gives a difference close to 5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try one more approach.\n\nLet me assume the new price is 13.6 (option C). Then original price is 13.6/0.85=16.\n\nNumber before:300/16=18.75.\n\nNumber after:300/13.6\u224822.05.\n\nDifference:22.05-18.75=3.3.\n\nHmm, not 5.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the price decreased by 15%, so new price is P*0.85. Let me try with option C)13.6.\n\nIf new price is 13.6, then P=13.6/0.85=16.\n\nNumber before:300/16=18.75.\n\nNumber after:300/13.6\u224822.05.\n\nDifference:3.3.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Based on my calculations, the new price should be $9, but it's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is B)10, which gives a difference of 4.5, which is close to 5. Or maybe the options are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-express the equation.\n\nWait, let me write the equation again:\n\n300/(0.85P) =300/P +5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 0.85P:\n\n300 =0.85*300 +5 *0.85 P \u2192300=255+4.25P \u219245=4.25 P \u2192 P=45/4.25=10.588.\n\nSo new price is 0.85*10.588\u22489.05.\n\nBut since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is B)10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the price decreased by 15%, leading to the new price being 85% of the original. So, new price x=0.85 P \u2192P=x/0.85.\n\nNumber before:300/(x/0.85)=255/x.\n\nNumber after:300/x.\n\nSo, 300/x =255/x +5 \u219245/x=5 \u2192x=9.\n\nSo, the new price is 9, which is not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I should select the closest option, which is B)10.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C)13.6, but I can't see how.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute the difference in number of articles for each option and see which gives a difference of 5.\n\nOption A)8.\n\nOriginal price:8/0.85\u22489.4118.\n\nNumber before:300/9.4118\u224831.87.\n\nNumber after:300/8=37.5.\n\nDifference:5.63.\n\nOption B)10.\n\nOriginal price:10/0.85\u224811.7647.\n\nNumber before:300/11.7647\u224825.5.\n\nNumber after:300/10=30.\n\nDifference:4.5.\n\nOption C)13.6.\n\nOriginal price:13.6/0.85=16.\n\nNumber before:300/16=18.75.\n\nNumber after:300/13.6\u224822.05.\n\nDifference:3.3.\n\nOption D)22.9.\n\nOriginal price:22.9/0.85\u224827. (0.85*27=22.95, so 27 approx.)\n\nNumber before:300/27\u224811.111.\n\nNumber after:300/22.9\u224813.09.\n\nDifference:1.98.\n\nOption E)40.\n\nOriginal price:40/0.85\u224847.0588.\n\nNumber before:300/47.0588\u22486.364.\n\nNumber after:300/40=7.5.\n\nDifference:1.136.\n\nSo, the only option that gives a difference close to 5 is option A)8, which gives a difference of ~5.63. So perhaps the intended answer is A)8.\n\nBut earlier calculations suggest the correct answer is $9, which isn't present. So perhaps the intended answer is A)8.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Another thought: Perhaps the problem says the price decreased by 15%, so the new price is P*0.85, but perhaps I should model the number of articles after as N+5, where N is the original number.\n\nWait, but that's what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that I should have the new number being N+5, which leads to the same equation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the price is 85% of the original, so the number of articles is 1/0.85 times the original.\n\nSo, the increase in number is (1/0.85 -1) *N = (0.17647) *N =5.\n\nSo N=5/0.17647\u224828.333.\n\nSo N=300/P=28.333 \u2192P=300/28.333\u224810.588.\n\nNew price is 0.85*10.588\u22489.05.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nI'm stuck. Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is B)10, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A)8, but the calculations don't align.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the original price is P, new price is P-0.15P=0.85P.\n\nNumber before:300/P.\n\nNumber after:300/(0.85P) = (300/P) * (1/0.85) )= (300/P) *1.17647.\n\nSo, the increase is 17.647% of the original number.\n\nSo, 0.17647*(300/P)=5 \u2192300/(P)=5/0.17647\u224828.333.\n\nSo, P=300/28.333\u224810.588.\n\nNew price is 0.85*10.588\u22489.05.\n\nSo again, same result.\n\nI think I've tried all possible approaches, but the correct answer isn't among the options. So perhaps the intended answer is B)10, which gives a difference of 4.5, which is close to 5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are incorrect, and the correct answer is not listed.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by defining the original price per article as \\( P \\). After a 15% decrease, the new price becomes \\( 0.85P \\). The number of articles Anna can buy with $300 is inversely proportional to the price per article. \n\n### Key Equations:\n1. **Original number of articles**: \\( \\frac{300}{P} \\)\n2. **New number of articles**: \\( \\frac{300}{0.85P} \\)\n3. **Relationship between the two**:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{300}{0.85P} = \\frac{300}{P} + 5\n   \\]\n\n### Solving for \\( P \\):\n1. Multiply through by \\( 0.85P \\) to eliminate the denominator:\n   \\[\n   300 = 0.85P \\cdot \\frac{300}{P} + 5 \\cdot 0.85P\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   300 = 255 + 4.25P\n   \\]\n2. Subtract 255 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   45 = 4.25P\n   \\]\n3. Solve for \\( P \\):\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{45}{4.25} = 10.588\n   \\]\n\n### Finding the New Price:\nThe new price is \\( 0.85P \\):\n\\[\n\\text{New price} = 0.85 \\times 10.588 \\approx 9.05\n\\]\n\n### Verifying with the Options:\nThe calculated new price of approximately $9.05 does not match any of the given options. To identify the closest match, we test each option by calculating the original price and the difference in the number of articles before and after the price decrease:\n\n1. **Option A ($8)**:\n   - Original price: \\( \\frac{8}{0.85} \\approx 9.4118 \\)\n   - Number before: \\( \\frac{300}{9.4118} \\approx 31.87 \\)\n   - Number after: \\( \\frac{300}{8} = 37.5 \\)\n   - Difference: \\( 37.5 - 31.87 \\approx 5.63 \\)\n\n2. **Option B ($10)**:\n   - Original price: \\( \\frac{10}{0.85} \\approx 11.7647 \\)\n   - Number before: \\( \\frac{300}{11.7647} \\approx 25.5 \\)\n   - Number after: \\( \\frac{300}{10} = 30 \\)\n   - Difference: \\( 30 - 25.5 = 4.5 \\)\n\n3. **Option C ($13.6)**:\n   - Original price: \\( \\frac{13.6}{0.85} = 16 \\)\n   - Number before: \\( \\frac{300}{16} = 18.75 \\)\n   - Number after: \\( \\frac{300}{13.6} \\approx 22.05 \\)\n   - Difference: \\( 22.05 - 18.75 = 3.3 \\)\n\n4. **Option D ($22.9)**:\n   - Original price: \\( \\frac{22.9}{0.85} \\approx 27 \\)\n   - Number before: \\( \\frac{300}{27} \\approx 11.111 \\)\n   - Number after: \\( \\frac{300}{22.9} \\approx 13.09 \\)\n   - Difference: \\( 13.09 - 11.111 \\approx 1.98 \\)\n\n5. **Option E ($40)**:\n   - Original price: \\( \\frac{40}{0.85} \\approx 47.0588 \\)\n   - Number before: \\( \\frac{300}{47.0588} \\approx 6.364 \\)\n   - Number after: \\( \\frac{300}{40} = 7.5 \\)\n   - Difference: \\( 7.5 - 6.364 \\approx 1.136 \\)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe calculated new price of $9.05 is not listed among the options. However, the closest match is **Option B ($10)**, which gives a difference of 4.5 articles, nearest to the required increase of 5 articles.\n\nANSWER: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here that Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. I need to find the new selling price of each article. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nAlright, so initially, let's say the price per article was P dollars. After a 15% decrease, the new price becomes P minus 15% of P. Which is the same as P multiplied by (1 - 0.15), so 0.85P. Got it.\n\nNow, Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for the same $300. So before the price decrease, she could buy a certain number of articles, and now she can buy that number plus 5.\n\nLet me write this out. Let's let the original number of articles she could buy be N. So N equals 300 divided by the original price P. N = 300 / P.\n\nAfter the price decrease, the new price is 0.85P, so the new number of articles she can buy is 300 divided by (0.85P). Let's call this new number N + 5 because she can buy 5 more.\n\nSo N +5 = 300 / (0.85P).\n\nBut I know that N is 300/P, so substituting that in:\n\n(300/P) + 5 = 300/(0.85P).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to solve for P. Let me rearrange the equation.\n\nLet me subtract (300/P) from both sides:\n\n5 = [300/(0.85P)] - [300/P].\n\nHmm, so 5 equals 300/(0.85P) minus 300/P. Let me factor out 300/P:\n\n5 = (300/P) * (1/0.85 - 1).\n\nWait, 1/0.85 is the same as 1 divided by 0.85. Let me calculate that. 0.85 is 17/20, so 1 divided by 0.85 is 20/17, which is approximately 1.1765. But maybe I'll keep it as fractions for accuracy.\n\nSo 1/0.85 is 20/17. So 20/17 minus 1 is 3/17. So:\n\n5 = (300/P) * (3/17).\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n5 = (300 *3)/(17 P).\n\nSo 5 = 900/(17 P).\n\nWait, 300 *3 is 900, right. So 5 = 900/(17 P).\n\nI can rearrange this to solve for P. Multiply both sides by 17 P:\n\n5 *17 P =900.\n\nSo 85 P =900.\n\nThen P =900 /85.\n\nLet me calculate that. 85 times 10 is 850, so 900 minus 850 is 50. So 900/85 is 10 and 50/85. Simplify 50/85: divide numerator and denominator by 5, that's 10/17. So P is 10 + 10/17 dollars, which is approximately 10.588 dollars.\n\nBut wait, I'm supposed to find the new price, which is 0.85 times the original P. So new price is 0.85P.\n\nSo 0.85 * (900/85) = let's see. 900 divided by 85 is P, so 0.85 times that is (900/85)*0.85. Oh, wait, 0.85 is the same as 85/100. So (900/85) * (85/100) = 900/100 =9. So the new price is $9?\n\nWait, but looking at the options, I don't see $9. The options are A)$8, B)$10, C)$13.6, D)$22.9, E)$40. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in my calculation?\n\nLet me go back. Maybe I messed up somewhere. Let me redo the steps.\n\nOriginal price = P.\n\nNumber of articles before = 300/P.\n\nAfter 15% decrease, new price is 0.85P.\n\nNumber after = 300/(0.85P) = 300/(0.85P).\n\nAnd this is 5 more than before, so:\n\n300/(0.85P) = 300/P +5.\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\n300/(0.85P) = (300 +5P)/P.\n\nWait, perhaps cross-multiplying would help.\n\nMultiply both sides by 0.85P:\n\n300 = 0.85P * (300/P +5).\n\nWait, that might be a better approach. Let's try that.\n\n300 = 0.85P * (300/P +5).\n\nExpanding the right side: 0.85P*(300/P) + 0.85P*5.\n\nSimplify each term: 0.85 *300 + 5 *0.85 P.\n\nSo 0.85*300 is 255, and 5*0.85 is 4.25. So right side is 255 +4.25 P.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n300 =255 +4.25 P.\n\nSubtract 255 from both sides: 300-255=45 =4.25 P.\n\nSo P=45 /4.25.\n\nLet me compute that. 4.25 is the same as 17/4. So 45 divided by (17/4) is 45 *4/17 = 180/17 \u224810.588. So P is about $10.588.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before. So new price is 0.85 * P.\n\n0.85 * (180/17) = (0.85 * 180)/17.\n\n0.85 *180: 0.85 *180 is 153.\n\nSo 153 divided by 17 is 9. Because 17 *9 is 153. So new price is $9.\n\nBut the options don't have 9. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the new number of articles is N+5, so let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: Let me let the new price be x. So the original price was x / (1 - 0.15) = x /0.85.\n\nBecause the new price is 85% of the original.\n\nSo original price P = x /0.85.\n\nAnna can buy 300 / P articles before, which is 300 *0.85 /x = 255 /x.\n\nAfter the price drop, she can buy 300 /x articles.\n\nAccording to the problem, 300/x = (255/x) +5.\n\nSo 300/x =255/x +5.\n\nSubtract 255/x from both sides: 45/x =5.\n\nSo 45/x=5 \u2192 x=45/5=9.\n\nSo x is $9. Again, same result. So why isn't 9 an option?\n\nWait, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?\"\n\nWait, perhaps I swapped the numbers. Let me check.\n\nWait, she buys 5 more articles for the same amount, so if the price decreased, she can buy more. So the new price is lower, so the number of articles she can buy increases.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, the new price is $9, which is not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in my setup.\n\nWait, maybe I should set up the equations differently. Let me try.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet the original price be P.\n\nNumber of articles before: N = 300 / P.\n\nAfter 15% decrease, new price is 0.85P.\n\nNumber of articles now: N +5 = 300 / (0.85P).\n\nSo, N +5 =300/(0.85P).\n\nBut N is 300/P.\n\nSo,\n\n300/P +5 =300/(0.85P).\n\nMultiply all terms by P to eliminate denominators:\n\n300 +5P = 300/(0.85).\n\nWait, 300/(0.85) is the same as 300 * (20/17) = 6000/17 \u2248352.941.\n\nSo 300 +5P = 352.941.\n\nSubtract 300: 5P=52.941.\n\nP=52.941/5=10.588.\n\nWhich brings me back to the same P as before. So new price is 0.85 *10.588 \u22489.\n\nHmm. So the new price is $9, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, looking at the options again: A)8, B)10, C)13.6, D)22.9, E)40.\n\nHmm. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the 5 more articles is the difference in the number of articles she can buy for $300 before and after the price decrease. So the equation should be:\n\nNumber after = Number before +5.\n\nNumber after is 300/(0.85P), number before is 300/P.\n\nSo 300/(0.85P) = 300/P +5.\n\nWait, that's what I did earlier. So why isn't 9 an option?\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, 300/(0.85P) = 300/P +5.\n\nLet me rewrite this as:\n\n300/(0.85P) - 300/P =5.\n\nFactor 300/P:\n\n300/(P) [1/0.85 -1] =5.\n\nCompute 1/0.85 -1: 1/0.85 is approx 1.17647, minus 1 is 0.17647.\n\nSo,\n\n300/(P) *0.17647 =5.\n\n0.17647 is approximately 1/5.65, but perhaps it's exactly 3/17 as before.\n\nSo,\n\n300 * 3/(17 P) =5.\n\nWhich is 900/(17 P)=5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 17 P: 900 = 85 P.\n\nSo P=900/85= 10.588.\n\nSo new price is 0.85 *10.588=9. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but options don't have 9. Did I misinterpret the question? Maybe the $300 is the total after the price decrease, not before.\n\nWait, wait, the question says she is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decreased. So perhaps she uses $300, which is the same as before, but now buys 5 more.\n\nSo perhaps my setup is correct. But the options don't have 9, which suggests that either I'm wrong or the options are wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the percentage is a 15% increase, not decrease? Let me check.\n\nWait, the question says the price decreased by 15%. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 300/(0.85P) again.\n\nWait, let me compute 300/(0.85P) =300/(0.85 * (900/85)).\n\nWait, 0.85*(900/85) is (0.85*900)/85.\n\n0.85 *900=765.\n\n765/85=9.\n\nSo 300/(0.85P)=300/9=33.333.\n\nWait, and 300/P is 300/(900/85)= 300 *85/900= (300/900)*85= (1/3)*85\u224828.333.\n\nSo 28.333 +5=33.333, which matches. So the calculation is correct.\n\nSo the new price is $9, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I assumed the original price was P, and the new price is 0.85 P. But what if the question meant that the price increased by 15%? No, the question says decreased.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the total price, not per article. No, the question says price of each article decreased.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me assume that the new price is x. Then the original price was x / (1 - 0.15) = x / 0.85.\n\nSo, original price P =x /0.85.\n\nThe number of articles she could buy initially is 300 / P = 300 *0.85 /x = 255/x.\n\nAfter the price drop, she can buy 300 /x articles.\n\nAccording to the problem, 300/x = (255/x) +5.\n\nSo, 300/x =255/x +5 \u2192 45/x=5 \u2192 x=45/5=9.\n\nAgain, same result. So perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the question said that the price increased by 15%? Let me check the question again.\n\nNo, it says decreased by 15%. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should re-express the equations. Let me think about the relationship between the number of articles.\n\nLet me denote the original number as N and the new number as N+5.\n\nSo,\n\nN =300 / P,\n\nN+5=300/(0.85 P).\n\nSo, subtracting,\n\nN+5 -N =5 =300/(0.85 P) -300/P.\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo 5=300*(1/(0.85 P) -1/P).\n\nFactor 300/P:\n\n5=300/P (1/0.85 -1).\n\nCompute 1/0.85: 1/0.85 =1.176470588.\n\nSo 1.176470588 -1=0.176470588.\n\nSo,\n\n5=300/P *0.176470588.\n\nMultiply both sides by P:\n\n5P=300 *0.176470588.\n\nCompute 300 *0.176470588.\n\nWell, 0.176470588 is approximately 176.470588/1000, but perhaps exact value is 3/17.\n\nWait, because 3/17 is approximately 0.17647.\n\nSo,\n\n5P=300 * (3/17).\n\nSo 5P=900/17.\n\nP=180/17 \u224810.588.\n\nSo new price is 0.85 *10.588=9.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nWait, the options don't have 9. So perhaps the problem is intended to have an option not present, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me try another approach.\n\nSuppose the original price is P, and the new price is 0.85 P.\n\nThe amount of money is $300.\n\nNumber before: 300/P.\n\nNumber after: 300/(0.85 P).\n\nThe difference is 5.\n\nSo,\n\n300/(0.85 P) -300/P =5.\n\nFactor 300/P:\n\n300/P (1/0.85 -1) =5.\n\nWhich is,\n\n300/P * (1/0.85 -1) =5.\n\n1/0.85 is 1.17647, minus 1 is 0.17647.\n\nSo,\n\n300/P *0.17647=5.\n\nMultiply both sides by P:\n\n300 *0.17647 =5 P.\n\nSo,\n\n5 P=300 *0.17647=52.941.\n\nSo P=52.941 /5=10.588.\n\nNew price is 0.85 *10.588=9.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question was to find the original price, but the question says new price.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated 0.85 * (900/85). Let me compute 900/85.\n\n900 divided by 85.\n\n85 *10=850, 85*10=850, so 900-850=50. So 900/85=10 +50/85=10 +10/17=approx 10.588.\n\n0.85 *10.588 = let's compute 10.588 *0.85.\n\n10 *0.85=8.5.\n\n0.588 *0.85= approx 0.588 *0.85.\n\n0.5 *0.85=0.425.\n\n0.088 *0.85\u22480.0748.\n\nSo total is 0.425 +0.0748=0.4998\u22480.5.\n\nSo 8.5 +0.5=9.\n\nSo yes, new price is $9. But it's not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that the price increased, not decreased. Let me check.\n\nNo, the question says decreased by 15%. So I think I'm correct.\n\nWait, looking at the options, perhaps option C is 13.6, which is 900/66.15 or something. Wait, maybe I should compute 300/(0.85 P) and see if any of the options fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should test the options to see which one fits.\n\nLet's try option B)10.\n\nIf the new price is $10, then the original price was 10 /0.85= approx 11.7647.\n\nNumber before: 300/11.7647\u224825.5.\n\nNumber after:300/10=30.\n\nDifference is 30-25.5=4.5, not 5. So not correct.\n\nOption A)8.\n\nNew price 8. Original price 8/0.85\u22489.4118.\n\nNumber before:300/9.4118\u224831.88, so about 32.\n\nNumber after:300/8=37.5.\n\nDifference is 37.5-32=5.5.

Not 5.\n\nHmm. None of the options give a difference of exactly 5. But option A gives a difference of 5.5, which is close but not exactly 5.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if the new price is 10.588, which is approximately 10.59. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that the price decreased by 15%, so the new price is 85% of the original. So if the new price is x, original is x/0.85.\n\nAnna can buy 300/x articles at the new price.\n\nShe could buy 300/(x/0.85) = 300 *0.85 /x =255/x articles before.\n\nThe difference is 300/x -255/x =45/x =5.\n\nSo 45/x=5 \u2192x=9.\n\nSame result. So again, x is 9, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended the price to decrease by 15% of the new price, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the original price. But the question asks for the new price.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are wrong. But I have to choose from the given options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in setting up the equation. Let me try again.\n\nWait, let me let the new price be x. So original price is x /0.85.\n\nNumber before:300/(x/0.85)=300*0.85/x=255/x.\n\nNumber after:300/x.\n\nDifference:300/x -255/x=45/x=5.\n\nSo 45/x=5 \u2192x=9.\n\nSo the correct answer is $9, but it's not listed. So perhaps the intended answer is $10, which is option B.\n\nWait, perhaps the question meant that the price decreased by 1/15, not 15%. No, the question says 15% decrease.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option B.\n\nBut wait, I think I must have made a mistake somewhere because the answer isn't among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the new price as 300 divided by the new number of articles. Let me think.\n\nWait, let me approach it this way.\n\nLet the new price be x.\n\nSo the number of articles she can buy now is 300/x.\n\nBefore the price decrease, she could buy 300/(x/0.85) = 300*0.85/x =255/x.\n\nThe difference is 300/x -255/x =45/x=5.\n\nSo 45/x=5 \u2192x=9.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo I'm confident the new price is $9. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe the question said the price increased by 15% instead of decreased. Let me test that.\n\nIf the price increased by 15%, new price is 1.15P.\n\nThen, the original number would be 300/P, and new number 300/(1.15 P).\n\nThe difference would be 300/(1.15 P) -300/P = -300(1/(1.15 P) -1/P) = negative, so she buys fewer, which is not the case.\n\nSo the problem must be a decrease.\n\nHmm.

So none of the options give a difference of exactly 5, except perhaps option A, which gives 5.5. But that's not exact.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if the new price is 10.588, which is approximately 10.59, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the price decreased by 15%, so the new price is 85% of the original, so the number of articles she can buy increases by 1/(0.85) -1 = approx 17.647% increase. So the increase in number is 17.647% of the original number, which equals 5.\n\nSo, 0.17647 *N=5 \u2192 N=5/0.17647\u224828.333.\n\nSo original number N\u224828.333, which would mean original price P=300/28.333\u224810.588.\n\nNew price is 0.85 *10.588=9.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nSo I'm confident that the correct answer is $9, but it's not listed. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the question intended the price to decrease by 15 dollars, not 15%? That would be a different approach. Let me try that.\n\nIf the price decreased by $15, then new price is P-15.\n\nNumber before:300/P.\n\nNumber after:300/(P-15).\n\nDifference:300/(P-15) -300/P=5.\n\nSo,\n\n300/(P-15) =300/P +5.\n\nMultiply both sides by P(P-15):\n\n300P =300(P-15) +5P(P-15).\n\nExpand:\n\n300P=300P -4500 +5P\u00b2 -75P.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n0= -4500 +5P\u00b2 -75P.\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n0= -900 + P\u00b2 -15P.\n\nRearranged: P\u00b2 -15P -900=0.\n\nUse quadratic formula: P=(15\u00b1\u221a(225 +3600))/2= (15\u00b1\u221a3825)/2.\n\n\u221a3825 is approx 61.85.\n\nSo P=(15 +61.85)/2\u224876.85/2\u224838.425.\n\nSo new price would be 38.425-15=23.425. Which is not an option either.\n\nSo that approach doesn't help.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possibilities and the correct answer is $9, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option B)10, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo, but given the options, I'll have to choose the closest one.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here that Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. I need to find the new selling price of each article. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nAlright, so initially, let's say the price per article was P dollars. After a 15% decrease, the new price becomes P minus 15% of P. Which is the same as P multiplied by (1 - 0.15), so 0.85P. Got it.\n\nNow, Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for the same $300. So before the price decrease, she could buy a certain number of articles, and now she can buy that number plus 5.\n\nLet me write this out. Let's let the original number of articles she could buy be N. So N equals 300 divided by the original price P. N = 300 / P.\n\nAfter the price decrease, the new price is 0.85P, so the new number of articles she can buy is 300 divided by (0.85P). Let's call this new number N + 5 because she can buy 5 more.\n\nSo N +5 = 300 / (0.85P).\n\nBut I know that N is 300/P, so substituting that in:\n\n(300/P) + 5 = 300/(0.85P).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to solve for P. Let me rearrange the equation.\n\nLet me subtract (300/P) from both sides:\n\n5 = [300/(0.85P)] - [300/P].\n\nHmm, so 5 equals 300/(0.85P) minus 300/P. Let me factor out 300/P:\n\n5 = (300/P) * (1/0.85 - 1).\n\nWait, 1/0.85 is the same as 1 divided by 0.85. Let me calculate that. 0.85 is 17/20, so 1 divided by 0.85 is 20/17, which is approximately 1.1765. But maybe I'll keep it as fractions for accuracy.\n\nSo 1/0.85 is 20/17. So 20/17 minus 1 is 3/17. So:\n\n5 = (300/P) * (3/17).\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n5 = (300 *3)/(17 P).\n\nSo 5 = 900/(17 P).\n\nWait, 300 *3 is 900, right. So 5 = 900/(17 P).\n\nI can rearrange this to solve for P. Multiply both sides by 17 P:\n\n5 *17 P =900.\n\nSo 85 P =900.\n\nThen P =900 /85.\n\nLet me calculate that. 85 times 10 is 850, so 900 minus 850 is 50. So 900/85 is 10 and 50/85. Simplify 50/85: divide numerator and denominator by 5, that's 10/17. So P is 10 + 10/17 dollars, which is approximately 10.588 dollars.\n\nBut wait, I'm supposed to find the new price, which is 0.85 times the original P. So new price is 0.85P.\n\nSo 0.85 * (900/85) = let's see. 900 divided by 85 is P, so 0.85 times that is (900/85)*0.85. Oh, wait, 0.85 is the same as 85/100. So (900/85) * (85/100) = 900/100 =9. So the new price is $9?\n\nWait, but looking at the options, I don't see $9. The options are A)$8, B)$10, C)$13.6, D)$22.9, E)$40. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in my calculation?\n\nLet me go back. Maybe I messed up somewhere. Let me redo the steps.\n\nOriginal price = P.\n\nNumber of articles before = 300/P.\n\nAfter 15% decrease, new price is 0.85P.\n\nNumber after = 300/(0.85P) = 300/(0.85P).\n\nAnd this is 5 more than before, so:\n\n300/(0.85P) = 300/P +5.\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\n300/(0.85P) = (300 +5P)/P.\n\nWait, perhaps cross-multiplying would help.\n\nMultiply both sides by 0.85P:\n\n300 = 0.85P * (300/P +5).\n\nWait, that might be a better approach. Let's try that.\n\n300 = 0.85P * (300/P +5).\n\nExpanding the right side: 0.85P*(300/P) + 0.85P*5.\n\nSimplify each term: 0.85 *300 + 5 *0.85 P.\n\nSo 0.85*300 is 255, and 5*0.85 is 4.25. So right side is 255 +4.25 P.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n300 =255 +4.25 P.\n\nSubtract 255 from both sides: 300-255=45 =4.25 P.\n\nSo P=45 /4.25.\n\nLet me compute that. 4.25 is the same as 17/4. So 45 divided by (17/4) is 45 *4/17 = 180/17 \u224810.588. So P is about $10.588.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before. So new price is 0.85 * P.\n\n0.85 * (180/17) = (0.85 * 180)/17.\n\n0.85 *180: 0.85 *180 is 153.\n\nSo 153 divided by 17 is 9. Because 17 *9 is 153. So new price is $9.\n\nBut the options don't have 9. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the new number of articles is N+5, so let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: Let me let the new price be x. So the original price was x / (1 - 0.15) = x /0.85.\n\nBecause the new price is 85% of the original.\n\nSo original price P = x /0.85.\n\nAnna can buy 300 / P articles before, which is 300 *0.85 /x = 255 /x.\n\nAfter the price drop, she can buy 300 /x articles.\n\nAccording to the problem, 300/x = (255/x) +5.\n\nSo 300/x =255/x +5.\n\nSubtract 255/x from both sides: 45/x =5.\n\nSo 45/x=5 \u2192 x=45/5=9.\n\nSo x is $9. Again, same result. So why isn't 9 an option?\n\nWait, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?\"\n\nWait, perhaps I swapped the numbers. Let me check.\n\nWait, she buys 5 more articles for the same amount, so if the price decreased, she can buy more. So the new price is lower, so the number of articles she can buy increases.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, the new price is $9, which is not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in my setup.\n\nWait, maybe I should set up the equations differently. Let me try.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet the original price be P.\n\nNumber of articles before: N = 300 / P.\n\nAfter 15% decrease, new price is 0.85P.\n\nNumber of articles now: N +5 = 300 / (0.85P).\n\nSo, N +5 =300/(0.85P).\n\nBut N is 300/P.\n\nSo,\n\n300/P +5 =300/(0.85P).\n\nMultiply all terms by P to eliminate denominators:\n\n300 +5P = 300/(0.85).\n\nWait, 300/(0.85) is the same as 300 * (20/17) = 6000/17 \u2248352.941.\n\nSo 300 +5P = 352.941.\n\nSubtract 300: 5P=52.941.\n\nP=52.941/5=10.588.\n\nWhich brings me back to the same P as before. So new price is 0.85 *10.588 \u22489.\n\nHmm. So the new price is $9, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, looking at the options again: A)8, B)10, C)13.6, D)22.9, E)40.\n\nHmm. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the 5 more articles is the difference in the number of articles she can buy for $300 before and after the price decrease. So the equation should be:\n\nNumber after = Number before +5.\n\nNumber after is 300/(0.85P), number before is 300/P.\n\nSo 300/(0.85P) = 300/P +5.\n\nWait, that's what I did earlier. So why isn't 9 an option?\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, 300/(0.85P) = 300/P +5.\n\nLet me rewrite this as:\n\n300/(0.85P) - 300/P =5.\n\nFactor 300/P:\n\n300/(P) [1/0.85 -1] =5.\n\nCompute 1/0.85 -1: 1/0.85 is approx 1.17647, minus 1 is 0.17647.\n\nSo,\n\n300/(P) *0.17647 =5.\n\n0.17647 is approximately 1/5.65, but perhaps it's exactly 3/17 as before.\n\nSo,\n\n300 * 3/(17 P) =5.\n\nWhich is 900/(17 P)=5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 17 P: 900 = 85 P.\n\nSo P=900/85= 10.588.\n\nSo new price is 0.85 *10.588=9. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but options don't have 9. Did I misinterpret the question? Maybe the $300 is the total after the price decrease, not before.\n\nWait, wait, the question says she is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decreased. So perhaps she uses $300, which is the same as before, but now buys 5 more.\n\nSo perhaps my setup is correct. But the options don't have 9, which suggests that either I'm wrong or the options are wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the percentage is a 15% increase, not decrease? Let me check.\n\nWait, the question says the price decreased by 15%. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 300/(0.85P) again.\n\nWait, let me compute 300/(0.85P) =300/(0.85 * (900/85)).\n\nWait, 0.85*(900/85) is (0.85*900)/85.\n\n0.85 *900=765.\n\n765/85=9.\n\nSo 300/(0.85P)=300/9=33.333.\n\nWait, and 300/P is 300/(900/85)= 300 *85/900= (300/900)*85= (1/3)*85\u224828.333.\n\nSo 28.333 +5=33.333, which matches. So the calculation is correct.\n\nSo the new price is $9, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I assumed the original price was P, and the new price is 0.85 P. But what if the question meant that the price increased by 15%? No, the question says decreased.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the total price, not per article. No, the question says price of each article decreased.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me assume that the new price is x. Then the original price was x / (1 - 0.15) = x / 0.85.\n\nSo, original price P =x /0.85.\n\nThe number of articles she could buy initially is 300 / P = 300 *0.85 /x = 255/x.\n\nAfter the price drop, she can buy 300 /x articles.\n\nAccording to the problem, 300/x = (255/x) +5.\n\nSo, 300/x =255/x +5 \u2192 45/x=5 \u2192 x=45/5=9.\n\nAgain, same result. So perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the question said that the price increased by 15%? Let me check the question again.\n\nNo, it says decreased by 15%. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should re-express the equations. Let me think about the relationship between the number of articles.\n\nLet me denote the original number as N and the new number as N+5.\n\nSo,\n\nN =300 / P,\n\nN+5=300/(0.85 P).\n\nSo, subtracting,\n\nN+5 -N =5 =300/(0.85 P) -300/P.\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo 5=300*(1/(0.85 P) -1/P).\n\nFactor 300/P:\n\n5=300/P (1/0.85 -1).\n\nCompute 1/0.85: 1/0.85 =1.176470588.\n\nSo 1.176470588 -1=0.176470588.\n\nSo,\n\n5=300/P *0.176470588.\n\nMultiply both sides by P:\n\n5P=300 *0.176470588.\n\nCompute 300 *0.176470588.\n\nWell, 0.176470588 is approximately 176.470588/1000, but perhaps exact value is 3/17.\n\nWait, because 3/17 is approximately 0.17647.\n\nSo,\n\n5P=300 * (3/17).\n\nSo 5P=900/17.\n\nP=180/17 \u224810.588.\n\nSo new price is 0.85 *10.588=9.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nWait, the options don't have 9. So perhaps the problem is intended to have an option not present, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me try another approach.\n\nSuppose the original price is P, and the new price is 0.85 P.\n\nThe amount of money is $300.\n\nNumber before: 300/P.\n\nNumber after: 300/(0.85 P).\n\nThe difference is 5.\n\nSo,\n\n300/(0.85 P) -300/P =5.\n\nFactor 300/P:\n\n300/P (1/0.85 -1) =5.\n\nWhich is,\n\n300/P * (1/0.85 -1) =5.\n\n1/0.85 is 1.17647, minus 1 is 0.17647.\n\nSo,\n\n300/P *0.17647=5.\n\nMultiply both sides by P:\n\n300 *0.17647 =5 P.\n\nSo,\n\n5 P=300 *0.17647=52.941.\n\nSo P=52.941 /5=10.588.\n\nNew price is 0.85 *10.588=9.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question was to find the original price, but the question says new price.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated 0.85 * (900/85). Let me compute 900/85.\n\n900 divided by 85.\n\n85 *10=850, 85*10=850, so 900-850=50. So 900/85=10 +50/85=10 +10/17=approx 10.588.\n\n0.85 *10.588 = let's compute 10.588 *0.85.\n\n10 *0.85=8.5.\n\n0.588 *0.85= approx 0.588 *0.85.\n\n0.5 *0.85=0.425.\n\n0.088 *0.85\u22480.0748.\n\nSo total is 0.425 +0.0748=0.4998\u22480.5.\n\nSo 8.5 +0.5=9.\n\nSo yes, new price is $9. But it's not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that the price increased, not decreased. Let me check.\n\nNo, the question says decreased by 15%. So I think I'm correct.\n\nWait, looking at the options, perhaps option C is 13.6, which is 900/66.15 or something. Wait, maybe I should compute 300/(0.85 P) and see if any of the options fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should test the options to see which one fits.\n\nLet's try option B)10.\n\nIf the new price is $10, then the original price was 10 /0.85= approx 11.7647.\n\nNumber before: 300/11.7647\u224825.5.\n\nNumber after:300/10=30.\n\nDifference is 30-25.5=4.5, not 5. So not correct.\n\nOption A)8.\n\nNew price 8. Original price 8/0.85\u22489.4118.\n\nNumber before:300/9.4118\u224831.88, so about 32.\n\nNumber after:300/8=37.5.\n\nDifference is 37.5-32=5.5. Close, but not exactly 5.\n\nOption C)13.6.\n\nNew price 13.6.\n\nOriginal price:13.6 /0.85=16.\n\nNumber before:300/16=18.75.\n\nNumber after:300/13.6\u224822.05.\n\nDifference is 22.05-18.75=3.3. Not 5.\n\nOption E)40.\n\nNew price 40.\n\nOriginal price 40/0.85\u224847.0588.\n\nNumber before:300/47.0588\u22486.36.\n\nNumber after:300/40=7.5.\n\nDifference 1.14. Not 5.\n\nOption D)22.9.\n\nNew price 22.9.\n\nOriginal price 22.9/0.85\u224826.94.\n\nNumber before:300/26.94\u224811.13.\n\nNumber after:300/22.9\u224813.09.\n\nDifference is about 1.96. Not 5.\n\nHmm. None of the options give a difference of exactly 5. But option A gives a difference of 5.5, which is close but not exactly 5.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if the new price is 10.588, which is approximately 10.59. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that the price decreased by 15%, so the new price is 85% of the original. So if the new price is x, original is x/0.85.\n\nAnna can buy 300/x articles at the new price.\n\nShe could buy 300/(x/0.85) = 300 *0.85 /x =255/x articles before.\n\nThe difference is 300/x -255/x =45/x =5.\n\nSo 45/x=5 \u2192x=9.\n\nSame result. So again, x is 9, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended the price to decrease by 15% of the new price, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the original price. But the question asks for the new price.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are wrong. But I have to choose from the given options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in setting up the equation. Let me try again.\n\nWait, let me let the new price be x. So original price is x /0.85.\n\nNumber before:300/(x/0.85)=300*0.85/x=255/x.\n\nNumber after:300/x.\n\nDifference:300/x -255/x=45/x=5.\n\nSo 45/x=5 \u2192x=9.\n\nSo the correct answer is $9, but it's not listed. So perhaps the intended answer is $10, which is option B.\n\nWait, perhaps the question meant that the price decreased by 1/15, not 15%. No, the question says 15% decrease.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo. But in the absence of that, I have to choose the best possible answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if the new price is $10, and see if the difference in the number of articles is 5.\n\nNew price $10.\n\nOriginal price:10 /0.85\u224811.7647.\n\nNumber before:300/11.7647\u224825.5.\n\nNumber after:300/10=30.\n\nDifference:4.5, not 5. Close but not exact.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B)10, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option B.\n\nBut wait, I think I must have made a mistake somewhere because the answer isn't among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the new price as 300 divided by the new number of articles. Let me think.\n\nWait, let me approach it this way.\n\nLet the new price be x.\n\nSo the number of articles she can buy now is 300/x.\n\nBefore the price decrease, she could buy 300/(x/0.85) = 300*0.85/x =255/x.\n\nThe difference is 300/x -255/x =45/x=5.\n\nSo 45/x=5 \u2192x=9.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo I'm confident the new price is $9. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe the question said the price increased by 15% instead of decreased. Let me test that.\n\nIf the price increased by 15%, new price is 1.15P.\n\nThen, the original number would be 300/P, and new number 300/(1.15 P).\n\nThe difference would be 300/(1.15 P) -300/P = -300(1/(1.15 P) -1/P) = negative, so she buys fewer, which is not the case.\n\nSo the problem must be a decrease.\n\nHmm. Maybe the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to compute the new price using the options and see which one gives a 5 difference.\n\nLet me try option B)10.\n\nNew price x=10.\n\nOriginal price P=10/0.85\u224811.7647.\n\nNumber before:300/11.7647\u224825.5.\n\nNumber after:300/10=30.\n\nDifference:4.5. Not 5.\n\nOption C)13.6.\n\nx=13.6.\n\nP=13.6/0.85=16.\n\nNumber before:300/16=18.75.\n\nNumber after:300/13.6\u224822.05.\n\nDifference:3.3. Not 5.\n\nOption A)8.\n\nx=8.\n\nP=8/0.85\u22489.4118.\n\nNumber before:300/9.4118\u224831.88.\n\nNumber after:300/8=37.5.\n\nDifference:5.62. Close to 5.5, but not exactly 5.\n\nOption E)40.\n\nx=40.\n\nP=40/0.85\u224847.0588.\n\nNumber before:300/47.0588\u22486.36.\n\nNumber after:300/40=7.5.\n\nDifference:1.14. Not 5.\n\nOption D)22.9.\n\nx=22.9.\n\nP=22.9/0.85\u224826.94.\n\nNumber before:300/26.94\u224811.13.\n\nNumber after:300/22.9\u224813.09.\n\nDifference:1.96. Not 5.\n\nHmm. So none of the options give a difference of exactly 5, except perhaps option A, which gives 5.5. But that's not exact.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if the new price is 10.588, which is approximately 10.59, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the price decreased by 15%, so the new price is 85% of the original, so the number of articles she can buy increases by 1/(0.85) -1 = approx 17.647% increase. So the increase in number is 17.647% of the original number, which equals 5.\n\nSo, 0.17647 *N=5 \u2192 N=5/0.17647\u224828.333.\n\nSo original number N\u224828.333, which would mean original price P=300/28.333\u224810.588.\n\nNew price is 0.85 *10.588=9.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nSo I'm confident that the correct answer is $9, but it's not listed. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the question intended the price to decrease by 15 dollars, not 15%? That would be a different approach. Let me try that.\n\nIf the price decreased by $15, then new price is P-15.\n\nNumber before:300/P.\n\nNumber after:300/(P-15).\n\nDifference:300/(P-15) -300/P=5.\n\nSo,\n\n300/(P-15) =300/P +5.\n\nMultiply both sides by P(P-15):\n\n300P =300(P-15) +5P(P-15).\n\nExpand:\n\n300P=300P -4500 +5P\u00b2 -75P.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n0= -4500 +5P\u00b2 -75P.\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n0= -900 + P\u00b2 -15P.\n\nRearranged: P\u00b2 -15P -900=0.\n\nUse quadratic formula: P=(15\u00b1\u221a(225 +3600))/2= (15\u00b1\u221a3825)/2.\n\n\u221a3825 is approx 61.85.\n\nSo P=(15 +61.85)/2\u224876.85/2\u224838.425.\n\nSo new price would be 38.425-15=23.425. Which is not an option either.\n\nSo that approach doesn't help.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possibilities and the correct answer is $9, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option B)10, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo, but given the options, I'll have to choose the closest one.\n\n\nAnna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. To find the new selling price of each article, we start by denoting the original price per article as \\( P \\). After a 15% decrease, the new price becomes \\( 0.85P \\).\n\nThe number of articles Anna could buy before the price decrease is \\( \\frac{300}{P} \\). After the price decrease, the number of articles she can buy is \\( \\frac{300}{0.85P} \\). According to the problem, the difference in the number of articles is 5:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{0.85P} - \\frac{300}{P} = 5\n\\]\n\nFactoring \\( \\frac{300}{P} \\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{P} \\left( \\frac{1}{0.85} - 1 \\right) = 5\n\\]\n\nSimplify \\( \\frac{1}{0.85} - 1 \\). Since \\( \\frac{1}{0.85} = \\frac{20}{17} \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{17} - 1 = \\frac{3}{17}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{P} \\cdot \\frac{3}{17} = 5\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{900}{17P} = 5\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( 17P \\):\n\n\\[\n900 = 85P\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( P \\):\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{900}{85} \\approx 10.588\n\\]\n\nThe new price per article is \\( 0.85P \\):\n\n\\[\n0.85 \\times 10.588 \\approx 9\n\\]\n\nThus, the new selling price per article is $9. However, $9 is not listed among the options. Testing the given options to check if any yield a difference of 5 articles:\n\n1. **Option A ($8):**  \n   New price \\( x = 8 \\), original price \\( P = \\frac{8}{0.85} \\approx 9.412 \\).  \n   Number before: \\( \\frac{300}{9.412} \\approx 31.88 \\).  \n   Number after: \\( \\frac{300}{8} = 37.5 \\).  \n   Difference: \\( 37.5 - 31.88 = 5.62 \\) (not 5).\n\n2. **Option B ($10):**  \n   New price \\( x = 10 \\), original price \\( P = \\frac{10}{0.85} \\approx 11.765 \\).  \n   Number before: \\( \\frac{300}{11.765} \\approx 25.5 \\).  \n   Number after: \\( \\frac{300}{10} = 30 \\).  \n   Difference: \\( 30 - 25.5 = 4.5 \\) (not 5).\n\n3. **Option C ($13.6):**  \n   New price \\( x = 13.6 \\), original price \\( P = \\frac{13.6}{0.85} = 16 \\).  \n   Number before: \\( \\frac{300}{16} = 18.75 \\).  \n   Number after: \\( \\frac{300}{13.6} \\approx 22.05 \\).  \n   Difference: \\( 22.05 - 18.75 = 3.3 \\) (not 5).\n\n4. **Option D ($22.9):**  \n   New price \\( x = 22.9 \\), original price \\( P = \\frac{22.9}{0.85} \\approx 26.94 \\).  \n   Number before: \\( \\frac{300}{26.94} \\approx 11.13 \\).  \n   Number after: \\( \\frac{300}{22.9} \\approx 13.09 \\).  \n   Difference: \\( 13.09 - 11.13 = 1.96 \\) (not 5).\n\n5. **Option E ($40):**  \n   New price \\( x = 40 \\), original price \\( P = \\frac{40}{0.85} \\approx 47.06 \\).  \n   Number before: \\( \\frac{300}{47.06} \\approx 6.36 \\).  \n   Number after: \\( \\frac{300}{40} = 7.5 \\).  \n   Difference: \\( 7.5 - 6.36 = 1.14 \\) (not 5).\n\nNone of the options yield a difference of exactly 5 articles. However, the closest match is **Option A ($8)**, which gives a difference of 5.62 articles. Since $9 is not listed, and no option perfectly matches, the best available choice is:\n\n**Answer: B**",
