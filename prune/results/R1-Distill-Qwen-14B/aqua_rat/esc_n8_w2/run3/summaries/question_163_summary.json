      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about a man who spends 70% of his income. Then his income increases by 20%, and we need to find out what his new expenditure percentage is. The options are A to E, but I don't want to guess; I need to work it out.\n\nHmm, so first, let's break down the problem. The man currently spends 70% of his income. That means he saves the remaining 30%, right? Because 100% minus 70% is 30%. So if his income goes up by 20%, does his expenditure also increase, or does he keep the same absolute amount he was spending before? Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Oh, wait, no, the question is about the percentage of his new income that he spends. So his expenditure as a percentage of his income might change because his income has increased.\n\nWait, but does he change his spending? Like, does he start spending more in absolute terms, or does he keep the same amount and thus spends a lower percentage? Hmm, the question says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, but his expenditure also increases proportionally, then his spending percentage would stay the same. But that can't be the case here because the options don't have 70% as an answer. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Let's model it with numbers. Suppose his original income is, say, $100. Because using 100 makes percentages easy to calculate. So if his income is $100, he spends 70% of it, which is $70. Now, his income increases by 20%. So 20% of $100 is $20, so his new income is $120.\n\nBut wait, does his expenditure increase by the same 20%? Or does he adjust his spending based on the new income? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify whether his expenditure increases in absolute terms or remains the same. Wait, the way the question is phrased: \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" So I think it's asking what percentage of his new income he will spend, assuming he continues to spend the same absolute amount as before.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because if his income goes up but he keeps spending the same amount, his spending percentage would decrease. For example, if he was spending $70 out of $100, and his income becomes $120, then $70 is 70/120 which is about 58.33%. That would match option A. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe he continues to spend 70% of his new income, which would mean 70% of $120 is $84. But that's a different scenario.\n\nWait, the problem says he \"spends 70% of his income.\" So when his income changes, does his spending change proportionally, or is his spending fixed? I think the problem implies that he continues to spend the same percentage of his new income. So if his income goes up by 20%, his spending would also go up by 20%. So his new spending would be 70% of 120, which is 84. So as a percentage of his new income, it's 70%, same as before. But that doesn't make sense because the options don't include 70%. Hmm, so maybe I'm misinterpreting the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that his expenditure is fixed, so he continues to spend the same amount, but as a percentage of his new income, that percentage decreases. Let me go back to the example. Original income: $100, spends $70. Income increases by 20% to $120. If he continues to spend $70, then 70/120 is approximately 58.33%, which is option A. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but why would he change his spending? If his income goes up, why would he keep his expenditure the same? Maybe that's the assumption here. The question says, \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" It doesn't specify whether his spending increases or remains the same. Oh, but wait, the initial statement says he \"spends 70% of his income,\" which implies that the percentage is what defines his spending. So if his income increases, perhaps he continues to spend the same percentage. Then his new expenditure would be 70% of 120, which is 84, and 84/120 is 70% again. But none of the options are 70%, so that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is that his income increases, but his expenditure doesn't change. So he continues to spend the same amount, but as a percentage of his new income, it's lower.\n\nSo original income: $100, expenditure: $70. After 20% increase, income is $120. He still spends $70, so 70/120 = 58.333...%, which is 58.3%, matching option A.\n\nBut wait, why would he spend the same amount? Maybe the problem is that his expenditure increases in the same proportion as his income. So if income goes up by 20%, his spending also goes up by 20%. So his original spending was 70. 20% of 70 is 14, so new spending is 84. His new income is 120, so 84/120 is 70% again. That brings us back to the same percentage. But since the options don't include 70%, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his income increases, but his expenditure doesn't change. So the percentage of income spent goes down. But the problem states that he spends 70% of his income. So perhaps the way to model it is that the amount he spends is fixed, so as his income increases, the percentage spent decreases.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that he continues to spend the same absolute amount, so the percentage of income spent decreases. Let me model that.\n\nOriginal income: 100, spends 70. So if income increases by 20% to 120, he still spends 70, so 70/120 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut why would his expenditure not increase? Because the problem says he \"spends 70% of his income.\" So if his income increases, his spending would also increase proportionally. So perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous, but given the options, I think the intended approach is that his expenditure remains the same, so the percentage decreases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure remains a fixed amount, so the percentage decreases. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"A man spends 70% of his income.\" So if his income is I, he spends 0.7I. Then his income increases by 20%, so new income is I + 0.2I = 1.2I. So his new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I. So as a percentage of his new income, it's (0.84I)/(1.2I) = 0.7, which is 70%. But none of the options have 70%.\n\nHmm, that's confusing. So perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure remains the same as before the increase.\n\nIn that case, original income I, expenditure is 0.7I. After income increases by 20%, new income is 1.2I. Expenditure remains 0.7I.\n\nSo the new percentage is (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.7 / 1.2 \u2248 0.583333, which is 58.333%, so 58.3%, which is option A.\n\nSo I think that's the correct approach. The man's expenditure remains the same as a fixed amount, not a percentage of his income. Therefore, when his income increases, the percentage of his income that he spends decreases.\n\nSo the answer would be option A, 58.3%.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, what will be his new expenditure? The options are A to E, with some percentages.\n\nHmm, let me think. So initially, his income is, let's say, I. He spends 70% of that. So his expenditure is 0.7 * I. Now, his income increases by 20%. So the new income would be I plus 20% of I, which is I * 1.2.\n\nWait, but the question is about his new expenditure. I'm assuming that his expenditure is a fixed amount, not a percentage. Because if his income goes up and he spends a higher percentage, that would complicate things. Oh, wait, no, the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So the initial expenditure is 70% of I. Then, if his income goes up by 20%, his new income is 1.2I, and he still spends 70% of that.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" So, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, the initial spending is 70% of his income. So when his income changes, his expenditure as a percentage of the new income might change. Or does he keep the same absolute expenditure?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's take it step by step.\n\nLet me assign variables. Let initial income = I.\n\nExpenditure initially is 70% of I, so 0.7I.\n\nNow, income increases by 20%. So new income is I + 20% of I = 1.2I.\n\nAssuming that his expenditure increases by the same amount as his income, which is 20%, so his new expenditure would be 0.7I * 1.2. Wait, that's if both income and expenditure scale by the same factor.\n\nBut wait, that's not necessarily the case. Because the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of his new income.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me think again. Because the problem states that he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, the percentage he spends might stay the same or change? Oh, the question says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, the percentage he spends might stay the same, but the absolute amount would change. Wait, but the question is phrased as \"what will be his new expenditure?\"\u2014so it's unclear if it's a percentage or an absolute value.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the question says, \"what will be his new expenditure?\" The options are percentages. So it's asking what percentage of his new income does he spend.\n\nWait, no, no. Let me re-express the problem. Initially, he spends 70% of his income. So if his income is, say, $100, he spends $70. Now, his income increases by 20%, so it becomes $120. But does he now spend 70% of $120, which would be $84, so 70% again? Or does his expenditure increase by 20%, so $70 * 1.2 = $84, which is the same as 70% of $120. So in this case, the percentage remains the same.\n\nWait, but that's only if the increase in income and expenditure are both in absolute terms. So, if his income goes up by 20%, and his expenditure also goes up by 20%, then the percentage remains the same.\n\nBut wait, in reality, if his income increases, he might choose to spend the same percentage, or maybe more or less. But the problem doesn't specify that his spending habits change, only that his income increases. So perhaps his expenditure as a percentage of income remains the same.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense. Because in the problem, the initial expenditure is 70% of income. So if his income increases, and he continues to spend 70% of his income, his absolute expenditure increases, but the percentage remains 70%. So the new expenditure would be 70% of 1.2I.\n\nBut looking at the options, the answer isn't 70%, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income. Or perhaps it's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's take an example with numbers. Suppose his initial income is 100 units. He spends 70 units, which is 70% of 100. Now, his income increases by 20%, so new income is 120. If he continues to spend 70% of his income, his new expenditure is 70% of 120, which is 84. So 84 is what? As a percentage of the new income, it's 70%, but as a percentage of the original income (100), it's 84%.\n\nBut none of the options are 70 or 84. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a different percentage. Wait, but the question doesn't specify that; it only says his income increases, and asks what his new expenditure is.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases, and his expenditure as a percentage of income changes. Oh, but the problem states he spends 70% of his income, implying that this percentage is fixed.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the percentage of his new income, but about his absolute expenditure as a percentage of something else. Wait, that doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach it step by step.\n\nLet me model this with variables.\n\nLet initial income = I.\n\nInitial expenditure = 0.7 * I.\n\nAfter income increases by 20%, new income = I + 0.2I = 1.2I.\n\nAssuming that his expenditure as a percentage of income remains the same, his new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I. So his new expenditure is 84% of his original income.\n\nWait, but that's not directly an option. The options are in percentages, but I'm not sure what they're percentages of. The options are:\n\nA)58.3%\n\nB)62.5%\n\nC)63.5%\n\nD)64.5%\n\nE)65.5%\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income. But in that case, if he continues to spend 70% of his income, the percentage would remain 70%, which isn't an option. So perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps his expenditure is fixed, and we have to find what percentage of the new income that expenditure represents. Wait, that makes more sense.\n\nWait, that could be another interpretation. Let me think. Suppose his expenditure doesn't change in absolute terms, but his income increases, so his expenditure as a percentage of income decreases.\n\nWait, but the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, but he continues to spend the same percentage, his absolute expenditure increases. So in that case, the question is about his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income, which would be 70% again. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something here. Let's think again. Perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure increases by the same amount as his income's increase. So his income increases by 20%, so his expenditure also increases by 20%. So let's model that.\n\nInitial income: I.\n\nInitial expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nIncrease in income: 0.2I.\n\nIncrease in expenditure: 0.2 * initial expenditure = 0.2 * 0.7I = 0.14I.\n\nSo new expenditure = 0.7I + 0.14I = 0.84I.\n\nNow, what is this as a percentage of his new income, which is 1.2I.\n\nSo (0.84I) / (1.2I) = 0.84 / 1.2 = 0.7, which is 70%. Again, not an option.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when his income increases, his expenditure as a percentage of his income changes. Maybe he continues to spend the same absolute amount but as a percentage of his new, higher income, which would lower the percentage.\n\nWait, let me model that.\n\nInitial income: I.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7I.\n\nIf his income increases to 1.2I, but his expenditure remains 0.7I.\n\nThen, his new expenditure as a percentage of new income is (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.7 / 1.2 = 0.583333..., which is 58.333...%, so approximately 58.3%. That's option A.\n\nBut the problem says, \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" So if his expenditure remains the same (same absolute amount), then his new expenditure as a percentage of income would drop to 58.3%.\n\nBut wait, the problem states he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, but he continues to spend 70%, then his absolute expenditure would also increase. So the problem is a bit ambiguous in phrasing.\n\nBut given the options, 58.3% is an option (option A). But why would that be the case?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases, and his expenditure increases proportionally, so that the percentage of income spent remains the same.\n\nWait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So initial expenditure is 70% of income. If income increases by 20%, and he continues to spend 70%, then his absolute expenditure increases by 20% as well. So the new expenditure is 70% of 1.2I = 0.84I. So as a percentage of the new income, it's 70%, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 70%. So perhaps the question is not about the percentage of his income, but about something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases, and his expenditure also increases, but the percentage of his income that he spends remains the same. So the new percentage is the same as before.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the options don't have 70%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by a certain percentage, but the question is about what the new percentage is.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased as, his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure also increases by the same 20%. Then, what is the new percentage of his income that he spends.\n\nWait, let's model that.\n\nInitial income: I.\n\nInitial expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nExpenditure increases by 20%: 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I.\n\nNew income: 1.2I.\n\nSo new expenditure as a percentage of new income: (0.84I)/(1.2I) = 0.7, which is 70% again.\n\nHmm, not matching any options.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the absolute value of expenditure, not the percentage. But the options are percentages, so that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking what's the new percentage of expenditure relative to his original income. So, initial income I, new income 1.2I, new expenditure 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I. So as a percentage of original income, that's 84%, but that's not an option.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by a certain percentage, but the question is what is the new percentage of his income that he spends. But I'm getting stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when his income increases by 20%, his expenditure also increases by the same 20%, so the new expenditure is 70% of his original income plus 20% of that, which is 0.7I + 0.14I = 0.84I. So, as a percentage of his new income (1.2I), that's 0.84/1.2 = 0.7, so 70%.\n\nBut that's not an option, so perhaps I'm not interpreting the question correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure doesn't change. So, new expenditure is 0.7I, and new income is 1.2I. So the new percentage is (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.583333..., which is 58.3%, option A.\n\nBut the question says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, but he continues to spend 70% of it, his expenditure would increase as well. So why would the percentage drop to 58%? That would only happen if his expenditure remains the same as before.\n\nWait, but the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, he'll spend 70% of the new income, so his absolute expenditure increases, and the percentage remains 70%.\n\nSo why is 58.3% an option? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about his savings. But the question says 'expenditure', so that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his income increases, and his expenditure increases by a fixed amount, not a percentage. So for example, if his initial income is I, and he spends 0.7I, then when income increases to 1.2I, his expenditure increases by 20% of his original income, which is 0.2I. So new expenditure is 0.7I + 0.2I = 0.9I. Then, as a percentage of new income (1.2I), it's 0.9/1.2 = 0.75, which is 75%, not an option.\n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's assume the man's income is $100. So, he spends 70% of that, which is $70. Now, his income increases by 20%, so new income is $120. He still spends 70% of his income, so $84. Now, the question is, what's his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income? That would be 84/120 = 0.7, which is 70%, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 70%. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure only increases by 10%, so the percentage changes. But the problem doesn't specify that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure remains the same. So initial expenditure was $70, new income is $120. So new expenditure is 70/120 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut why would the problem state that he spends 70% of his income and then have his expenditure remain the same? That doesn't make sense, because if income increases, but expenditure remains the same, then the percentage spent would decrease.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if income increases, his expenditure should also increase, keeping the percentage at 70%. So why is 58.3% an option?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a fixed amount, not a percentage. Let's model that.\n\nLet initial income be I, initial expenditure is 0.7I.\n\nIf income increases by 20%, new income is 1.2I.\n\nExpenditure increases by a fixed amount, say, X. So new expenditure is 0.7I + X.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that, so I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20% of his original income, not his new income.\n\nSo, original expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nIncrease in expenditure: 0.2 * original income = 0.2I.\n\nSo new expenditure: 0.7I + 0.2I = 0.9I.\n\nNew income: 1.2I.\n\nSo new expenditure as a percentage of new income: (0.9I)/(1.2I) = 0.75 = 75%.\n\nNot an option.\n\nHmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me look for another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking what the new expenditure is, not as a percentage of income but as a percentage of the original income.\n\nWait, that's possible. So, initial expenditure is 70% of original income. After a 20% increase in income, the new expenditure is 70% of the new income.\n\nSo, new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I.\n\nSo, as a percentage of original income, 0.84I / I = 84%. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income, which is 70%, but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by a certain percentage, but the question is about the new expenditure as a percentage of his original income.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure decreases by a certain percentage, but that's not indicated in the question.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe man spends 70% of his income. So, if his income is I, his expenditure is 0.7I.\n\nHis income increases by 20%, so new income is 1.2I.\n\nAssuming his expenditure remains the same as a percentage of his income, his new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the new expenditure, which could be interpreted as a percentage of his new income. So 0.84I / 1.2I = 0.7, which is 70%, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure also increases by 20%, so new expenditure is 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I.\n\nBut then, as a percentage of his new income (1.2I), 0.84I/1.2I is 70% again.\n\nI'm not getting any of the options provided, which suggests I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased differently. Maybe the man spends 70% of his income on something, and the remaining 30% is saved or something. But the question is about his new expenditure after income increases by 20%.\n\nWait, perhaps the man's expenditure is fixed, but his income increases, so the percentage of his income that he spends decreases.\n\nBut in that case, the problem would state that his expenditure remains the same. But the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, he'll spend 70% of the new income.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that can't be. So I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases, and his expenditure is calculated as a percentage of the original income. Let me model that.\n\nNew income is 1.2I.\n\nExpenditure is 70% of new income: 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I.\n\nSo, as a percentage of original income, 0.84I / I = 84%, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a certain amount, and the question is what the new percentage is.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by the same amount as his income. So, if his income increases by 20%, so does his expenditure.\n\nLet me model that. Initial income I, expenditure 0.7I.\n\nIncome increases to 1.2I.\n\nExpenditure increases to 0.7I + 0.2I = 0.9I.\n\nSo new expenditure as a percentage of new income: 0.9I / 1.2I = 0.75 = 75%. Not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is about the proportion of income saved, but the question is about expenditure.\n\nWait, the man spends 70%, so he saves 30%. If his income increases, but he continues to save 30%, his expenditure would change.\n\nWait, but the problem says he spends 70% of his income, not that he saves a certain percentage. So that's probably not the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure remains the same, so the new percentage is lower. So, if his income was I, he spent 0.7I. Now, income is 1.2I, but expenditure is still 0.7I.\n\nSo, new expenditure as a percentage of new income is (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut why would his expenditure remain the same if his income increases? The problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income goes up, he would spend more, not the same amount.\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure is fixed, so when his income increases, the percentage spent decreases. So the answer would be 58.3%, option A.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which suggests that the percentage is fixed, not the absolute expenditure. So if his income increases, his absolute expenditure increases, keeping the percentage at 70%.\n\nBut then, why is 58.3% an option?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not that his income increases by 20%, but that his income increases such that his expenditure is 70% of the new income. Wait, that would be the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by a certain amount, leading to a new percentage.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a fixed amount, say, 20% of his original income, not his new income. So, new expenditure is 0.7I + 0.2I = 0.9I.\n\nNew income is 1.2I.\n\nSo new percentage is (0.9I)/(1.2I) = 0.75 = 75%, not an option.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by a fixed amount, say, 20% of his original expenditure. So, original expenditure is 0.7I. Increase is 0.2 * 0.7I = 0.14I. New expenditure is 0.7I + 0.14I = 0.84I.\n\nNew income is 1.2I.\n\nNew percentage: 0.84I /1.2I = 70%, which is not an option.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options are 58.3%, 62.5%, 63.5%, 64.5%, 65.5%.\n\nHmm, 58.3% is 7/12. So perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure is calculated as 70% of the original income plus 20% of the original expenditure.\n\nWait, that's getting too convoluted.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure is fixed, so the percentage spent is 70% of the original income over the new income.\n\nSo, 0.7I / 1.2I = 0.583333..., which is 58.3%, option A.\n\nBut why would the expenditure remain the same? The problem says he spends 70% of his income, implying that the percentage is fixed, not the absolute amount.\n\nSo, I think the correct approach is that when his income increases by 20%, his expenditure increases as 70% of the new income. So the percentage remains 70%, but that's not an option. Hence, perhaps the problem is that the question is about the expenditure as a percentage of the original income. So, 70% of 1.2I is 0.84I, which is 84% of the original income. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about his savings instead of expenditure. But the question clearly says 'expenditure'.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure only increases by 10%, so the percentage of income spent decreases. But the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let me think of the options again. The only option that matches my earlier calculation when expenditure remains the same is 58.3%, option A.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is A)58.3%.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a man who initially spends 70% of his income. When his income increases by 20%, the task is to determine his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income. \n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial Setup**:  \n   Let the initial income be \\( I \\). The man spends 70% of his income, so his initial expenditure is \\( 0.7I \\).\n\n2. **Income Increase**:  \n   The income increases by 20%, so the new income becomes \\( 1.2I \\).\n\n3. **Interpretation of Expenditure**:  \n   The problem is ambiguous about whether the expenditure remains fixed or continues to be 70% of the new income. Two interpretations are considered:\n   - **If the percentage of income spent remains constant**: The new expenditure would be \\( 0.7 \\times 1.2I = 0.84I \\). As a percentage of the new income (\\( 1.2I \\)), this is \\( \\frac{0.84I}{1.2I} = 0.7 \\), or 70%. However, 70% is not one of the options.\n   - **If the absolute expenditure remains fixed**: If the expenditure does not change and remains at \\( 0.7I \\), the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income is \\( \\frac{0.7I}{1.2I} = 0.5833 \\), or approximately 58.3%. This matches option **A**.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   Since the problem does not explicitly state whether the percentage of income spent remains constant, the interpretation that aligns with the provided options is that the absolute expenditure remains fixed. Thus, the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income is approximately 58.3%.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Answer: A**",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, what will be his new expenditure? The options are A to E, with some percentages.\n\nHmm, let me think. So initially, his income is, let's say, I. He spends 70% of that. So his expenditure is 0.7 * I. Now, his income increases by 20%. So the new income would be I plus 20% of I, which is I * 1.2.\n\nWait, but the question is about his new expenditure. I'm assuming that his expenditure is a fixed amount, not a percentage. Because if his income goes up and he spends a higher percentage, that would complicate things. Oh, wait, no, the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So the initial expenditure is 70% of I. Then, if his income goes up by 20%, his new income is 1.2I, and he still spends 70% of that.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" So, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, the initial spending is 70% of his income. So when his income changes, his expenditure as a percentage of the new income might change. Or does he keep the same absolute expenditure?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's take it step by step.\n\nLet me assign variables. Let initial income = I.\n\nExpenditure initially is 70% of I, so 0.7I.\n\nNow, income increases by 20%. So new income is I + 20% of I = 1.2I.\n\nAssuming that his expenditure increases by the same amount as his income, which is 20%, so his new expenditure would be 0.7I * 1.2. Wait, that's if both income and expenditure scale by the same factor.\n\nBut wait, that's not necessarily the case. Because the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of his new income.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me think again. Because the problem states that he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, the percentage he spends might stay the same or change? Oh, the question says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, the percentage he spends might stay the same, but the absolute amount would change. Wait, but the question is phrased as \"what will be his new expenditure?\"\u2014so it's unclear if it's a percentage or an absolute value.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the question says, \"what will be his new expenditure?\" The options are percentages. So it's asking what percentage of his new income does he spend.\n\nWait, no, no. Let me re-express the problem. Initially, he spends 70% of his income. So if his income is, say, $100, he spends $70. Now, his income increases by 20%, so it becomes $120. But does he now spend 70% of $120, which would be $84, so 70% again? Or does his expenditure increase by 20%, so $70 * 1.2 = $84, which is the same as 70% of $120. So in this case, the percentage remains the same.\n\nWait, but that's only if the increase in income and expenditure are both in absolute terms. So, if his income goes up by 20%, and his expenditure also goes up by 20%, then the percentage remains the same.\n\nBut wait, in reality, if his income increases, he might choose to spend the same percentage, or maybe more or less. But the problem doesn't specify that his spending habits change, only that his income increases. So perhaps his expenditure as a percentage of income remains the same.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense. Because in the problem, the initial expenditure is 70% of income. So if his income increases, and he continues to spend 70% of his income, his absolute expenditure increases, but the percentage remains 70%. So the new expenditure would be 70% of 1.2I.\n\nBut looking at the options, the answer isn't 70%, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income. Or perhaps it's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's take an example with numbers. Suppose his initial income is 100 units. He spends 70 units, which is 70% of 100. Now, his income increases by 20%, so new income is 120. If he continues to spend 70% of his income, his new expenditure is 70% of 120, which is 84. So 84 is what? As a percentage of the new income, it's 70%, but as a percentage of the original income (100), it's 84%.\n\nBut none of the options are 70 or 84. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a different percentage. Wait, but the question doesn't specify that; it only says his income increases, and asks what his new expenditure is.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases, and his expenditure as a percentage of income changes. Oh, but the problem states he spends 70% of his income, implying that this percentage is fixed.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the percentage of his new income, but about his absolute expenditure as a percentage of something else. Wait, that doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach it step by step.\n\nLet me model this with variables.\n\nLet initial income = I.\n\nInitial expenditure = 0.7 * I.\n\nAfter income increases by 20%, new income = I + 0.2I = 1.2I.\n\nAssuming that his expenditure as a percentage of income remains the same, his new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I. So his new expenditure is 84% of his original income.\n\nWait, but that's not directly an option. The options are in percentages, but I'm not sure what they're percentages of. The options are:\n\nA)58.3%\n\nB)62.5%\n\nC)63.5%\n\nD)64.5%\n\nE)65.5%\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income. But in that case, if he continues to spend 70% of his income, the percentage would remain 70%, which isn't an option. So perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps his expenditure is fixed, and we have to find what percentage of the new income that expenditure represents. Wait, that makes more sense.\n\nWait, that could be another interpretation. Let me think. Suppose his expenditure doesn't change in absolute terms, but his income increases, so his expenditure as a percentage of income decreases.\n\nWait, but the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, but he continues to spend the same percentage, his absolute expenditure increases. So in that case, the question is about his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income, which would be 70% again. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something here. Let's think again. Perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure increases by the same amount as his income's increase. So his income increases by 20%, so his expenditure also increases by 20%. So let's model that.\n\nInitial income: I.\n\nInitial expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nIncrease in income: 0.2I.\n\nIncrease in expenditure: 0.2 * initial expenditure = 0.2 * 0.7I = 0.14I.\n\nSo new expenditure = 0.7I + 0.14I = 0.84I.\n\nNow, what is this as a percentage of his new income, which is 1.2I.\n\nSo (0.84I) / (1.2I) = 0.84 / 1.2 = 0.7, which is 70%. Again, not an option.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when his income increases, his expenditure as a percentage of his income changes. Maybe he continues to spend the same absolute amount but as a percentage of his new, higher income, which would lower the percentage.\n\nWait, let me model that.\n\nInitial income: I.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7I.\n\nIf his income increases to 1.2I, but his expenditure remains 0.7I.\n\nThen, his new expenditure as a percentage of new income is (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.7 / 1.2 = 0.583333..., which is 58.333...%, so approximately 58.3%. That's option A.\n\nBut the problem says, \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" So if his expenditure remains the same (same absolute amount), then his new expenditure as a percentage of income would drop to 58.3%.\n\nBut wait, the problem states he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, but he continues to spend 70%, then his absolute expenditure would also increase. So the problem is a bit ambiguous in phrasing.\n\nBut given the options, 58.3% is an option (option A). But why would that be the case?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases, and his expenditure increases proportionally, so that the percentage of income spent remains the same.\n\nWait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So initial expenditure is 70% of income. If income increases by 20%, and he continues to spend 70%, then his absolute expenditure increases by 20% as well. So the new expenditure is 70% of 1.2I = 0.84I. So as a percentage of the new income, it's 70%, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 70%. So perhaps the question is not about the percentage of his income, but about something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases, and his expenditure also increases, but the percentage of his income that he spends remains the same. So the new percentage is the same as before.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the options don't have 70%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by a certain percentage, but the question is about what the new percentage is.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased as, his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure also increases by the same 20%. Then, what is the new percentage of his income that he spends.\n\nWait, let's model that.\n\nInitial income: I.\n\nInitial expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nExpenditure increases by 20%: 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I.\n\nNew income: 1.2I.\n\nSo new expenditure as a percentage of new income: (0.84I)/(1.2I) = 0.7, which is 70% again.\n\nHmm, not matching any options.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the absolute value of expenditure, not the percentage. But the options are percentages, so that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking what's the new percentage of expenditure relative to his original income. So, initial income I, new income 1.2I, new expenditure 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I. So as a percentage of original income, that's 84%, but that's not an option.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by a certain percentage, but the question is what is the new percentage of his income that he spends. But I'm getting stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when his income increases by 20%, his expenditure also increases by the same 20%, so the new expenditure is 70% of his original income plus 20% of that, which is 0.7I + 0.14I = 0.84I. So, as a percentage of his new income (1.2I), that's 0.84/1.2 = 0.7, so 70%.\n\nBut that's not an option, so perhaps I'm not interpreting the question correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure doesn't change. So, new expenditure is 0.7I, and new income is 1.2I. So the new percentage is (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 0.583333..., which is 58.3%, option A.\n\nBut the question says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, but he continues to spend 70% of it, his expenditure would increase as well. So why would the percentage drop to 58%? That would only happen if his expenditure remains the same as before.\n\nWait, but the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, he'll spend 70% of the new income, so his absolute expenditure increases, and the percentage remains 70%.\n\nSo why is 58.3% an option? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about his savings. But the question says 'expenditure', so that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his income increases, and his expenditure increases by a fixed amount, not a percentage. So for example, if his initial income is I, and he spends 0.7I, then when income increases to 1.2I, his expenditure increases by 20% of his original income, which is 0.2I. So new expenditure is 0.7I + 0.2I = 0.9I. Then, as a percentage of new income (1.2I), it's 0.9/1.2 = 0.75, which is 75%, not an option.\n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's assume the man's income is $100. So, he spends 70% of that, which is $70. Now, his income increases by 20%, so new income is $120. He still spends 70% of his income, so $84. Now, the question is, what's his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income? That would be 84/120 = 0.7, which is 70%, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 70%. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure only increases by 10%, so the percentage changes. But the problem doesn't specify that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure remains the same. So initial expenditure was $70, new income is $120. So new expenditure is 70/120 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut why would the problem state that he spends 70% of his income and then have his expenditure remain the same? That doesn't make sense, because if income increases, but expenditure remains the same, then the percentage spent would decrease.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if income increases, his expenditure should also increase, keeping the percentage at 70%. So why is 58.3% an option?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a fixed amount, not a percentage. Let's model that.\n\nLet initial income be I, initial expenditure is 0.7I.\n\nIf income increases by 20%, new income is 1.2I.\n\nExpenditure increases by a fixed amount, say, X. So new expenditure is 0.7I + X.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that, so I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by 20% of his original income, not his new income.\n\nSo, original expenditure: 0.7I.\n\nIncrease in expenditure: 0.2 * original income = 0.2I.\n\nSo new expenditure: 0.7I + 0.2I = 0.9I.\n\nNew income: 1.2I.\n\nSo new expenditure as a percentage of new income: (0.9I)/(1.2I) = 0.75 = 75%.\n\nNot an option.\n\nHmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me look for another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking what the new expenditure is, not as a percentage of income but as a percentage of the original income.\n\nWait, that's possible. So, initial expenditure is 70% of original income. After a 20% increase in income, the new expenditure is 70% of the new income.\n\nSo, new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I.\n\nSo, as a percentage of original income, 0.84I / I = 84%. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income, which is 70%, but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by a certain percentage, but the question is about the new expenditure as a percentage of his original income.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure decreases by a certain percentage, but that's not indicated in the question.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe man spends 70% of his income. So, if his income is I, his expenditure is 0.7I.\n\nHis income increases by 20%, so new income is 1.2I.\n\nAssuming his expenditure remains the same as a percentage of his income, his new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the new expenditure, which could be interpreted as a percentage of his new income. So 0.84I / 1.2I = 0.7, which is 70%, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure also increases by 20%, so new expenditure is 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I.\n\nBut then, as a percentage of his new income (1.2I), 0.84I/1.2I is 70% again.\n\nI'm not getting any of the options provided, which suggests I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased differently. Maybe the man spends 70% of his income on something, and the remaining 30% is saved or something. But the question is about his new expenditure after income increases by 20%.\n\nWait, perhaps the man's expenditure is fixed, but his income increases, so the percentage of his income that he spends decreases.\n\nBut in that case, the problem would state that his expenditure remains the same. But the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, he'll spend 70% of the new income.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that can't be. So I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases, and his expenditure is calculated as a percentage of the original income. Let me model that.\n\nNew income is 1.2I.\n\nExpenditure is 70% of new income: 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I.\n\nSo, as a percentage of original income, 0.84I / I = 84%, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a certain amount, and the question is what the new percentage is.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by the same amount as his income. So, if his income increases by 20%, so does his expenditure.\n\nLet me model that. Initial income I, expenditure 0.7I.\n\nIncome increases to 1.2I.\n\nExpenditure increases to 0.7I + 0.2I = 0.9I.\n\nSo new expenditure as a percentage of new income: 0.9I / 1.2I = 0.75 = 75%. Not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is about the proportion of income saved, but the question is about expenditure.\n\nWait, the man spends 70%, so he saves 30%. If his income increases, but he continues to save 30%, his expenditure would change.\n\nWait, but the problem says he spends 70% of his income, not that he saves a certain percentage. So that's probably not the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure remains the same, so the new percentage is lower. So, if his income was I, he spent 0.7I. Now, income is 1.2I, but expenditure is still 0.7I.\n\nSo, new expenditure as a percentage of new income is (0.7I)/(1.2I) = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut why would his expenditure remain the same if his income increases? The problem says he spends 70% of his income. So if his income goes up, he would spend more, not the same amount.\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure is fixed, so when his income increases, the percentage spent decreases. So the answer would be 58.3%, option A.\n\nBut the problem says he spends 70% of his income, which suggests that the percentage is fixed, not the absolute expenditure. So if his income increases, his absolute expenditure increases, keeping the percentage at 70%.\n\nBut then, why is 58.3% an option?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not that his income increases by 20%, but that his income increases such that his expenditure is 70% of the new income. Wait, that would be the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by a certain amount, leading to a new percentage.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a fixed amount, say, 20% of his original income, not his new income. So, new expenditure is 0.7I + 0.2I = 0.9I.\n\nNew income is 1.2I.\n\nSo new percentage is (0.9I)/(1.2I) = 0.75 = 75%, not an option.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by a fixed amount, say, 20% of his original expenditure. So, original expenditure is 0.7I. Increase is 0.2 * 0.7I = 0.14I. New expenditure is 0.7I + 0.14I = 0.84I.\n\nNew income is 1.2I.\n\nNew percentage: 0.84I /1.2I = 70%, which is not an option.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options are 58.3%, 62.5%, 63.5%, 64.5%, 65.5%.\n\nHmm, 58.3% is 7/12. So perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure is calculated as 70% of the original income plus 20% of the original expenditure.\n\nWait, that's getting too convoluted.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, and his expenditure is fixed, so the percentage spent is 70% of the original income over the new income.\n\nSo, 0.7I / 1.2I = 0.583333..., which is 58.3%, option A.\n\nBut why would the expenditure remain the same? The problem says he spends 70% of his income, implying that the percentage is fixed, not the absolute amount.\n\nSo, I think the correct approach is that when his income increases by 20%, his expenditure increases as 70% of the new income. So the percentage remains 70%, but that's not an option. Hence, perhaps the problem is that the question is about the expenditure as a percentage of the original income. So, 70% of 1.2I is 0.84I, which is 84% of the original income. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about his savings instead of expenditure. But the question clearly says 'expenditure'.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's income increases by 20%, but his expenditure only increases by 10%, so the percentage of income spent decreases. But the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let me think of the options again. The only option that matches my earlier calculation when expenditure remains the same is 58.3%, option A.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is A)58.3%.\n\n\nThe problem involves a man who initially spends 70% of his income. When his income increases by 20%, the task is to determine his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income. \n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial Setup**:  \n   Let the initial income be \\( I \\). The man spends 70% of his income, so his initial expenditure is \\( 0.7I \\).\n\n2. **Income Increase**:  \n   The income increases by 20%, so the new income becomes \\( 1.2I \\).\n\n3. **Interpretation of Expenditure**:  \n   The problem is ambiguous about whether the expenditure remains fixed or continues to be 70% of the new income. Two interpretations are considered:\n   - **If the percentage of income spent remains constant**: The new expenditure would be \\( 0.7 \\times 1.2I = 0.84I \\). As a percentage of the new income (\\( 1.2I \\)), this is \\( \\frac{0.84I}{1.2I} = 0.7 \\), or 70%. However, 70% is not one of the options.\n   - **If the absolute expenditure remains fixed**: If the expenditure does not change and remains at \\( 0.7I \\), the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income is \\( \\frac{0.7I}{1.2I} = 0.5833 \\), or approximately 58.3%. This matches option **A**.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   Since the problem does not explicitly state whether the percentage of income spent remains constant, the interpretation that aligns with the provided options is that the absolute expenditure remains fixed. Thus, the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income is approximately 58.3%.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Answer: A**",
