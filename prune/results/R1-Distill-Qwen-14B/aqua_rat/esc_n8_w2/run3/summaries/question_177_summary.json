      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this multiplication problem here, and I need to figure out what the digits are based on the given table. Hmm, let me look at it carefully.\n\nThe multiplication is set up like a standard grid. The multiplicand is a three-digit number, M A D, and the multiplier is a two-digit number, B E. When they multiply, the result is a four-digit number, A M I D. Oh wait, no, looking again, the first partial product is M A D, the second is R A E, and then the total is A M I D. So it's like a standard multiplication where each digit of the multiplier multiplies the multiplicand, and then the results are added.\n\nLet me write this out to visualize better. So:\n\n   M A D\n\u00d7  B E\n-------\n    M A D   (this must be D \u00d7 MAD, since it's the units place multiplication)\n  R A E     (this must be E \u00d7 MAD, shifted one position to the left)\n-------\n  A M I D   (the sum of the partial products)\n\nWait, no, actually, in standard multiplication, the second partial product would be shifted left by one, so the first partial product is E \u00d7 MAD, and the second is B \u00d7 MAD shifted left by one (times ten). Oh wait, maybe I have it reversed. Let me think: in multiplication, the first line is the units digit multiplier (E) multiplied by MAD, giving a partial product. Then the second line is the tens digit (B) multiplied by MAD, but shifted one position to the left, so it's B \u00d7 MAD \u00d7 10. So the two partial products are:\n\nE \u00d7 MAD \u2192 first partial product (maybe written as MAD, but that depends on the digits)\nB \u00d7 MAD \u2192 second partial product, written as R A E shifted left by one.\n\nWait, but in the multiplication setup, the partial products are written as:\n\n   MAD\n\u00d7  BE\n------\n   MAD (this is E \u00d7 MAD)\n RAE  (this is B \u00d7 MAD, shifted left by one, so when written, it's RAE but in the next line)\n------\nAMID\n\nWait, but when you add MAD and RAE shifted left (so RAE0?), you get AMID. Hmm, but the sum is a four-digit number, so AMID must be the total.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Let me write it out as a multiplication:\n\nMAD\n\u00d7 BE\n------\n   MAD \u00d7 E \u2192 this is the first partial product, which is MAD \u00d7 E. If E is 0, then it would be 000, but in this case, the first partial product is MAD, so perhaps E is 1? Because any number multiplied by 1 is itself. So if E is 1, then the first partial product is MAD.\n\nThen the second partial product is MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one. So it's B \u00d7 MAD, written as RAE but shifted left by one, so the second line would be RAE0, but in the problem, it's written as RAE. Wait, no, the way the multiplication is written, the second partial product is RAE, but placed one position to the left, so in the sum, it's RAE0 (if it's a three-digit number shifted left by one, it's a four-digit number). But when added to MAD, which is a three-digit number, it results in a four-digit number AMID.\n\nWait, let me think numerically. Let me assign variables to the digits. Let me represent each letter as a digit.\n\nSo:\n\nMAD is a three-digit number: 100*M + 10*A + D.\n\nBE is a two-digit number: 10*B + E.\n\nThe multiplication is MAD \u00d7 BE = AMID.\n\nBreaking down the multiplication:\n\nFirst, E \u00d7 MAD = a three-digit number. Wait, but in the partial product, it's written as MAD. So that implies E \u00d7 MAD = MAD. Which can only happen if E is 1. Because when you multiply a number by 1, you get the same number. So E must be 1.\n\nSo E = 1.\n\nThen, the first partial product is MAD \u00d7 1 = MAD. That makes sense.\n\nThe second partial product is B \u00d7 MAD, shifted left by one (i.e., multiplied by 10). So the second partial product is (B \u00d7 MAD) \u00d7 10, which is written as R A E in the problem. Wait, but RAE is a three-digit number, but when shifted left by one, it becomes R A E 0, a four-digit number. Wait, no. Wait, in the multiplication, the second partial product is written as R A E but shifted left, so in the addition, it's R A E shifted left by one, which is R A E 0, but that's four digits. But the sum is a four-digit number AMID. So perhaps the second partial product is a three-digit number, but when shifted left, it's four digits. Let me think: if B \u00d7 MAD is a three-digit number, then R A E would be that three-digit number, but when shifted left, it becomes R A E 0. So the sum would be MAD + R A E 0 = AMID.\n\nBut wait, MAD is a three-digit number, R A E 0 is a four-digit number, so adding them would be:\n\n   MAD (three digits)\n+ RAE0 (four digits)\n= AMID (four digits)\n\nSo that would make sense. So the second partial product is RAE0, a four-digit number. But in the multiplication setup, the second partial product is written as RAE, which is a three-digit number. So R A E is the second partial product (B \u00d7 MAD), and when shifted left, it's R A E 0.\n\nSo the multiplication looks like:\n\n      MAD\n    \u00d7  BE\n    -------\n        MAD (E=1)\n      RAE0 (B \u00d7 MAD \u00d7 10)\n    -------\n      AMID\n\nSo adding MAD and RAE0 gives AMID.\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\nMAD + RAE0 = AMID.\n\nWait, but in terms of numbers, that would be:\n\n(100*M + 10*A + D) + (1000*R + 100*A + 10*E + 0) = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nWait, but E is 1, so substituting E=1, the equation becomes:\n\n(100M +10A + D) + (1000R + 100A + 10*1 + 0) = 1000A + 100M + 10I + D.\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\n100M + 10A + D + 1000R + 100A + 10 = 100M + 110A + D + 1000R +10.\n\nThis equals the right side: 1000A + 100M + 10I + D.\n\nSo, equate both sides:\n\n100M + 110A + D + 1000R +10 = 1000A + 100M +10I + D.\n\nSubtracting terms:\n\n100M cancels on both sides. D cancels as well.\n\nSo left with:\n\n110A + 1000R +10 = 1000A + 10I.\n\nRearranging:\n\n1000R +10 = 1000A -110A +10I.\n\nSimplify 1000A -110A = 890A.\n\nSo,\n\n1000R +10 = 890A +10I.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me see if I can find another equation or constraints.\n\nAnother thought: Since R A E is the product of B \u00d7 MAD, and E is 1, so R A E is B \u00d7 MAD. But wait, no, R A E is B \u00d7 MAD without the shift. So R A E is (B \u00d7 MAD) as a three-digit number, and when shifted left, it's R A E 0, which is four digits.\n\nWait, but B \u00d7 MAD is R A E. Since B is a single digit (as BE is a two-digit number), and MAD is a three-digit number, R A E must be a three-digit number. So B \u00d7 MAD is a three-digit number.\n\nSo, R A E = B \u00d7 MAD.\n\nBut wait, that can't be, because MAD is a three-digit number, and B is a single digit, so their product can be up to 9 \u00d7 999 = 8991, which is four digits. But R A E is a three-digit number, so B \u00d7 MAD must be a three-digit number.\n\nThus, B \u00d7 MAD must be between 100 and 999.\n\nSo, B is between 1 and 9, and MAD is between 100 and 999. So, 100 \u2264 B \u00d7 MAD \u2264 999.\n\nBut since B is a single digit, the maximum value of B is 9, so MAD must be \u2264 999 / B. For example, if B=1, MAD can be up to 999. If B=2, MAD can be up to 499, and so on.\n\nBut this might not directly help. Let's think about the sum.\n\nThe sum is MAD + RAE0 = AMID.\n\nWhich is:\n\n(100M +10A + D) + (1000R +100A + 10*1 + 0) = 1000A + 100M +10I + D.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, rearranged:\n\n1000R +10 = 890A +10I.\n\nDividing both sides by 10:\n\n100R +1 = 89A + I.\n\nHmm, that's a simpler equation: 100R +1 =89A + I.\n\nNow, A, R, I are digits (0-9), but A can't be zero because it's the leading digit of a four-digit number AMID. So A is at least 1.\n\nLooking at the equation, 100R +1 =89A + I.\n\nSince 100R must be less than or equal to 89A + I. But since I is a single digit (0-9), 89A + I can be up to 89*9 +9=810 +9=819.\n\nSo 100R +1 \u2264819 \u2192 100R \u2264818 \u2192 R \u22648.18 \u2192 R can be up to 8.\n\nBut R is a digit, so R can be from 0 to 8.\n\nAlso, since R is the first digit of the partial product R A E, which is a three-digit number, R cannot be zero. So R is between 1 and 8.\n\nSo possible R values: 1-8.\n\nLet me think about possible A values.\n\nLet's consider R=8. Then 100*8 +1 =801. So 801=89A + I.\n\nWe have 89A \u2264801 \u2192 A \u2264801/89 \u22489. So A can be 9. Then 89*9=801, so I would be 0. So that's possible.\n\nSo if R=8, A=9, I=0.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nEquation: 100*8 +1 =801=89*9 +0 \u2192 801=801. Yes, correct.\n\nAnother possibility: R=7.\n\nThen 701=89A + I.\n\nSo 89A must be \u2264701 \u2192 A\u2264701/89\u22487.876 \u2192 A=7.\n\n89*7=623. So 701-623=78. But I is a single digit, so 78 is not possible. So R=7 is not possible.\n\nR=6 \u2192 601=89A + I.\n\n89A \u2264601 \u2192 A \u2264601/89 \u22486.75 \u2192 A=6.\n\n89*6=534 \u2192 I=601-534=67. No, I can't be 67. So invalid.\n\nR=5 \u2192 501=89A +I.\n\nA\u2264501/89\u22485.62 \u2192 A=5.\n\n89*5=445. I=501-445=56. Not possible.\n\nR=4 \u2192401=89A +I.\n\nA\u2264401/89\u22484.5 \u2192 A=4.\n\n89*4=356 \u2192 I=401-356=45. No.\n\nR=3 \u2192301=89A +I.\n\nA\u2264301/89\u22483.38 \u2192 A=3.\n\n89*3=267 \u2192 I=301-267=34. No.\n\nR=2 \u2192201=89A +I.\n\nA\u2264201/89\u22482.258 \u2192 A=2.\n\n89*2=178 \u2192 I=201-178=23. No.\n\nR=1 \u2192101=89A +I.\n\nA\u2264101/89\u22481.13 \u2192 A=1.\n\n89*1=89 \u2192 I=101-89=12. No.\n\nSo the only possible solution is R=8, A=9, I=0.\n\nSo A=9, R=8, I=0.\n\nNow, let's see what that gives us.\n\nSo E=1, A=9.\n\nNow, the first partial product is MAD \u00d71 = MAD.\n\nThe second partial product is B \u00d7 MAD = R A E = R A E \u2192 R=8, A=9, E=1. So R A E is 8 9 1, which is 891.\n\nSo B \u00d7 MAD =891.\n\nBut B is a single digit, so B must be a divisor of 891.\n\nLet me factor 891 to find possible B values.\n\n891 \u00f7 9 = 99 \u2192 9 \u00d799=891. So B=9, MAD=99.\n\nWait, but MAD is a three-digit number. 99 is two digits. So that's not possible. So B can't be 9.\n\nWait, perhaps B=3. Let's check: 891 \u00f73 = 297. So MAD=297. Which is a three-digit number. So possible.\n\nAlternatively, 891 \u00f7 1=891 \u2192 MAD=891, but B would be 1. But let's check if that's possible.\n\nWait, if B=1, then BE is 11. So MAD \u00d711 = AMID.\n\nWait, let me think. Let's see what's possible.\n\nWait, the options given are for the digits M, A, D, I. Let me see.\n\nWait, from our earlier deduction, A is 9, I is 0, E is 1, R is8.\n\nSo the four-digit number is AMID= 9 M 0 D.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sum is A M I D, which is a four-digit number. Since A=9, it's 9 M 0 D.\n\nWait, no, the sum is AMID, which is 1000A + 100M + 10I + D. So A=9, I=0, so it's 9 M 0 D.\n\nBut earlier, from the sum equation, we have that when we add MAD and RAE0, we get 9 M 0 D.\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\nMAD (three digits) + RAE0 (four digits) = 9 M 0 D.\n\nBut let's think about the addition:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n   MAD\n+ RAE0\n= 9M0D\n\nBut RAE is 891, so RAE0 is 8910.\n\nSo the sum is MAD + 8910 = 9M0D.\n\nSo, MAD is a three-digit number, 9M0D is a four-digit number. So 9M0D is between 1000 and 9999.\n\nSo, MAD must be between (1000 - 8910) which is negative, which can't be, so that can't be right. Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, RAE0 is 8910, which is a four-digit number. So adding MAD (a three-digit number) to 8910 (four-digit) gives a four-digit number 9M0D.\n\nSo, 8910 + MAD = 9M0D.\n\nSo, 9M0D is a four-digit number starting with 9. So 9M0D is between 9000 and 9999.\n\nSo, 8910 + MAD = 9000 + (M*100) + 0*10 + D.\n\nWhich implies MAD = 9000 + M*100 + D - 8910.\n\nSimplify: MAD = (9000 - 8910) + M*100 + D \u2192 90 + M*100 + D.\n\nSo, MAD = M*100 + D +90.\n\nBut MAD is a three-digit number, which is 100*M + 10*A + D.\n\nSince A=9, MAD = 100*M + 90 + D.\n\nSo,\n\n100*M +90 + D = M*100 + D +90 \u2192 which is the same on both sides. So this doesn't give any new information.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the sum numerically.\n\nSum is 8910 + MAD = 9M0D.\n\nSo, 8910 + (100M + 90 + D) = 9000 + 100M + 0*10 + D.\n\nWait, let me compute left side:\n\n8910 + 100M +90 + D = 100M + 8910 +90 + D = 100M + 9000 + D.\n\nRight side is 9000 + 100M + D.\n\nSo, both sides are equal. So this doesn't help. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the multiplication of B \u00d7 MAD =891.\n\nBecause R A E is 891, which is B \u00d7 MAD.\n\nSo, B \u00d7 MAD =891.\n\nBut MAD is a three-digit number, so MAD= 891 / B.\n\nSince B is a digit (1-9), let's find which B divides 891 and gives a three-digit MAD.\n\n891 \u00f7 B must be a three-digit integer.\n\nPossible B:\n\nLet me check B=3 \u2192 891 \u00f73=297. So MAD=297.\n\nB=9 \u2192 891 \u00f79=99. But 99 is two-digit, so invalid.\n\nB=1 \u2192 891. MAD=891. So possible.\n\nB= 2 \u2192 891/2=445.5 \u2192 not integer.\n\nB= 3 \u2192297.\n\nB= 6 \u2192891/6=148.5 \u2192 no.\n\nB= 7 \u2192 891/7\u2248127.285 \u2192 no.\n\nB= 9 \u219299, which is two-digit, so no.\n\nSo possible B values are 1 and 3.\n\nCase 1: B=1 \u2192 MAD=891.\n\nSo, BE would be 11 (since B=1, E=1).\n\nThen, the multiplication would be 891 \u00d7 11 = ?\n\nLet me compute that: 891 \u00d711 = 9801.\n\nSo, the result should be AMID=9801.\n\nWhich would make A=9, M=8, I=0, D=1.\n\nSo, checking the letters:\n\nM=8, A=9, D=1.\n\nSo the digits would be:\n\nM=8, A=9, D=1.\n\nBE=11.\n\nSo the sum of the partial products would be:\n\nFirst partial product: 891 \u00d71=891 \u2192 written as MAD=891, which matches.\n\nSecond partial product: 891 \u00d71 (since B=1) \u2192 but shifted left by one, so 8910.\n\nAdding 891 + 8910 = 9801 \u2192 AMID=9801.\n\nSo A=9, M=8, I=0, D=1.\n\nSo the digits are M=8, A=9, D=1.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, let me see what the options are. The options are given as four-digit numbers, each representing M, A, D, I.\n\nWait, the question is to decipher the multiplication table, which gives the digits M, A, D, I. The options are:\n\nA)9 2 0 0\n\nB)9 2 0 9\n\nC)9 2 0 1\n\nD)9 2 0 7\n\nE)9 2 2 2\n\nWait, but according to this case, M=8, A=9, D=1, I=0. So the digits are 8,9,1,0. But the options have A as 9, M as 2 in all options except for option A which is 9 2 0 0, etc. Wait, no, the options are four-digit numbers, but they are labeled as options A to E, each with four digits.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=0. No, wait, no, I think the options are for M, A, D, I. So each option gives the four digits in order M, A, D, I.\n\nWait, the question says, \"Decipher the following multiplication table: ... Options: A)9 2 0 0 etc.\"\n\nSo each option is a four-digit number where the digits are M, A, D, I in that order.\n\nWait, no, the options are:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=0.\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=9.\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=1.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=7.\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=2, I=2.\n\nWait, but in our case, M=8, A=9, D=1, I=0. So none of the options match that. Because the options have M=9 and A=2, which is conflicting with our deduction where A=9.\n\nSo perhaps this case is not possible. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nIn the first case, B=1, MAD=891, BE=11, product=9801.\n\nSo the four-digit number is AMID=9801.\n\nSo A=9, M=8, I=0, D=1.\n\nThus, the digits are M=8, A=9, D=1, I=0.\n\nLooking at the options, none match this. Because all options have M=9 and A=2. So perhaps this case is not the right path.\n\nLet me check the other case where B=3.\n\nCase 2: B=3 \u2192 MAD=891/3=297.\n\nSo MAD=297 \u2192 M=2, A=9, D=7.\n\nBE is 31 (since B=3, E=1).\n\nSo, let's compute MAD \u00d7 BE = 297 \u00d731.\n\n297 \u00d731: Let's compute.\n\n297 \u00d730 = 8910.\n\n297 \u00d71=297.\n\nAdding 8910 +297=9207.\n\nSo the product is 9207.\n\nWhich would be AMID=9207.\n\nSo A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7.\n\nSo digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D is 9 2 0 7 \u2192 which is M=9, A=2, D=0, I=7. No, that's not matching.\n\nWait, our digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nSo in the options, which one has M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 M=9, A=2. No.\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 M=9, A=2. No.\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 M=9, A=2. No.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 M=9, A=2. No.\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 M=9, A=2. No.\n\nWait, none of the options match this scenario. Hmm.\n\nSo perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me think about the partial products.\n\nWait, another approach: let's consider the first partial product is MAD \u00d7 E = MAD. So E must be 1, as we thought earlier.\n\nSo E=1.\n\nThe second partial product is B \u00d7 MAD, which is R A E. So B \u00d7 MAD = R A 1.\n\nBecause E is 1.\n\nSo R A E is R A 1.\n\nSo R A 1 = B \u00d7 MAD.\n\nBut MAD is a three-digit number, so B \u00d7 MAD is R A 1.\n\nSo, let's think about the multiplication:\n\nMAD \u00d7 B = R A 1.\n\nSo, R A 1 is a three-digit number.\n\nSo, B \u00d7 MAD is a three-digit number ending with 1.\n\nSo, the units digit of B \u00d7 D must be 1.\n\nBecause when you multiply B \u00d7 D, the units digit is 1.\n\nSo, possible pairs for B and D:\n\nLooking for B \u00d7 D \u22611 mod 10.\n\nPossible options:\n\nB=1 \u2192 D=1.\n\nB=3 \u2192 D=7 (since 3\u00d77=21 \u2192 1 in units place).\n\nB=7 \u2192 D=3 (7\u00d73=21).\n\nB=9 \u2192 D=9 (9\u00d79=81).\n\nSo possible (B,D) pairs: (1,1), (3,7), (7,3), (9,9).\n\nNow, let's go through each possibility.\n\nCase 1: B=1, D=1.\n\nThen, R A 1 =1 \u00d7 MAD = MAD.\n\nSo MAD = R A 1.\n\nBut MAD is a three-digit number, so R would be M, A would be A, and 1 is D.\n\nWhich is consistent, but let's check.\n\nThen, the sum is MAD + RAE0 = MAD + (MAD) shifted left (since B=1, RAE= MAD).\n\nSo sum is MAD + MAD \u00d710 = MAD \u00d711.\n\nWhich must equal AMID.\n\nSo, MAD \u00d711 = AMID.\n\nLet me think about what MAD \u00d711 would look like.\n\nMultiplying a three-digit number by 11:\n\nFor example, 234 \u00d711 = 2574.\n\nSo, the result is a four-digit number where the thousands digit is the same as the hundreds digit of MAD, and the hundreds digit is the sum of the hundreds and tens digits of MAD, etc.\n\nBut in this case, the product is AMID, which is a four-digit number.\n\nSo, let's model MAD \u00d711 = AMID.\n\nMAD is 100M +10A + D.\n\nSo, 11*(100M +10A + D) = 1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nWait, let me compute 11*(MAD):\n\n11*(100M +10A + D) = 1100M + 110A +11D.\n\nWhich should equal 1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nSo,\n\n1100M +110A +11D =1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nRearranging terms:\n\n1100M -100M +110A -1000A +11D - D =10I.\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000M -890A +10D =10I.\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n100M -89A + D = I.\n\nSo, I = 100M -89A + D.\n\nBut I is a single digit (0-9), so 100M -89A + D must be between 0 and 9.\n\nGiven that M and A are digits (M can be 1-9, A 0-9), let's see possible values.\n\nWe also know that in this case, B=1, D=1.\n\nSo, D=1.\n\nSo, I=100M -89A +1.\n\nAnd I must be between 0 and 9.\n\nSo,\n\n0 \u2264 100M -89A +1 \u22649.\n\nWhich implies:\n\n-1 \u2264 100M -89A \u22648.\n\nBut 100M is at least 100 (since M\u22651), and 89A can be up to 801 (if A=9).\n\nSo, 100M -89A \u2265100 - 801 = -701.\n\nBut for I to be non-negative, 100M -89A +1 \u22650 \u2192 100M -89A \u2265-1.\n\nBut 100M -89A must be \u22648, because I \u22649 \u2192 100M -89A +1 \u22649 \u2192 100M -89A \u22648.\n\nSo, 100M -89A must be between -1 and 8.\n\nBut 100M is positive, and 89A can be up to 801.\n\nHmm, let's see possible M and A values.\n\nM is at least 1.\n\nLet me try M=1:\n\nI=100*1 -89A +1 =101-89A.\n\nWe need 101 -89A \u22648 \u2192 89A \u226593 \u2192 A\u22651 (since 89*1=89 <93, so A must be \u22652.\n\nWait, 89A \u226593 \u2192 A \u2265 93/89 \u22481.04 \u2192 so A \u22652.\n\nBut for A=2:\n\nI=101-89*2=101-178= -77 \u2192 invalid, since I can't be negative.\n\nSo no solution for M=1.\n\nM=2:\n\nI=200 -89A +1=201 -89A.\n\nWe need 201 -89A \u22648 \u219289A \u2265193 \u2192 A\u2265193/89\u22482.168 \u2192 A=3.\n\nCheck A=3:\n\nI=201-267= -66 \u2192 invalid.\n\nA=2: I=201-178=23 \u2192 invalid.\n\nNo solution.\n\nM=3:\n\nI=300-89A +1=301-89A.\n\n301-89A \u22648 \u219289A \u2265293 \u2192 A\u22653.3 \u2192 A=4.\n\nA=4 \u2192 I=301-356= -55 \u2192 invalid.\n\nA=3 \u2192 I=301-267=34 \u2192 invalid.\n\nM=4:\n\nI=401-89A.\n\n401-89A \u22648 \u219289A\u2265393 \u2192A\u22654.416 \u2192A=5.\n\nA=5 \u2192 I=401-445= -44 \u2192 invalid.\n\nA=4 \u2192 I=401-356=45 \u2192 invalid.\n\nM=5:\n\nI=501-89A.\n\n501-89A \u22648 \u219289A \u2265493 \u2192A\u22655.54 \u2192 A=6.\n\nA=6 \u2192 I=501-534= -33 \u2192 invalid.\n\nA=5 \u2192 I=501-445=56 \u2192 invalid.\n\nM=6:\n\nI=601-89A.\n\n601-89A \u22648 \u219289A\u2265593 \u2192A\u22656.66 \u2192A=7.\n\nA=7 \u2192 I=601-623= -22 \u2192 invalid.\n\nA=6 \u2192 I=601-534=67 \u2192 invalid.\n\nM=7:\n\nI=701-89A.\n\n701-89A \u22648 \u219289A\u2265693 \u2192A\u22657.786 \u2192A=8.\n\nA=8 \u2192 I=701-712= -11 \u2192 invalid.\n\nA=7 \u2192 I=701-623=78 \u2192 invalid.\n\nM=8:\n\nI=801-89A.\n\n801-89A \u22648 \u219289A\u2265793 \u2192A\u22658.898 \u2192A=9.\n\nA=9 \u2192 I=801-801=0 \u2192 valid.\n\nSo, M=8, A=9, I=0.\n\nSo, this gives:\n\nM=8, A=9, D=1 (from earlier case), I=0.\n\nSo, digits are M=8, A=9, D=1, I=0.\n\nSo, AMID=9 8 0 1.\n\nBut the options don't have this. The options have M=9 and A=2. So perhaps this case isn't possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nIn this case, B=1 and D=1.\n\nSo, the product is MAD \u00d7 11 = AMID.\n\nWith M=8, A=9, D=1, I=0.\n\nSo, the product is 891 \u00d711=9801.\n\nWhich matches. So AMID=9801.\n\nBut in the options, none have M=8, A=9, D=1, I=0. So perhaps this isn't the correct path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the other possibilities for B and D.\n\nLet's try another case.\n\nCase 2: B=3, D=7.\n\nSo, R A 1 =3 \u00d7 MAD.\n\nMAD is a three-digit number, so 3 \u00d7 MAD is a three-digit number R A 1.\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 MAD = R A 1.\n\nAlso, in this case, the sum is MAD + RAE0 = AMID.\n\nWhere R A E is R A 1.\n\nSo, R A 1 =3 \u00d7 MAD.\n\nSo, R A 1 is 3 \u00d7 MAD.\n\nSo, MAD must be such that when multiplied by 3, the result is R A 1, a three-digit number ending with 1.\n\nSo, MAD must be a number such that 3 \u00d7 MAD ends with 1.\n\nWhich implies that D \u00d73 ends with 1. Since D=7, 7 \u00d73=21 \u2192 ends with 1. So that's correct.\n\nSo, let's find MAD such that 3 \u00d7 MAD is R A 1.\n\nLet me express MAD as 100M +10A +7.\n\n3*(100M +10A +7) = 300M +30A +21.\n\nBut this equals 100R +10A +1.\n\nSo,\n\n300M +30A +21 = 100R +10A +1.\n\nRearranging:\n\n300M +30A +21 -10A -1 = 100R \u2192 300M +20A +20 = 100R.\n\nDivide both sides by 20:\n\n15M + A +1 =5R.\n\nSo,\n\n5R =15M + A +1.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n5R =15M +A +1.\n\nSince R is a digit (1-9), 5R must be between 5 and 45.\n\nSo,\n\n15M +A +1 \u226445.\n\nBut M is a digit (1-9).\n\nLet me see possible M values.\n\nM can be 1, 2, or 3, because 15*3=45, so 15M +A +1 \u226445.\n\nM=1:\n\n5R=15*1 +A +1 \u21925R=16 +A.\n\nA is a digit (0-9), so 16+A must be divisible by 5.\n\nPossible A values:\n\n16+A must be 20 or 25 (since 16+4=20, 16+9=25).\n\nSo A=4 \u2192 16+4=20 \u2192 R=4.\n\nOr A=9 \u219216+9=25 \u2192 R=5.\n\nSo possible pairs:\n\nM=1, A=4, R=4.\n\nOr M=1, A=9, R=5.\n\nLet me check each.\n\nSubcase 2a: M=1, A=4, R=4.\n\nSo, MAD=147 (since M=1, A=4, D=7).\n\nCheck 3 \u00d7147=441.\n\nWhich is R A 1 \u2192 R=4, A=4, which matches.\n\nSo R=4, A=4. But earlier in this case, A=4, but in this subcase, A is 4, but earlier in this case, the A was supposed to be 9. Wait, no, in this case, A is a variable. Wait, no, in this case, A is 4.\n\nWait, in this scenario, A=4, so the four-digit product is AMID=4 M I 7.\n\nWait, no, AMID is A M I D.\n\nWait, in this case, A=4, M=1, I is to be determined, D=7.\n\nSo, the sum is MAD + RAE0 =147 + R A 1 \u00d710 \u2192 R A 1 is 441, so RAE0=4410.\n\nSo, 147 +4410=4557.\n\nSo, AMID=4557.\n\nWhich is A=4, M=5, I=5, D=7.\n\nBut wait, in our subcase, M was 1. So that doesn't match. Because M is 1, but in the product, it's 4557, which has M=5. So this is a conflict.\n\nHmm, perhaps this subcase isn't valid.\n\nSubcase 2b: M=1, A=9, R=5.\n\nSo, MAD=197.\n\n3 \u00d7197=591.\n\nSo R A 1=591 \u2192 R=5, A=9, which matches.\n\nSo, R=5, A=9.\n\nNow, the sum is MAD + RAE0 =197 +5910=6107.\n\nSo, AMID=6107.\n\nWhich would be A=6, M=1, I=0, D=7.\n\nBut in this subcase, A=9, but the product has A=6. So conflict.\n\nThus, this subcase isn't valid.\n\nM=2:\n\n5R=15*2 +A +1 \u21925R=30 +A +1=31+A.\n\n31+A must be divisible by 5.\n\nSo 31+A \u22610 mod5 \u2192 A \u2261-31 mod5 \u2192 -31 mod5 is 4, because 31/5=6*5=30, 31-30=1 \u2192 31 mod5=1 \u2192 -31 mod5=4.\n\nSo A must be 4 or 9 (since 4 and 9 are the digits where A mod5=4).\n\nSo, A=4 or 9.\n\nSubcase 2c: M=2, A=4.\n\nThen, 5R=31+4=35 \u2192 R=7.\n\nSo, MAD=247.\n\n3 \u00d7247=741.\n\nWhich is R A 1=741 \u2192 R=7, A=4, which matches.\n\nSum is MAD + RAE0 =247 +7410=7657.\n\nAMID=7657 \u2192 A=7, M=6, I=5, D=7.\n\nBut in this subcase, A=4, but the product has A=7. So conflict.\n\nSubcase 2d: M=2, A=9.\n\n5R=31+9=40 \u2192 R=8.\n\nSo, MAD=297.\n\n3\u00d7297=891.\n\nWhich is R A 1=891 \u2192 R=8, A=9, which matches.\n\nSum is 297 +8910=9207.\n\nAMID=9207 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7.\n\nWhich matches our subcase variables: A=9, M=2, D=7, I=0.\n\nSo the digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nLooking at the options, the option D is 9 2 0 7, which would correspond to M=9, A=2, D=0, I=7. No, that's not matching.\n\nWait, the digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0. So the four-digit number is 9207. So the digits are A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 9 2 0 7 \u2192 which is A=9, M=2, D=0, I=7. Wait, but D is 7, not 0. So no match.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the sum again.\n\nSum is MAD + RAE0 =297 +8910=9207.\n\nYes, so AMID=9207 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7.\n\nSo, the four-digit number is 9207.\n\nSo, the digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nLooking at the options, none of them have M=2 and A=9. The options all have M=9 and A=2.\n\nSo perhaps this case is not the right path.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the earlier assumption. Let me think.\n\nWait, the sum is AMID=9207.\n\nWhich is A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7.\n\nSo, the digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nLooking back at the options, the options are for M, A, D, I.\n\nSo, the digits would be M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nSo, the four-digit number is 2 9 7 0. But the options don't have this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check another case.\n\nCase 3: B=7, D=3.\n\nSo, R A 1=7 \u00d7 MAD.\n\nSo, 7 \u00d7 MAD must end with 1. Since D=3, 3\u00d77=21 \u2192 ends with 1.\n\nSo, let's find MAD such that 7 \u00d7 MAD is R A 1.\n\nMAD=100M +10A +3.\n\n7*(100M +10A +3) =700M +70A +21.\n\nThis should equal 100R +10A +1.\n\nSo,\n\n700M +70A +21 =100R +10A +1.\n\nRearranging:\n\n700M +70A +21 -10A -1 =100R \u2192700M +60A +20=100R.\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n70M +6A +2 =10R.\n\nWhich implies:\n\n10R =70M +6A +2.\n\nSince R is a digit (1-9), 10R must be between 10 and 90.\n\nSo,\n\n70M +6A +2 \u226490.\n\n70M \u226490-6A-2 \u219270M \u226488-6A.\n\nBut M is at least 1.\n\n70*1=70 \u226488-6A \u21926A \u226418 \u2192A \u22643.\n\nSo A can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nLet's try M=1:\n\nThen,\n\n10R=70*1 +6A +2=72 +6A.\n\nSo, 10R=72+6A.\n\nSince R must be an integer, 72+6A must be divisible by 10.\n\nSo, 72 +6A \u22610 mod10 \u2192 72 mod10=2 \u2192 2 +6A mod10=0 \u21926A mod10=8.\n\nSo, 6A \u22618 mod10.\n\nLooking for A (0-3) where 6A mod10=8.\n\nA= 0 \u21920 \u2192 no.\n\nA=1 \u21926 \u2192 no.\n\nA=2 \u219212 mod10=2 \u2192 no.\n\nA=3 \u219218 mod10=8 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo, A=3.\n\nSo, R= (72+6*3)/10 \u2192 (72+18)/10=90/10=9.\n\nSo, R=9.\n\nSo, MAD=133 (M=1, A=3, D=3).\n\nWait, wait, D is 3 in this case.\n\nSo, MAD=133.\n\nCheck 7 \u00d7133=931.\n\nWhich is R A 1=931 \u2192 R=9, A=3, which matches.\n\nNow, the sum is MAD + RAE0 =133 +9310=9443.\n\nSo, AMID=9443 \u2192 A=9, M=4, I=4, D=3.\n\nBut in our subcase, A=3, which conflicts with the product's A=9.\n\nSo, this is invalid.\n\nM=1 is not possible.\n\nM=0 is not possible because MAD is a three-digit number.\n\nSo, M must be \u22651.\n\nWait, perhaps M=0 is allowed? No, because MAD is a three-digit number, M can't be zero.\n\nSo, no solution in this case.\n\nCase 4: B=9, D=9.\n\nSo, R A 1=9 \u00d7 MAD.\n\nSince D=9, 9 \u00d79=81 \u2192 ends with 1.\n\nSo, 9 \u00d7 MAD must end with 1.\n\nSo, MAD must be such that 9 \u00d7 MAD ends with 1.\n\nWhich implies that D \u00d79 ends with 1. D=9 \u21929 \u00d79=81 \u2192 ends with 1. So that's correct.\n\nSo, 9 \u00d7 MAD = R A 1.\n\nLet me write MAD as 100M +10A +9.\n\n9*(100M +10A +9) =900M +90A +81.\n\nThis equals 100R +10A +1.\n\nSo,\n\n900M +90A +81 =100R +10A +1.\n\nRearranging:\n\n900M +90A +81 -10A -1 =100R \u2192900M +80A +80 =100R.\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n90M +8A +8 =10R.\n\nSo,\n\n10R=90M +8A +8.\n\nSince R is a digit (1-9), 10R must be between 10 and 90.\n\nSo,\n\n90M +8A +8 \u226490.\n\n90M \u226490 -8A -8 \u219290M \u226482 -8A.\n\nSince M is at least 1:\n\n90*1=90 \u226482-8A \u21928A \u2264-8 \u2192A \u2264-1.\n\nBut A is a digit (0-9), so no solution in this case.\n\nThus, B=9 is invalid.\n\nSo, from all the cases, the only possible valid solution is when B=3 and D=7, leading to AMID=9207, with M=2, A=9, I=0, D=7.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps.\n\nWait, let me go back to the initial assumption.\n\nWait, the sum is MAD + RAE0 = AMID.\n\nWhich is (100M +10A + D) + (1000R +100A +10E +0) =1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nBut E=1.\n\nSo, substituting E=1:\n\n(100M +10A + D) + (1000R +100A +10) =1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nSimplify:\n\n100M +10A + D +1000R +100A +10 =1000A +100M +10I +D.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(100M +100M) \u2192 200M? Wait, no, the right side has 100M.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nLeft side:\n\n100M +10A + D +1000R +100A +10 = 100M + (10A +100A) + D +1000R +10 =100M +110A + D +1000R +10.\n\nRight side:\n\n1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nSo,\n\n100M +110A + D +1000R +10 =1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nSubtract 100M and D from both sides:\n\n110A +1000R +10 =1000A +10I.\n\nRearranged:\n\n1000R +10 =890A +10I.\n\nDivide by 10:\n\n100R +1 =89A + I.\n\nWhich we did earlier.\n\nSo, in this case, the only solution is R=8, A=9, I=0.\n\nSo, the digits are A=9, R=8, I=0.\n\nSo, the four-digit product is 9 M 0 D.\n\nAnd the sum is MAD + RAE0 =9 M 0 D.\n\nWe have R=8, so RAE is 891.\n\nSo, RAE0=8910.\n\nSo, MAD +8910=9 M 0 D.\n\nSo, MAD=9 M 0 D -8910.\n\nBut MAD is a three-digit number.\n\nSo, 9 M 0 D is a four-digit number starting with 9, so it's between 9000 and 9999.\n\nSo, MAD= (9000 + M*100 +0*10 + D) -8910.\n\nSimplify:\n\nMAD=9000 +100M +D -8910=90 +100M +D.\n\nBut MAD is also equal to 100M +10A +D.\n\nSince A=9, MAD=100M +90 +D.\n\nSo,\n\n100M +90 +D=90 +100M +D \u2192 which is the same on both sides. So, no new information.\n\nBut we can find D from the fact that B \u00d7 MAD = RAE=891.\n\nSo, B \u00d7 MAD=891.\n\nAnd B is a single digit, so B must be a divisor of 891.\n\nFactors of 891: 891= 3^3 \u00d7 33, etc. Let me list the possible B values.\n\n891 \u00f79=99 \u2192 B=9, MAD=99 \u2192 but MAD is three-digit, so invalid.\n\n891 \u00f73=297 \u2192 B=3, MAD=297.\n\nSo, B=3, MAD=297.\n\nSo, MAD=297 \u2192 M=2, A=9, D=7.\n\nSo, the digits are M=2, A=9, D=7.\n\nThe sum is MAD + RAE0=297 +8910=9207 \u2192 AMID=9207.\n\nSo, A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7.\n\nSo, the four-digit number is 9207.\n\nThus, the digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nLooking at the options, none match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption that E=1 is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nIn the multiplication, the first partial product is E \u00d7 MAD = MAD.\n\nSo, E \u00d7 MAD = MAD.\n\nWhich implies E=1, since MAD \u00d71 = MAD.\n\nSo, E must be 1.\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the only valid solution is AMID=9207, with M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nBut the options don't have this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=0.\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=9.\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=1.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=7.\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=2, I=2.\n\nWait, in all options, M=9, A=2.\n\nBut according to our solution, M=2, A=9.\n\nSo perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the setup is different.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the partial products.\n\nWait, perhaps the second partial product is not RAE shifted left by one, but rather, it's shifted left by one digit, so RAE becomes RAE0, but written as R A E in the multiplication, but when shifted, it's RAE0.\n\nBut in the problem, the multiplication is shown as:\n\n   MAD\n\u00d7  BE\n-------\n    MAD\n  RAE\n-------\n  AMID\n\nSo, the second partial product is RAE, but in reality, it's RAE shifted left by one, making it RAE0.\n\nSo, when adding MAD and RAE0, we get AMID.\n\nSo, the sum is MAD + RAE0 = AMID.\n\nWhich is:\n\n(100M +10A + D) + (1000R + 100A + 10E + 0) =1000A + 100M + 10I + D.\n\nBut E=1.\n\nSo,\n\n100M +10A + D +1000R +100A +10 =1000A +100M +10I +D.\n\nSimplify:\n\n100M +110A + D +1000R +10 =1000A +100M +10I +D.\n\nCancel terms:\n\n110A +1000R +10 =1000A +10I.\n\nRearranged:\n\n1000R +10 =890A +10I.\n\nDivide by 10:\n\n100R +1=89A +I.\n\nWhich leads us to R=8, A=9, I=0.\n\nSo, the digits are A=9, R=8, I=0.\n\nSo, the sum is MAD + RAE0= AMID=9 M 0 D.\n\nSo, MAD= (9000 + M*100 + D) -8910.\n\nWhich is 90 +100M + D.\n\nBut MAD is also 100M +90 + D.\n\nSo, same as before.\n\nSo, the only possible B is 3, leading to MAD=297.\n\nThus, the digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option D)9 2 0 7.\n\nWait, option D is 9 2 0 7 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=7.\n\nBut according to our solution, M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nSo, this doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial product setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the second partial product is R A E, but not shifted, so the sum is MAD + RAE \u00d710 = AMID.\n\nWhich is:\n\n(100M +10A + D) + (1000R +100A +10E) = 1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nBut E=1.\n\nSo,\n\n100M +10A + D +1000R +100A +10 =1000A +100M +10I +D.\n\nSimplify:\n\n100M +110A + D +1000R +10 =1000A +100M +10I +D.\n\nCancel 100M and D:\n\n110A +1000R +10 =1000A +10I.\n\nRearranged:\n\n1000R +10 =890A +10I.\n\nDivide by 10:\n\n100R +1=89A +I.\n\nWhich is the same equation.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the solution is M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option D)9 2 0 7.\n\nWait, because in that case, M=9, A=2, D=0, I=7.\n\nBut that would mean the sum is AMID=2907.\n\nWait, let me compute.\n\nIf M=9, A=2, D=0, I=7.\n\nThen, MAD=920.\n\nBE is B E.\n\nThe partial products would be:\n\nE \u00d7920 =920 \u00d7E.\n\nWhich should be the first partial product.\n\nThe second partial product is B \u00d7920, shifted left by one.\n\nSum is 920 \u00d7 BE =2907.\n\nWait, 920 \u00d7 BE=2907.\n\nBut 2907 \u00f7920 \u22483.16, which is not an integer. So BE would be a two-digit number, but 920 \u00d73=2760, which is less than 2907.\n\nSo, this can't be correct.\n\nThus, perhaps the correct answer is option D)9 2 0 7.\n\nBut according to the calculations, the correct digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0, which isn't among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves deciphering a multiplication table where the multiplicand is a three-digit number **MAD**, the multiplier is a two-digit number **BE**, and the product is a four-digit number **AMID**. The multiplication setup is as follows:\n\n```\n   MAD\n\u00d7  BE\n-------\n    MAD   (E \u00d7 MAD)\n  RAE    (B \u00d7 MAD, shifted left by one)\n-------\n  AMID\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **E = 1**: The first partial product is **MAD**, which implies that multiplying **MAD** by **E** results in **MAD** itself. This is only possible if **E = 1**.\n\n2. **Second Partial Product**: The second partial product is **RAE**, which represents **B \u00d7 MAD**. Since **RAE** is a three-digit number, **B \u00d7 MAD** must also be a three-digit number. This constrains **B** to a single digit (1-9) and **MAD** to a three-digit number.\n\n3. **Sum of Partial Products**: The sum of the partial products (**MAD + RAE0**) equals the final product **AMID**. This gives the equation:\n   \\[\n   (100M + 10A + D) + (1000R + 100A + 10E) = 1000A + 100M + 10I + D\n   \\]\n   Substituting **E = 1**, this simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   100M + 110A + D + 1000R + 10 = 1000A + 100M + 10I + D\n   \\]\n   Canceling terms and rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   1000R + 10 = 890A + 10I\n   \\]\n   Dividing by 10:\n   \\[\n   100R + 1 = 89A + I\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for R, A, I**: The equation \\(100R + 1 = 89A + I\\) must hold, where \\(R, A, I\\) are digits (0-9). Testing possible values:\n   - For \\(R = 8\\), \\(100(8) + 1 = 801\\), which gives \\(89A + I = 801\\). Solving this:\n     - \\(A = 9\\), \\(I = 0\\) (since \\(89 \\times 9 = 801\\), leaving \\(I = 0\\)).\n\n5. **Determining M and D**:\n   - From the second partial product, \\(B \\times MAD = RAE = 891\\). Since \\(B\\) is a single digit, \\(B = 3\\) and \\(MAD = 891 / 3 = 297\\).\n   - Thus, \\(M = 2\\), \\(A = 9\\), \\(D = 7\\).\n\n6. **Final Product**: The sum of the partial products is:\n   \\[\n   MAD + RAE0 = 297 + 8910 = 9207\n   \\]\n   This matches the four-digit product \\(AMID = 9207\\), confirming \\(A = 9\\), \\(M = 2\\), \\(I = 0\\), \\(D = 7\\).\n\n### Matching with Options:\nThe digits are \\(M = 2\\), \\(A = 9\\), \\(D = 7\\), \\(I = 0\\). However, none of the options directly match this combination. The closest option is **D) 9 2 0 7**, which corresponds to \\(M = 9\\), \\(A = 2\\), \\(D = 0\\), \\(I = 7\\). While this does not perfectly align with the derived digits, it is the most plausible choice given the options.\n\nANSWER: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this multiplication problem here, and I need to figure out what the digits are based on the given table. Hmm, let me look at it carefully.\n\nThe multiplication is set up like a standard grid. The multiplicand is a three-digit number, M A D, and the multiplier is a two-digit number, B E. When they multiply, the result is a four-digit number, A M I D. Oh wait, no, looking again, the first partial product is M A D, the second is R A E, and then the total is A M I D. So it's like a standard multiplication where each digit of the multiplier multiplies the multiplicand, and then the results are added.\n\nLet me write this out to visualize better. So:\n\n   M A D\n\u00d7  B E\n-------\n    M A D   (this must be D \u00d7 MAD, since it's the units place multiplication)\n  R A E     (this must be E \u00d7 MAD, shifted one position to the left)\n-------\n  A M I D   (the sum of the partial products)\n\nWait, no, actually, in standard multiplication, the second partial product would be shifted left by one, so the first partial product is E \u00d7 MAD, and the second is B \u00d7 MAD shifted left by one (times ten). Oh wait, maybe I have it reversed. Let me think: in multiplication, the first line is the units digit multiplier (E) multiplied by MAD, giving a partial product. Then the second line is the tens digit (B) multiplied by MAD, but shifted one position to the left, so it's B \u00d7 MAD \u00d7 10. So the two partial products are:\n\nE \u00d7 MAD \u2192 first partial product (maybe written as MAD, but that depends on the digits)\nB \u00d7 MAD \u2192 second partial product, written as R A E shifted left by one.\n\nWait, but in the multiplication setup, the partial products are written as:\n\n   MAD\n\u00d7  BE\n------\n   MAD (this is E \u00d7 MAD)\n RAE  (this is B \u00d7 MAD, shifted left by one, so when written, it's RAE but in the next line)\n------\nAMID\n\nWait, but when you add MAD and RAE shifted left (so RAE0?), you get AMID. Hmm, but the sum is a four-digit number, so AMID must be the total.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Let me write it out as a multiplication:\n\nMAD\n\u00d7 BE\n------\n   MAD \u00d7 E \u2192 this is the first partial product, which is MAD \u00d7 E. If E is 0, then it would be 000, but in this case, the first partial product is MAD, so perhaps E is 1? Because any number multiplied by 1 is itself. So if E is 1, then the first partial product is MAD.\n\nThen the second partial product is MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one. So it's B \u00d7 MAD, written as RAE but shifted left by one, so the second line would be RAE0, but in the problem, it's written as RAE. Wait, no, the way the multiplication is written, the second partial product is RAE, but placed one position to the left, so in the sum, it's RAE0 (if it's a three-digit number shifted left by one, it's a four-digit number). But when added to MAD, which is a three-digit number, it results in a four-digit number AMID.\n\nWait, let me think numerically. Let me assign variables to the digits. Let me represent each letter as a digit.\n\nSo:\n\nMAD is a three-digit number: 100*M + 10*A + D.\n\nBE is a two-digit number: 10*B + E.\n\nThe multiplication is MAD \u00d7 BE = AMID.\n\nBreaking down the multiplication:\n\nFirst, E \u00d7 MAD = a three-digit number. Wait, but in the partial product, it's written as MAD. So that implies E \u00d7 MAD = MAD. Which can only happen if E is 1. Because when you multiply a number by 1, you get the same number. So E must be 1.\n\nSo E = 1.\n\nThen, the first partial product is MAD \u00d7 1 = MAD. That makes sense.\n\nThe second partial product is B \u00d7 MAD, shifted left by one (i.e., multiplied by 10). So the second partial product is (B \u00d7 MAD) \u00d7 10, which is written as R A E in the problem. Wait, but RAE is a three-digit number, but when shifted left by one, it becomes R A E 0, a four-digit number. Wait, no. Wait, in the multiplication, the second partial product is written as R A E but shifted left, so in the addition, it's R A E shifted left by one, which is R A E 0, but that's four digits. But the sum is a four-digit number AMID. So perhaps the second partial product is a three-digit number, but when shifted left, it's four digits. Let me think: if B \u00d7 MAD is a three-digit number, then R A E would be that three-digit number, but when shifted left, it becomes R A E 0. So the sum would be MAD + R A E 0 = AMID.\n\nBut wait, MAD is a three-digit number, R A E 0 is a four-digit number, so adding them would be:\n\n   MAD (three digits)\n+ RAE0 (four digits)\n= AMID (four digits)\n\nSo that would make sense. So the second partial product is RAE0, a four-digit number. But in the multiplication setup, the second partial product is written as RAE, which is a three-digit number. So R A E is the second partial product (B \u00d7 MAD), and when shifted left, it's R A E 0.\n\nSo the multiplication looks like:\n\n      MAD\n    \u00d7  BE\n    -------\n        MAD (E=1)\n      RAE0 (B \u00d7 MAD \u00d7 10)\n    -------\n      AMID\n\nSo adding MAD and RAE0 gives AMID.\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\nMAD + RAE0 = AMID.\n\nWait, but in terms of numbers, that would be:\n\n(100*M + 10*A + D) + (1000*R + 100*A + 10*E + 0) = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nWait, but E is 1, so substituting E=1, the equation becomes:\n\n(100M +10A + D) + (1000R + 100A + 10*1 + 0) = 1000A + 100M + 10I + D.\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\n100M + 10A + D + 1000R + 100A + 10 = 100M + 110A + D + 1000R +10.\n\nThis equals the right side: 1000A + 100M + 10I + D.\n\nSo, equate both sides:\n\n100M + 110A + D + 1000R +10 = 1000A + 100M +10I + D.\n\nSubtracting terms:\n\n100M cancels on both sides. D cancels as well.\n\nSo left with:\n\n110A + 1000R +10 = 1000A + 10I.\n\nRearranging:\n\n1000R +10 = 1000A -110A +10I.\n\nSimplify 1000A -110A = 890A.\n\nSo,\n\n1000R +10 = 890A +10I.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me see if I can find another equation or constraints.\n\nAnother thought: Since R A E is the product of B \u00d7 MAD, and E is 1, so R A E is B \u00d7 MAD. But wait, no, R A E is B \u00d7 MAD without the shift. So R A E is (B \u00d7 MAD) as a three-digit number, and when shifted left, it's R A E 0, which is four digits.\n\nWait, but B \u00d7 MAD is R A E. Since B is a single digit (as BE is a two-digit number), and MAD is a three-digit number, R A E must be a three-digit number. So B \u00d7 MAD is a three-digit number.\n\nSo, R A E = B \u00d7 MAD.\n\nBut wait, that can't be, because MAD is a three-digit number, and B is a single digit, so their product can be up to 9 \u00d7 999 = 8991, which is four digits. But R A E is a three-digit number, so B \u00d7 MAD must be a three-digit number.\n\nThus, B \u00d7 MAD must be between 100 and 999.\n\nSo, B is between 1 and 9, and MAD is between 100 and 999. So, 100 \u2264 B \u00d7 MAD \u2264 999.\n\nBut since B is a single digit, the maximum value of B is 9, so MAD must be \u2264 999 / B. For example, if B=1, MAD can be up to 999. If B=2, MAD can be up to 499, and so on.\n\nBut this might not directly help. Let's think about the sum.\n\nThe sum is MAD + RAE0 = AMID.\n\nWhich is:\n\n(100M +10A + D) + (1000R +100A + 10*1 + 0) = 1000A + 100M +10I + D.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, rearranged:\n\n1000R +10 = 890A +10I.\n\nDividing both sides by 10:\n\n100R +1 = 89A + I.\n\nHmm, that's a simpler equation: 100R +1 =89A + I.\n\nNow, A, R, I are digits (0-9), but A can't be zero because it's the leading digit of a four-digit number AMID. So A is at least 1.\n\nLooking at the equation, 100R +1 =89A + I.\n\nSince 100R must be less than or equal to 89A + I. But since I is a single digit (0-9), 89A + I can be up to 89*9 +9=810 +9=819.\n\nSo 100R +1 \u2264819 \u2192 100R \u2264818 \u2192 R \u22648.18 \u2192 R can be up to 8.\n\nBut R is a digit, so R can be from 0 to 8.\n\nAlso, since R is the first digit of the partial product R A E, which is a three-digit number, R cannot be zero. So R is between 1 and 8.\n\nSo possible R values: 1-8.\n\nLet me think about possible A values.\n\nLet's consider R=8. Then 100*8 +1 =801. So 801=89A + I.\n\nWe have 89A \u2264801 \u2192 A \u2264801/89 \u22489. So A can be 9. Then 89*9=801, so I would be 0. So that's possible.\n\nSo if R=8, A=9, I=0.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nEquation: 100*8 +1 =801=89*9 +0 \u2192 801=801. Yes, correct.\n\nAnother possibility: R=7.\n\nThen 701=89A + I.\n\nSo 89A must be \u2264701 \u2192 A\u2264701/89\u22487.876 \u2192 A=7.\n\n89*7=623. So 701-623=78. But I is a single digit, so 78 is not possible. So R=7 is not possible.\n\nR=6 \u2192 601=89A + I.\n\n89A \u2264601 \u2192 A \u2264601/89 \u22486.75 \u2192 A=6.\n\n89*6=534 \u2192 I=601-534=67. No, I can't be 67. So invalid.\n\nR=5 \u2192 501=89A +I.\n\nA\u2264501/89\u22485.62 \u2192 A=5.\n\n89*5=445. I=501-445=56. Not possible.\n\nR=4 \u2192401=89A +I.\n\nA\u2264401/89\u22484.5 \u2192 A=4.\n\n89*4=356 \u2192 I=401-356=45. No.\n\nR=3 \u2192301=89A +I.\n\nA\u2264301/89\u22483.38 \u2192 A=3.\n\n89*3=267 \u2192 I=301-267=34. No.\n\nR=2 \u2192201=89A +I.\n\nA\u2264201/89\u22482.258 \u2192 A=2.\n\n89*2=178 \u2192 I=201-178=23. No.\n\nR=1 \u2192101=89A +I.\n\nA\u2264101/89\u22481.13 \u2192 A=1.\n\n89*1=89 \u2192 I=101-89=12. No.\n\nSo the only possible solution is R=8, A=9, I=0.\n\nSo A=9, R=8, I=0.\n\nNow, let's see what that gives us.\n\nSo E=1, A=9.\n\nNow, the first partial product is MAD \u00d71 = MAD.\n\nThe second partial product is B \u00d7 MAD = R A E = R A E \u2192 R=8, A=9, E=1. So R A E is 8 9 1, which is 891.\n\nSo B \u00d7 MAD =891.\n\nBut B is a single digit, so B must be a divisor of 891.\n\nLet me factor 891 to find possible B values.\n\n891 \u00f7 9 = 99 \u2192 9 \u00d799=891. So B=9, MAD=99.\n\nWait, but MAD is a three-digit number. 99 is two digits. So that's not possible. So B can't be 9.\n\nWait, perhaps B=3. Let's check: 891 \u00f73 = 297. So MAD=297. Which is a three-digit number. So possible.\n\nAlternatively, 891 \u00f7 1=891 \u2192 MAD=891, but B would be 1. But let's check if that's possible.\n\nWait, if B=1, then BE is 11. So MAD \u00d711 = AMID.\n\nWait, let me think. Let's see what's possible.\n\nWait, the options given are for the digits M, A, D, I. Let me see.\n\nWait, from our earlier deduction, A is 9, I is 0, E is 1, R is8.\n\nSo the four-digit number is AMID= 9 M 0 D.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sum is A M I D, which is a four-digit number. Since A=9, it's 9 M 0 D.\n\nWait, no, the sum is AMID, which is 1000A + 100M + 10I + D. So A=9, I=0, so it's 9 M 0 D.\n\nBut earlier, from the sum equation, we have that when we add MAD and RAE0, we get 9 M 0 D.\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\nMAD (three digits) + RAE0 (four digits) = 9 M 0 D.\n\nBut let's think about the addition:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n   MAD\n+ RAE0\n= 9M0D\n\nBut RAE is 891, so RAE0 is 8910.\n\nSo the sum is MAD + 8910 = 9M0D.\n\nSo, MAD is a three-digit number, 9M0D is a four-digit number. So 9M0D is between 1000 and 9999.\n\nSo, MAD must be between (1000 - 8910) which is negative, which can't be, so that can't be right. Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, RAE0 is 8910, which is a four-digit number. So adding MAD (a three-digit number) to 8910 (four-digit) gives a four-digit number 9M0D.\n\nSo, 8910 + MAD = 9M0D.\n\nSo, 9M0D is a four-digit number starting with 9. So 9M0D is between 9000 and 9999.\n\nSo, 8910 + MAD = 9000 + (M*100) + 0*10 + D.\n\nWhich implies MAD = 9000 + M*100 + D - 8910.\n\nSimplify: MAD = (9000 - 8910) + M*100 + D \u2192 90 + M*100 + D.\n\nSo, MAD = M*100 + D +90.\n\nBut MAD is a three-digit number, which is 100*M + 10*A + D.\n\nSince A=9, MAD = 100*M + 90 + D.\n\nSo,\n\n100*M +90 + D = M*100 + D +90 \u2192 which is the same on both sides. So this doesn't give any new information.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the sum numerically.\n\nSum is 8910 + MAD = 9M0D.\n\nSo, 8910 + (100M + 90 + D) = 9000 + 100M + 0*10 + D.\n\nWait, let me compute left side:\n\n8910 + 100M +90 + D = 100M + 8910 +90 + D = 100M + 9000 + D.\n\nRight side is 9000 + 100M + D.\n\nSo, both sides are equal. So this doesn't help. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the multiplication of B \u00d7 MAD =891.\n\nBecause R A E is 891, which is B \u00d7 MAD.\n\nSo, B \u00d7 MAD =891.\n\nBut MAD is a three-digit number, so MAD= 891 / B.\n\nSince B is a digit (1-9), let's find which B divides 891 and gives a three-digit MAD.\n\n891 \u00f7 B must be a three-digit integer.\n\nPossible B:\n\nLet me check B=3 \u2192 891 \u00f73=297. So MAD=297.\n\nB=9 \u2192 891 \u00f79=99. But 99 is two-digit, so invalid.\n\nB=1 \u2192 891. MAD=891. So possible.\n\nB= 2 \u2192 891/2=445.5 \u2192 not integer.\n\nB= 3 \u2192297.\n\nB= 6 \u2192891/6=148.5 \u2192 no.\n\nB= 7 \u2192 891/7\u2248127.285 \u2192 no.\n\nB= 9 \u219299, which is two-digit, so no.\n\nSo possible B values are 1 and 3.\n\nCase 1: B=1 \u2192 MAD=891.\n\nSo, BE would be 11 (since B=1, E=1).\n\nThen, the multiplication would be 891 \u00d7 11 = ?\n\nLet me compute that: 891 \u00d711 = 9801.\n\nSo, the result should be AMID=9801.\n\nWhich would make A=9, M=8, I=0, D=1.\n\nSo, checking the letters:\n\nM=8, A=9, D=1.\n\nSo the digits would be:\n\nM=8, A=9, D=1.\n\nBE=11.\n\nSo the sum of the partial products would be:\n\nFirst partial product: 891 \u00d71=891 \u2192 written as MAD=891, which matches.\n\nSecond partial product: 891 \u00d71 (since B=1) \u2192 but shifted left by one, so 8910.\n\nAdding 891 + 8910 = 9801 \u2192 AMID=9801.\n\nSo A=9, M=8, I=0, D=1.\n\nSo the digits are M=8, A=9, D=1.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, let me see what the options are. The options are given as four-digit numbers, each representing M, A, D, I.\n\nWait, the question is to decipher the multiplication table, which gives the digits M, A, D, I. The options are:\n\nA)9 2 0 0\n\nB)9 2 0 9\n\nC)9 2 0 1\n\nD)9 2 0 7\n\nE)9 2 2 2\n\nWait, but according to this case, M=8, A=9, D=1, I=0. So the digits are 8,9,1,0. But the options have A as 9, M as 2 in all options except for option A which is 9 2 0 0, etc. Wait, no, the options are four-digit numbers, but they are labeled as options A to E, each with four digits.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=0. No, wait, no, I think the options are for M, A, D, I. So each option gives the four digits in order M, A, D, I.\n\nWait, the question says, \"Decipher the following multiplication table: ... Options: A)9 2 0 0 etc.\"\n\nSo each option is a four-digit number where the digits are M, A, D, I in that order.\n\nWait, no, the options are:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=0.\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=9.\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=1.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=7.\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=2, I=2.\n\nWait, but in our case, M=8, A=9, D=1, I=0. So none of the options match that. Because the options have M=9 and A=2, which is conflicting with our deduction where A=9.\n\nSo perhaps this case is not possible. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nIn the first case, B=1, MAD=891, BE=11, product=9801.\n\nSo the four-digit number is AMID=9801.\n\nSo A=9, M=8, I=0, D=1.\n\nThus, the digits are M=8, A=9, D=1, I=0.\n\nLooking at the options, none match this. Because all options have M=9 and A=2. So perhaps this case is not the right path.\n\nLet me check the other case where B=3.\n\nCase 2: B=3 \u2192 MAD=891/3=297.\n\nSo MAD=297 \u2192 M=2, A=9, D=7.\n\nBE is 31 (since B=3, E=1).\n\nSo, let's compute MAD \u00d7 BE = 297 \u00d731.\n\n297 \u00d731: Let's compute.\n\n297 \u00d730 = 8910.\n\n297 \u00d71=297.\n\nAdding 8910 +297=9207.\n\nSo the product is 9207.\n\nWhich would be AMID=9207.\n\nSo A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7.\n\nSo digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D is 9 2 0 7 \u2192 which is M=9, A=2, D=0, I=7. No, that's not matching.\n\nWait, our digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nSo in the options, which one has M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 M=9, A=2. No.\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 M=9, A=2. No.\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 M=9, A=2. No.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 M=9, A=2. No.\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 M=9, A=2. No.\n\nWait, none of the options match this scenario. Hmm.\n\nSo perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me think about the partial products.\n\nWait, another approach: let's consider the first partial product is MAD \u00d7 E = MAD. So E must be 1, as we thought earlier.\n\nSo E=1.\n\nThe second partial product is B \u00d7 MAD, which is R A E. So B \u00d7 MAD = R A 1.\n\nBecause E is 1.\n\nSo R A E is R A 1.\n\nSo R A 1 = B \u00d7 MAD.\n\nBut MAD is a three-digit number, so B \u00d7 MAD is R A 1.\n\nSo, let's think about the multiplication:\n\nMAD \u00d7 B = R A 1.\n\nSo, R A 1 is a three-digit number.\n\nSo, B \u00d7 MAD is a three-digit number ending with 1.\n\nSo, the units digit of B \u00d7 D must be 1.\n\nBecause when you multiply B \u00d7 D, the units digit is 1.\n\nSo, possible pairs for B and D:\n\nLooking for B \u00d7 D \u22611 mod 10.\n\nPossible options:\n\nB=1 \u2192 D=1.\n\nB=3 \u2192 D=7 (since 3\u00d77=21 \u2192 1 in units place).\n\nB=7 \u2192 D=3 (7\u00d73=21).\n\nB=9 \u2192 D=9 (9\u00d79=81).\n\nSo possible (B,D) pairs: (1,1), (3,7), (7,3), (9,9).\n\nNow, let's go through each possibility.\n\nCase 1: B=1, D=1.\n\nThen, R A 1 =1 \u00d7 MAD = MAD.\n\nSo MAD = R A 1.\n\nBut MAD is a three-digit number, so R would be M, A would be A, and 1 is D.\n\nWhich is consistent, but let's check.\n\nThen, the sum is MAD + RAE0 = MAD + (MAD) shifted left (since B=1, RAE= MAD).\n\nSo sum is MAD + MAD \u00d710 = MAD \u00d711.\n\nWhich must equal AMID.\n\nSo, MAD \u00d711 = AMID.\n\nLet me think about what MAD \u00d711 would look like.\n\nMultiplying a three-digit number by 11:\n\nFor example, 234 \u00d711 = 2574.\n\nSo, the result is a four-digit number where the thousands digit is the same as the hundreds digit of MAD, and the hundreds digit is the sum of the hundreds and tens digits of MAD, etc.\n\nBut in this case, the product is AMID, which is a four-digit number.\n\nSo, let's model MAD \u00d711 = AMID.\n\nMAD is 100M +10A + D.\n\nSo, 11*(100M +10A + D) = 1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nWait, let me compute 11*(MAD):\n\n11*(100M +10A + D) = 1100M + 110A +11D.\n\nWhich should equal 1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nSo,\n\n1100M +110A +11D =1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nRearranging terms:\n\n1100M -100M +110A -1000A +11D - D =10I.\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000M -890A +10D =10I.\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n100M -89A + D = I.\n\nSo, I = 100M -89A + D.\n\nBut I is a single digit (0-9), so 100M -89A + D must be between 0 and 9.\n\nGiven that M and A are digits (M can be 1-9, A 0-9), let's see possible values.\n\nWe also know that in this case, B=1, D=1.\n\nSo, D=1.\n\nSo, I=100M -89A +1.\n\nAnd I must be between 0 and 9.\n\nSo,\n\n0 \u2264 100M -89A +1 \u22649.\n\nWhich implies:\n\n-1 \u2264 100M -89A \u22648.\n\nBut 100M is at least 100 (since M\u22651), and 89A can be up to 801 (if A=9).\n\nSo, 100M -89A \u2265100 - 801 = -701.\n\nBut for I to be non-negative, 100M -89A +1 \u22650 \u2192 100M -89A \u2265-1.\n\nBut 100M -89A must be \u22648, because I \u22649 \u2192 100M -89A +1 \u22649 \u2192 100M -89A \u22648.\n\nSo, 100M -89A must be between -1 and 8.\n\nBut 100M is positive, and 89A can be up to 801.\n\nHmm, let's see possible M and A values.\n\nM is at least 1.\n\nLet me try M=1:\n\nI=100*1 -89A +1 =101-89A.\n\nWe need 101 -89A \u22648 \u2192 89A \u226593 \u2192 A\u22651 (since 89*1=89 <93, so A must be \u22652.\n\nWait, 89A \u226593 \u2192 A \u2265 93/89 \u22481.04 \u2192 so A \u22652.\n\nBut for A=2:\n\nI=101-89*2=101-178= -77 \u2192 invalid, since I can't be negative.\n\nSo no solution for M=1.\n\nM=2:\n\nI=200 -89A +1=201 -89A.\n\nWe need 201 -89A \u22648 \u219289A \u2265193 \u2192 A\u2265193/89\u22482.168 \u2192 A=3.\n\nCheck A=3:\n\nI=201-267= -66 \u2192 invalid.\n\nA=2: I=201-178=23 \u2192 invalid.\n\nNo solution.\n\nM=3:\n\nI=300-89A +1=301-89A.\n\n301-89A \u22648 \u219289A \u2265293 \u2192 A\u22653.3 \u2192 A=4.\n\nA=4 \u2192 I=301-356= -55 \u2192 invalid.\n\nA=3 \u2192 I=301-267=34 \u2192 invalid.\n\nM=4:\n\nI=401-89A.\n\n401-89A \u22648 \u219289A\u2265393 \u2192A\u22654.416 \u2192A=5.\n\nA=5 \u2192 I=401-445= -44 \u2192 invalid.\n\nA=4 \u2192 I=401-356=45 \u2192 invalid.\n\nM=5:\n\nI=501-89A.\n\n501-89A \u22648 \u219289A \u2265493 \u2192A\u22655.54 \u2192 A=6.\n\nA=6 \u2192 I=501-534= -33 \u2192 invalid.\n\nA=5 \u2192 I=501-445=56 \u2192 invalid.\n\nM=6:\n\nI=601-89A.\n\n601-89A \u22648 \u219289A\u2265593 \u2192A\u22656.66 \u2192A=7.\n\nA=7 \u2192 I=601-623= -22 \u2192 invalid.\n\nA=6 \u2192 I=601-534=67 \u2192 invalid.\n\nM=7:\n\nI=701-89A.\n\n701-89A \u22648 \u219289A\u2265693 \u2192A\u22657.786 \u2192A=8.\n\nA=8 \u2192 I=701-712= -11 \u2192 invalid.\n\nA=7 \u2192 I=701-623=78 \u2192 invalid.\n\nM=8:\n\nI=801-89A.\n\n801-89A \u22648 \u219289A\u2265793 \u2192A\u22658.898 \u2192A=9.\n\nA=9 \u2192 I=801-801=0 \u2192 valid.\n\nSo, M=8, A=9, I=0.\n\nSo, this gives:\n\nM=8, A=9, D=1 (from earlier case), I=0.\n\nSo, digits are M=8, A=9, D=1, I=0.\n\nSo, AMID=9 8 0 1.\n\nBut the options don't have this. The options have M=9 and A=2. So perhaps this case isn't possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nIn this case, B=1 and D=1.\n\nSo, the product is MAD \u00d7 11 = AMID.\n\nWith M=8, A=9, D=1, I=0.\n\nSo, the product is 891 \u00d711=9801.\n\nWhich matches. So AMID=9801.\n\nBut in the options, none have M=8, A=9, D=1, I=0. So perhaps this isn't the correct path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the other possibilities for B and D.\n\nLet's try another case.\n\nCase 2: B=3, D=7.\n\nSo, R A 1 =3 \u00d7 MAD.\n\nMAD is a three-digit number, so 3 \u00d7 MAD is a three-digit number R A 1.\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 MAD = R A 1.\n\nAlso, in this case, the sum is MAD + RAE0 = AMID.\n\nWhere R A E is R A 1.\n\nSo, R A 1 =3 \u00d7 MAD.\n\nSo, R A 1 is 3 \u00d7 MAD.\n\nSo, MAD must be such that when multiplied by 3, the result is R A 1, a three-digit number ending with 1.\n\nSo, MAD must be a number such that 3 \u00d7 MAD ends with 1.\n\nWhich implies that D \u00d73 ends with 1. Since D=7, 7 \u00d73=21 \u2192 ends with 1. So that's correct.\n\nSo, let's find MAD such that 3 \u00d7 MAD is R A 1.\n\nLet me express MAD as 100M +10A +7.\n\n3*(100M +10A +7) = 300M +30A +21.\n\nBut this equals 100R +10A +1.\n\nSo,\n\n300M +30A +21 = 100R +10A +1.\n\nRearranging:\n\n300M +30A +21 -10A -1 = 100R \u2192 300M +20A +20 = 100R.\n\nDivide both sides by 20:\n\n15M + A +1 =5R.\n\nSo,\n\n5R =15M + A +1.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n5R =15M +A +1.\n\nSince R is a digit (1-9), 5R must be between 5 and 45.\n\nSo,\n\n15M +A +1 \u226445.\n\nBut M is a digit (1-9).\n\nLet me see possible M values.\n\nM can be 1, 2, or 3, because 15*3=45, so 15M +A +1 \u226445.\n\nM=1:\n\n5R=15*1 +A +1 \u21925R=16 +A.\n\nA is a digit (0-9), so 16+A must be divisible by 5.\n\nPossible A values:\n\n16+A must be 20 or 25 (since 16+4=20, 16+9=25).\n\nSo A=4 \u2192 16+4=20 \u2192 R=4.\n\nOr A=9 \u219216+9=25 \u2192 R=5.\n\nSo possible pairs:\n\nM=1, A=4, R=4.\n\nOr M=1, A=9, R=5.\n\nLet me check each.\n\nSubcase 2a: M=1, A=4, R=4.\n\nSo, MAD=147 (since M=1, A=4, D=7).\n\nCheck 3 \u00d7147=441.\n\nWhich is R A 1 \u2192 R=4, A=4, which matches.\n\nSo R=4, A=4. But earlier in this case, A=4, but in this subcase, A is 4, but earlier in this case, the A was supposed to be 9. Wait, no, in this case, A is a variable. Wait, no, in this case, A is 4.\n\nWait, in this scenario, A=4, so the four-digit product is AMID=4 M I 7.\n\nWait, no, AMID is A M I D.\n\nWait, in this case, A=4, M=1, I is to be determined, D=7.\n\nSo, the sum is MAD + RAE0 =147 + R A 1 \u00d710 \u2192 R A 1 is 441, so RAE0=4410.\n\nSo, 147 +4410=4557.\n\nSo, AMID=4557.\n\nWhich is A=4, M=5, I=5, D=7.\n\nBut wait, in our subcase, M was 1. So that doesn't match. Because M is 1, but in the product, it's 4557, which has M=5. So this is a conflict.\n\nHmm, perhaps this subcase isn't valid.\n\nSubcase 2b: M=1, A=9, R=5.\n\nSo, MAD=197.\n\n3 \u00d7197=591.\n\nSo R A 1=591 \u2192 R=5, A=9, which matches.\n\nSo, R=5, A=9.\n\nNow, the sum is MAD + RAE0 =197 +5910=6107.\n\nSo, AMID=6107.\n\nWhich would be A=6, M=1, I=0, D=7.\n\nBut in this subcase, A=9, but the product has A=6. So conflict.\n\nThus, this subcase isn't valid.\n\nM=2:\n\n5R=15*2 +A +1 \u21925R=30 +A +1=31+A.\n\n31+A must be divisible by 5.\n\nSo 31+A \u22610 mod5 \u2192 A \u2261-31 mod5 \u2192 -31 mod5 is 4, because 31/5=6*5=30, 31-30=1 \u2192 31 mod5=1 \u2192 -31 mod5=4.\n\nSo A must be 4 or 9 (since 4 and 9 are the digits where A mod5=4).\n\nSo, A=4 or 9.\n\nSubcase 2c: M=2, A=4.\n\nThen, 5R=31+4=35 \u2192 R=7.\n\nSo, MAD=247.\n\n3 \u00d7247=741.\n\nWhich is R A 1=741 \u2192 R=7, A=4, which matches.\n\nSum is MAD + RAE0 =247 +7410=7657.\n\nAMID=7657 \u2192 A=7, M=6, I=5, D=7.\n\nBut in this subcase, A=4, but the product has A=7. So conflict.\n\nSubcase 2d: M=2, A=9.\n\n5R=31+9=40 \u2192 R=8.\n\nSo, MAD=297.\n\n3\u00d7297=891.\n\nWhich is R A 1=891 \u2192 R=8, A=9, which matches.\n\nSum is 297 +8910=9207.\n\nAMID=9207 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7.\n\nWhich matches our subcase variables: A=9, M=2, D=7, I=0.\n\nSo the digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nLooking at the options, the option D is 9 2 0 7, which would correspond to M=9, A=2, D=0, I=7. No, that's not matching.\n\nWait, the digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0. So the four-digit number is 9207. So the digits are A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 9 2 0 7 \u2192 which is A=9, M=2, D=0, I=7. Wait, but D is 7, not 0. So no match.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the sum again.\n\nSum is MAD + RAE0 =297 +8910=9207.\n\nYes, so AMID=9207 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7.\n\nSo, the four-digit number is 9207.\n\nSo, the digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nLooking at the options, none of them have M=2 and A=9. The options all have M=9 and A=2.\n\nSo perhaps this case is not the right path.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the earlier assumption. Let me think.\n\nWait, the sum is AMID=9207.\n\nWhich is A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7.\n\nSo, the digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nLooking back at the options, the options are for M, A, D, I.\n\nSo, the digits would be M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nSo, the four-digit number is 2 9 7 0. But the options don't have this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check another case.\n\nCase 3: B=7, D=3.\n\nSo, R A 1=7 \u00d7 MAD.\n\nSo, 7 \u00d7 MAD must end with 1. Since D=3, 3\u00d77=21 \u2192 ends with 1.\n\nSo, let's find MAD such that 7 \u00d7 MAD is R A 1.\n\nMAD=100M +10A +3.\n\n7*(100M +10A +3) =700M +70A +21.\n\nThis should equal 100R +10A +1.\n\nSo,\n\n700M +70A +21 =100R +10A +1.\n\nRearranging:\n\n700M +70A +21 -10A -1 =100R \u2192700M +60A +20=100R.\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n70M +6A +2 =10R.\n\nWhich implies:\n\n10R =70M +6A +2.\n\nSince R is a digit (1-9), 10R must be between 10 and 90.\n\nSo,\n\n70M +6A +2 \u226490.\n\n70M \u226490-6A-2 \u219270M \u226488-6A.\n\nBut M is at least 1.\n\n70*1=70 \u226488-6A \u21926A \u226418 \u2192A \u22643.\n\nSo A can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nLet's try M=1:\n\nThen,\n\n10R=70*1 +6A +2=72 +6A.\n\nSo, 10R=72+6A.\n\nSince R must be an integer, 72+6A must be divisible by 10.\n\nSo, 72 +6A \u22610 mod10 \u2192 72 mod10=2 \u2192 2 +6A mod10=0 \u21926A mod10=8.\n\nSo, 6A \u22618 mod10.\n\nLooking for A (0-3) where 6A mod10=8.\n\nA= 0 \u21920 \u2192 no.\n\nA=1 \u21926 \u2192 no.\n\nA=2 \u219212 mod10=2 \u2192 no.\n\nA=3 \u219218 mod10=8 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo, A=3.\n\nSo, R= (72+6*3)/10 \u2192 (72+18)/10=90/10=9.\n\nSo, R=9.\n\nSo, MAD=133 (M=1, A=3, D=3).\n\nWait, wait, D is 3 in this case.\n\nSo, MAD=133.\n\nCheck 7 \u00d7133=931.\n\nWhich is R A 1=931 \u2192 R=9, A=3, which matches.\n\nNow, the sum is MAD + RAE0 =133 +9310=9443.\n\nSo, AMID=9443 \u2192 A=9, M=4, I=4, D=3.\n\nBut in our subcase, A=3, which conflicts with the product's A=9.\n\nSo, this is invalid.\n\nM=1 is not possible.\n\nM=0 is not possible because MAD is a three-digit number.\n\nSo, M must be \u22651.\n\nWait, perhaps M=0 is allowed? No, because MAD is a three-digit number, M can't be zero.\n\nSo, no solution in this case.\n\nCase 4: B=9, D=9.\n\nSo, R A 1=9 \u00d7 MAD.\n\nSince D=9, 9 \u00d79=81 \u2192 ends with 1.\n\nSo, 9 \u00d7 MAD must end with 1.\n\nSo, MAD must be such that 9 \u00d7 MAD ends with 1.\n\nWhich implies that D \u00d79 ends with 1. D=9 \u21929 \u00d79=81 \u2192 ends with 1. So that's correct.\n\nSo, 9 \u00d7 MAD = R A 1.\n\nLet me write MAD as 100M +10A +9.\n\n9*(100M +10A +9) =900M +90A +81.\n\nThis equals 100R +10A +1.\n\nSo,\n\n900M +90A +81 =100R +10A +1.\n\nRearranging:\n\n900M +90A +81 -10A -1 =100R \u2192900M +80A +80 =100R.\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n90M +8A +8 =10R.\n\nSo,\n\n10R=90M +8A +8.\n\nSince R is a digit (1-9), 10R must be between 10 and 90.\n\nSo,\n\n90M +8A +8 \u226490.\n\n90M \u226490 -8A -8 \u219290M \u226482 -8A.\n\nSince M is at least 1:\n\n90*1=90 \u226482-8A \u21928A \u2264-8 \u2192A \u2264-1.\n\nBut A is a digit (0-9), so no solution in this case.\n\nThus, B=9 is invalid.\n\nSo, from all the cases, the only possible valid solution is when B=3 and D=7, leading to AMID=9207, with M=2, A=9, I=0, D=7.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps.\n\nWait, let me go back to the initial assumption.\n\nWait, the sum is MAD + RAE0 = AMID.\n\nWhich is (100M +10A + D) + (1000R +100A +10E +0) =1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nBut E=1.\n\nSo, substituting E=1:\n\n(100M +10A + D) + (1000R +100A +10) =1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nSimplify:\n\n100M +10A + D +1000R +100A +10 =1000A +100M +10I +D.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(100M +100M) \u2192 200M? Wait, no, the right side has 100M.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nLeft side:\n\n100M +10A + D +1000R +100A +10 = 100M + (10A +100A) + D +1000R +10 =100M +110A + D +1000R +10.\n\nRight side:\n\n1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nSo,\n\n100M +110A + D +1000R +10 =1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nSubtract 100M and D from both sides:\n\n110A +1000R +10 =1000A +10I.\n\nRearranged:\n\n1000R +10 =890A +10I.\n\nDivide by 10:\n\n100R +1 =89A + I.\n\nWhich we did earlier.\n\nSo, in this case, the only solution is R=8, A=9, I=0.\n\nSo, the digits are A=9, R=8, I=0.\n\nSo, the four-digit product is 9 M 0 D.\n\nAnd the sum is MAD + RAE0 =9 M 0 D.\n\nWe have R=8, so RAE is 891.\n\nSo, RAE0=8910.\n\nSo, MAD +8910=9 M 0 D.\n\nSo, MAD=9 M 0 D -8910.\n\nBut MAD is a three-digit number.\n\nSo, 9 M 0 D is a four-digit number starting with 9, so it's between 9000 and 9999.\n\nSo, MAD= (9000 + M*100 +0*10 + D) -8910.\n\nSimplify:\n\nMAD=9000 +100M +D -8910=90 +100M +D.\n\nBut MAD is also equal to 100M +10A +D.\n\nSince A=9, MAD=100M +90 +D.\n\nSo,\n\n100M +90 +D=90 +100M +D \u2192 which is the same on both sides. So, no new information.\n\nBut we can find D from the fact that B \u00d7 MAD = RAE=891.\n\nSo, B \u00d7 MAD=891.\n\nAnd B is a single digit, so B must be a divisor of 891.\n\nFactors of 891: 891= 3^3 \u00d7 33, etc. Let me list the possible B values.\n\n891 \u00f79=99 \u2192 B=9, MAD=99 \u2192 but MAD is three-digit, so invalid.\n\n891 \u00f73=297 \u2192 B=3, MAD=297.\n\nSo, B=3, MAD=297.\n\nSo, MAD=297 \u2192 M=2, A=9, D=7.\n\nSo, the digits are M=2, A=9, D=7.\n\nThe sum is MAD + RAE0=297 +8910=9207 \u2192 AMID=9207.\n\nSo, A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7.\n\nSo, the four-digit number is 9207.\n\nThus, the digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nLooking at the options, none match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption that E=1 is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nIn the multiplication, the first partial product is E \u00d7 MAD = MAD.\n\nSo, E \u00d7 MAD = MAD.\n\nWhich implies E=1, since MAD \u00d71 = MAD.\n\nSo, E must be 1.\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the only valid solution is AMID=9207, with M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nBut the options don't have this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=0.\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=9.\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=1.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=7.\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=2, I=2.\n\nWait, in all options, M=9, A=2.\n\nBut according to our solution, M=2, A=9.\n\nSo perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the setup is different. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the multiplication is:\n\n   MAD\n\u00d7  BE\n-------\n    MAD (E \u00d7 MAD)\n  RAE (B \u00d7 MAD)\n-------\n  AMID\n\nWait, no, in the multiplication, the second partial product is shifted left by one, so it's RAE shifted left, making it RAE0.\n\nBut perhaps the way the problem is presented, the second partial product is written as R A E, but it's actually RAE shifted left by one, which would be R A E 0.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the second partial product is written as R A E, not R A E 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misinterpreted the way the partial products are written.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second partial product is written as R A E, but it's actually shifted left by one, so it's R A E \u00d710, making it a four-digit number.\n\nSo, the first partial product is MAD (three digits), the second is RAE \u00d710 (four digits), and their sum is AMID (four digits).\n\nSo, sum is MAD + RAE \u00d710 = AMID.\n\nWhich is,\n\n(100M +10A + D) + (1000R +100A +10E +0) =1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nBut E=1.\n\nSo,\n\n100M +10A + D +1000R +100A +10 =1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nSimplify:\n\n100M +110A + D +1000R +10 =1000A +100M +10I +D.\n\nCancel 100M and D:\n\n110A +1000R +10 =1000A +10I.\n\nRearranged:\n\n1000R +10 =890A +10I.\n\nDivide by 10:\n\n100R +1=89A +I.\n\nWhich is the same equation as before.\n\nSo, R=8, A=9, I=0.\n\nSo, R=8, A=9, I=0.\n\nSo, the four-digit product is AMID=9 M 0 D.\n\nAnd the partial products are MAD and RAE0.\n\nRAE is B \u00d7 MAD= R A E=8 9 1.\n\nSo, B \u00d7 MAD=891.\n\nSo, B is a single digit, MAD is three-digit.\n\nSo, possible B=3 \u2192 MAD=297.\n\nSo, B=3, MAD=297.\n\nSo, M=2, A=9, D=7.\n\nSum is MAD + RAE0=297 +8910=9207 \u2192 AMID=9207.\n\nSo, A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7.\n\nSo, the digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nLooking at the options, none match. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the partial products.\n\nWait, perhaps the second partial product is not RAE shifted left by one, but rather, it's shifted left by one digit, so RAE becomes RAE0, but written as R A E in the multiplication, but when shifted, it's RAE0.\n\nBut in the problem, the multiplication is shown as:\n\n   MAD\n\u00d7  BE\n-------\n    MAD\n  RAE\n-------\n  AMID\n\nSo, the second partial product is RAE, but in reality, it's RAE shifted left by one, making it RAE0.\n\nSo, when adding MAD and RAE0, we get AMID.\n\nSo, the sum is MAD + RAE0 = AMID.\n\nWhich is:\n\n(100M +10A + D) + (1000R + 100A + 10E + 0) =1000A + 100M + 10I + D.\n\nBut E=1.\n\nSo,\n\n100M +10A + D +1000R +100A +10 =1000A +100M +10I +D.\n\nSimplify:\n\n100M +110A + D +1000R +10 =1000A +100M +10I +D.\n\nCancel terms:\n\n110A +1000R +10 =1000A +10I.\n\nRearranged:\n\n1000R +10 =890A +10I.\n\nDivide by 10:\n\n100R +1=89A +I.\n\nWhich leads us to R=8, A=9, I=0.\n\nSo, the digits are A=9, R=8, I=0.\n\nSo, the sum is MAD + RAE0= AMID=9 M 0 D.\n\nSo, MAD= (9000 + M*100 + D) -8910.\n\nWhich is 90 +100M + D.\n\nBut MAD is also 100M +90 + D.\n\nSo, same as before.\n\nSo, the only possible B is 3, leading to MAD=297.\n\nThus, the digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option D)9 2 0 7.\n\nWait, option D is 9 2 0 7 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=7.\n\nBut according to our solution, M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nSo, this doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial product setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the second partial product is R A E, but not shifted, so the sum is MAD + RAE \u00d710 = AMID.\n\nWhich is:\n\n(100M +10A + D) + (1000R +100A +10E) = 1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nBut E=1.\n\nSo,\n\n100M +10A + D +1000R +100A +10 =1000A +100M +10I +D.\n\nSimplify:\n\n100M +110A + D +1000R +10 =1000A +100M +10I +D.\n\nCancel 100M and D:\n\n110A +1000R +10 =1000A +10I.\n\nRearranged:\n\n1000R +10 =890A +10I.\n\nDivide by 10:\n\n100R +1=89A +I.\n\nWhich is the same equation.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the solution is M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option D)9 2 0 7.\n\nWait, because in that case, M=9, A=2, D=0, I=7.\n\nBut that would mean the sum is AMID=2907.\n\nWait, let me compute.\n\nIf M=9, A=2, D=0, I=7.\n\nThen, MAD=920.\n\nBE is B E.\n\nThe partial products would be:\n\nE \u00d7920 =920 \u00d7E.\n\nWhich should be the first partial product.\n\nThe second partial product is B \u00d7920, shifted left by one.\n\nSum is 920 \u00d7 BE =2907.\n\nWait, 920 \u00d7 BE=2907.\n\nBut 2907 \u00f7920 \u22483.16, which is not an integer. So BE would be a two-digit number, but 920 \u00d73=2760, which is less than 2907.\n\nSo, this can't be correct.\n\nThus, perhaps the correct answer is option D)9 2 0 7.\n\nBut according to the calculations, the correct digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0, which isn't among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first partial product is E \u00d7 MAD, which is written as MAD, implying E=1.\n\nSo, E=1.\n\nThe second partial product is B \u00d7 MAD, written as R A E (which is R A 1).\n\nSo, R A 1 = B \u00d7 MAD.\n\nSo, B \u00d7 MAD = R A 1.\n\nWhich is a three-digit number ending with 1.\n\nSo, D \u00d7 B must end with 1.\n\nPossible D and B pairs are (1,1), (3,7), (7,3), (9,9).\n\nWe tried all these and the only valid case was when B=3, D=7, leading to AMID=9207.\n\nSo, the digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nBut none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct option is option D)9 2 0 7.\n\nBecause in this case, AMID=9207, which is A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7.\n\nSo, the digits are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nSo, the option would be M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0.\n\nBut the options don't have this combination. So perhaps the intended answer is option D)9 2 0 7, but the digits don't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D)9 2 0 7, even though the digits don't align perfectly, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option D)9 2 0 7.\n\n\nThe problem involves deciphering a multiplication table where the multiplicand is a three-digit number **MAD**, the multiplier is a two-digit number **BE**, and the product is a four-digit number **AMID**. The multiplication setup is as follows:\n\n```\n   MAD\n\u00d7  BE\n-------\n    MAD   (E \u00d7 MAD)\n  RAE    (B \u00d7 MAD, shifted left by one)\n-------\n  AMID\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **E = 1**: The first partial product is **MAD**, which implies that multiplying **MAD** by **E** results in **MAD** itself. This is only possible if **E = 1**.\n\n2. **Second Partial Product**: The second partial product is **RAE**, which represents **B \u00d7 MAD**. Since **RAE** is a three-digit number, **B \u00d7 MAD** must also be a three-digit number. This constrains **B** to a single digit (1-9) and **MAD** to a three-digit number.\n\n3. **Sum of Partial Products**: The sum of the partial products (**MAD + RAE0**) equals the final product **AMID**. This gives the equation:\n   \\[\n   (100M + 10A + D) + (1000R + 100A + 10E) = 1000A + 100M + 10I + D\n   \\]\n   Substituting **E = 1**, this simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   100M + 110A + D + 1000R + 10 = 1000A + 100M + 10I + D\n   \\]\n   Canceling terms and rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   1000R + 10 = 890A + 10I\n   \\]\n   Dividing by 10:\n   \\[\n   100R + 1 = 89A + I\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for R, A, I**: The equation \\(100R + 1 = 89A + I\\) must hold, where \\(R, A, I\\) are digits (0-9). Testing possible values:\n   - For \\(R = 8\\), \\(100(8) + 1 = 801\\), which gives \\(89A + I = 801\\). Solving this:\n     - \\(A = 9\\), \\(I = 0\\) (since \\(89 \\times 9 = 801\\), leaving \\(I = 0\\)).\n\n5. **Determining M and D**:\n   - From the second partial product, \\(B \\times MAD = RAE = 891\\). Since \\(B\\) is a single digit, \\(B = 3\\) and \\(MAD = 891 / 3 = 297\\).\n   - Thus, \\(M = 2\\), \\(A = 9\\), \\(D = 7\\).\n\n6. **Final Product**: The sum of the partial products is:\n   \\[\n   MAD + RAE0 = 297 + 8910 = 9207\n   \\]\n   This matches the four-digit product \\(AMID = 9207\\), confirming \\(A = 9\\), \\(M = 2\\), \\(I = 0\\), \\(D = 7\\).\n\n### Matching with Options:\nThe digits are \\(M = 2\\), \\(A = 9\\), \\(D = 7\\), \\(I = 0\\). However, none of the options directly match this combination. The closest option is **D) 9 2 0 7**, which corresponds to \\(M = 9\\), \\(A = 2\\), \\(D = 0\\), \\(I = 7\\). While this does not perfectly align with the derived digits, it is the most plausible choice given the options.\n\nANSWER: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this multiplication table puzzle here, and I'm supposed to figure out which option is the correct one. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nThe problem looks like a vertical multiplication setup. Here's what the table shows:\n\n   M A D\n\u00d7   B E\n------------\n   M A D\n R A E\n------------\nA M I D\n\nHmm, so it's a multiplication of a three-digit number MAD by a two-digit number BE, resulting in a four-digit number AMID. The intermediate steps are MAD and RA E, which probably comes from MAD multiplied by E, and then another line from MAD multiplied by B (maybe shifted one position to the left). Then adding those together gives AMID.\n\nLet me think about the structure. The multiplication is likely:\n\n   MAD\n\u00d7   BE\n-------\n    MAD  (this is MAD \u00d7 E)\n  RA E   (this is MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one)\n-------\nAMID\n\nWait, but RA E is a three-digit number, which when added to MAD (a three-digit number) would give a four-digit number AMID. So when you add MAD (three digits) and RA E (three digits, but shifted), the sum must be four digits.\n\nLet me think about the digits. Let's denote each letter as a digit. So M, A, D, B, E, R, I are digits. Also, since MAD is a three-digit number, M can't be zero. Similarly, BE is a two-digit number, so B can't be zero.\n\nLooking at the multiplication, perhaps E is the units digit of BE, and B is the tens digit. So when you multiply MAD by E, you get MAD, which is a three-digit number. Wait, that's interesting because multiplying a three-digit number by a single digit (E) gives the same three-digit number. That can only happen if E is 1 because any number multiplied by 1 is itself. So E must be 1.\n\nWait, but looking at the multiplication, when you multiply MAD by E, the result is MAD. So E must be 1. Let me write that down: E = 1.\n\nSo now, the multiplication becomes:\n\n   MAD\n\u00d7   B1\n-------\n    MAD  (from MAD \u00d7 1)\n  R A 1  (from MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one)\n-------\nAMID\n\nWait, but when you multiply MAD by B (the tens digit), you get a three-digit number R A 1. Because B is in the tens place, multiplying MAD by B would give a number that's shifted left, so when adding, it's equivalent to MAD \u00d7 B \u00d7 10.\n\nSo, the two partial products are MAD and R A 1 \u00d7 10. Adding these together gives AMID.\n\nLet me write the addition:\n\n      MAD\n+  R A 1 0\n----------\n   AMID\n\nWait, but adding MAD and R A 1 0 (which is R A 1 shifted left by one, so it's a four-digit number if R is non-zero). But AMID is four digits, so R A 1 must be a three-digit number such that when shifted left, it's four digits. So R must be non-zero.\n\nWait, but when you add MAD (three digits) to R A 1 0 (four digits), the sum is AMID, which is four digits. So the sum is a four-digit number. Let me think about how the addition works.\n\nLet me denote the digits:\n\nMAD is three digits: M (hundreds), A (tens), D (units).\n\nR A 1 0 is four digits: R (thousands), A (hundreds), 1 (tens), 0 (units).\n\nWait, no. Because when you multiply by B (tens), the result is MAD \u00d7 B, which is a three-digit number R A E, but E is 1, so R A 1. Then, when you shift it left by one, it becomes R A 1 0.\n\nWait, but that would make it a four-digit number. So when adding MAD (three digits) to R A 1 0 (four digits), the sum is AMID (four digits). So the addition is:\n\n      MAD (three digits)\n+ R A 1 0 (four digits)\n= AMID (four digits)\n\nBut how can a three-digit number plus a four-digit number result in a four-digit number? That makes sense. So the four-digit number R A 1 0 is larger than MAD, so when you add them, you get a four-digit number starting with A.\n\nWait, but let me think about the addition:\n\nLet me line them up:\n\n    M A D\n+ R A 1 0\n-----------\nA M I D\n\nWait, that can't be right because the sum's thousands place is A, and the addends are M (hundreds) and R (thousands). So when adding, the thousands place comes from R plus any carry-over from the hundreds addition.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as:\n\nR A 1 0\n+    M A D\n----------\nA M I D\n\nBecause when you add the two partial products, the first is R A 1 0 (four digits) and the second is MAD (three digits), so the alignment is:\n\n   R A 1 0\n+     M A D\n= A M I D\n\nWait, but how does that add up? Let's think about each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n0 (from R A 1 0) + D (from MAD) = D (units place of sum). So 0 + D = D \u2192 no problem, no carry.\n\nTens place: 1 (from R A 1 0) + A (from MAD) = I (tens place of sum). So 1 + A = I. So I = A + 1. But since I is a digit, A must be \u22648, because if A is 9, I would be 10, which is not a single digit. So I = A +1.\n\nHundreds place: A (from R A 1 0) + M (from MAD) = M (hundreds place of sum). So A + M = M + something? Wait, because when adding, there might be a carry from the tens place. Wait, let's see:\n\nTens place sum: 1 + A = I. If 1 + A is less than 10, then I is 1+A and carryover is 0. If 1+A >=10, then I is (1+A) mod 10, and carryover is 1.\n\nSo in the hundreds place:\n\nA (from R A 1 0) + M (from MAD) + carryover (from tens) = I (sum's hundreds digit is I?) Wait, no. Wait, the sum is A M I D. So the thousands digit is A, the hundreds digit is M, the tens is I, units is D.\n\nWait, so when adding R A 1 0 and MAD, the sum is A M I D.\n\nLet me write the addition:\n\nR A 1 0\n+   M A D\n= A M I D\n\nWait, perhaps the alignment is:\n\nR A 1 0\n+   M A D\n= A M I D\n\nSo the units place: 0 + D = D \u2192 okay.\n\nTens place: 1 + A = I \u2192 as before.\n\nHundreds place: A + M = M \u2192 So A + M must equal M plus any carry from the tens place.\n\nWait, so A + M + carry = M + 10 * carry_to_thousands. Let me think.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place of the sum, it's M. So (A + M + carry_from_tens) mod 10 = M.\n\nSo (A + M + carry) mod 10 = M \u2192 A + carry \u2261 0 mod 10. Because A + M + carry = M + 10k \u2192 A + carry = 10k.\n\nSince A is a digit (0-9), and carry can be 0 or 1 (since 1+A can be up to 9+1=10, so carry is 0 or 1), let's see possibilities.\n\nCase 1: carry_from_tens is 0.\n\nThen A = 10k. But A is a digit, so k must be 0 \u2192 A=0. But if A is zero, then in the tens place, 1 + A = 1 = I \u2192 I=1. Also, the thousands place: R + carry_from_hundreds = A.\n\nWait, but let's think about the thousands place. The sum is A in the thousands place, so R (from R A 1 0) plus any carry from the hundreds addition must equal A. So R + carry_from_hundreds = A.\n\nBut if carry_from_tens is 0, then in the hundreds place, A + M = M \u2192 A =0. So A=0. Then, in the tens place, 1 + A = I \u2192 I=1.\n\nNow, thousands place: R + carry_from_hundreds = A. But carry_from_hundreds comes from the hundreds addition: (A + M + carry_from_tens) = M + 10 * carry_from_hundreds.\n\nSince A=0, carry_from_tens is 0, so 0 + M + 0 = M \u2192 no carry. So R = A \u2192 R=0.\n\nBut R can't be zero because R A 1 is a three-digit number, and if R is 0, then RA1 would be 0A1, which is a two-digit number if A is non-zero. Wait, no: RA1 is a three-digit number, so R can't be zero. So R=0 is impossible. So this case leads to a contradiction. So A can't be zero.\n\nCase 2: carry_from_tens is 1.\n\nSo in the hundreds place:\n\nA + M + 1 = M + 10 * carry_from_thousands.\n\nSo A +1 = 10 * carry_from_thousands.\n\nSince A is a digit, A can be 9, with carry_from_thousands being 1. Because 9+1=10 \u2192 0 with carryover 1.\n\nSo A must be 9, and carry_from_thousands is 1.\n\nSo A=9.\n\nNow, in the tens place, 1 + A = I \u2192 1+9=10 \u2192 I=0, and carryover to hundreds is 1.\n\nWait, but I is a digit, so I=0, and carryover is 1.\n\nSo now, in the hundreds place, A + M +1 = M + 10*carry_from_thousands.\n\nSince A=9, it's 9 + M + 1 = M + 10*carry.\n\nSo 10 + M = M + 10*carry.\n\nSubtract M from both sides: 10 = 10*carry \u2192 carry=1.\n\nSo carry_from_thousands is 1.\n\nNow, looking at the thousands place: R + carry_from_thousands = A.\n\nSince carry_from_thousands is 1, R + 1 = A.\n\nBut A is 9, so R +1=9 \u2192 R=8.\n\nSo R=8.\n\nNow, let's summarize what we have so far:\n\nE=1, A=9, I=0, R=8.\n\nNow, the partial products are:\n\nMAD \u00d7 1 = MAD \u2192 that's given.\n\nMAD \u00d7 B = RA1 \u2192 which is 8 9 1.\n\nBecause R is 8, A is 9, E is 1. So MAD \u00d7 B = 891.\n\nWait, so MAD \u00d7 B = 891.\n\nBut MAD is a three-digit number, and B is a single digit. So MAD \u00d7 B = 891.\n\nSo MAD must be 891 divided by B.\n\nBut B is a single digit (since BE is a two-digit number, B can't be zero). So possible B values are 1 to 9.\n\nBut let's see: 891 divided by B must be a three-digit integer.\n\nLet me compute 891 / B for B=1 to 9.\n\nB=1: 891 \u2192 MAD=891 \u2192 but then E=1, so BE would be 11. But BE is a two-digit number, so that's allowed. But wait, let's see if that fits.\n\nBut let's think about the sum:\n\nMAD (891) + R A 1 0 (8910) = 891 + 8910 = 9801.\n\nWait, but the sum is AMID, which is A M I D = 9 M 0 D.\n\nSo 9801 should be 9 M 0 D.\n\nSo 9 M 0 D = 9801 \u2192 M=8, D=1.\n\nWait, let's check: 9801 is 9 M 0 D \u2192 M=8, D=1.\n\nSo M=8, D=1.\n\nBut earlier, from the partial product, MAD \u00d7 B = 891. So MAD is 891, B=1.\n\nSo BE is 11.\n\nBut wait, let's check if all letters are correctly assigned.\n\nSo far, the assignments are:\n\nE=1, A=9, I=0, R=8, M=8, D=1, B=1.\n\nWait, but B=1 and E=1, so BE is 11. That's allowed.\n\nBut wait, let's see if the addition is correct.\n\nAdding MAD (891) and RA10 (8910) gives 9801.\n\nWhich is A M I D \u2192 9 8 0 1.\n\nSo yes, that fits. So AMID is 9801.\n\nSo the digits would be:\n\nM=8, A=9, D=1, B=1, E=1, R=8, I=0.\n\nWait, but R is 8, which is same as M=8. Is that allowed? The problem doesn't say that letters must represent different digits. So that's acceptable.\n\nSo the letters are:\n\nM=8, A=9, D=1, B=1, E=1, R=8, I=0.\n\nNow, the options given are for the digits in the order M, A, D, I.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the options are in the order of the result AMID. Let me check the options.\n\nWait, the question says: 'Decipher the following multiplication table: ... the result is AMID.' The options are A to E, each with four digits. Let me look at the options:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 AMID is 9200.\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 9209.\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 9201.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 9207.\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 9222.\n\nWait, but according to our deduction, AMID is 9801. So the digits are A=9, M=8, I=0, D=1 \u2192 so the number is 9 8 0 1.\n\nBut none of the options match that. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the alignment of the addition. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the sum is R A 1 0 plus MAD equals AMID.\n\nSo R A 1 0 is 8910, and MAD is 891. So adding them gives 9801, which is A M I D = 9801.\n\nBut the options don't have 9801. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps E is not 1. Let me reevaluate.\n\nWait, the initial step was assuming that E=1 because MAD \u00d7 E = MAD. But that's only if E=1. But what if E is another digit, and the multiplication leads to a carryover that results in the same digits? That's possible if E=1, but maybe E is a different digit.\n\nWait, but if E is another digit, say E=5, then MAD \u00d75 = MAD. That would imply that 5\u00d7MAD = MAD \u2192 4\u00d7MAD=0 \u2192 MAD=0, which is impossible since it's a three-digit number.\n\nSo E must be 1. So the initial assumption holds.\n\nBut then, why do the options not include 9801? Did I make a mistake elsewhere?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the alignment of the multiplication. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe multiplication is:\n\n   MAD\n\u00d7  BE\n-------\n    MAD (this is MAD \u00d7 E)\n  RA E (this is MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one)\n-------\nAMID\n\nWait, RA E is a three-digit number. So when you add MAD (three digits) and RA E (three digits, but shifted left by one \u2192 four digits?), the sum is AMID, a four-digit number.\n\nWait, perhaps RA E is shifted left, making it a four-digit number. So the addition is:\n\nMAD (three digits) + RA E shifted left by one (four digits) \u2192 sum is four digits.\n\nSo let's write it as:\n\nRA E shifted left by one \u2192 R A E 0.\n\nWait, no, because shifting left by one would add a zero at the end. So if RA E is a three-digit number, shifting left would make it R A E 0.\n\nSo the addition is:\n\n    MAD\n+ R A E 0\n---------\nAMID\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because adding a three-digit number to a four-digit number would give a four-digit number, which is AMID.\n\nWait, but in the multiplication, the second partial product is MAD \u00d7 B, which is RA E, and then shifted left by one, making it RA E 0.\n\nSo the addition is MAD (three digits) + RA E 0 (four digits) = AMID (four digits).\n\nSo the sum is:\n\nR A E 0\n+    M A D\n= A M I D\n\nWait, but that can't be correct because R A E 0 is a four-digit number, and adding MAD (three digits) would mean that the sum is a four-digit number starting with R or R+carry.\n\nWait, but the sum is AMID, which starts with A. So perhaps R is less than or equal to A, considering any carryover.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try another approach.\n\nSince E must be 1, let's proceed again.\n\nSo E=1. Then, the multiplication becomes:\n\n   MAD\n\u00d7   B1\n------------\n    MAD (MAD \u00d7 1)\n  R A 1 (MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one)\n------------\nAMID\n\nSo adding MAD and R A 1 0 (since shifting left by one adds a zero at the end) gives AMID.\n\nSo:\n\n   R A 1 0\n+     M A D\n= A M I D\n\nNow, let's add these numbers digit by digit.\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n0 + D = D \u2192 okay.\n\nTens place: 1 + A = I \u2192 I = A +1, or I = A +1 -10 if there's a carry. But let's see.\n\nHundreds place: A + M + carry_from_tens = I (but wait, the sum's hundreds digit is M, not I. Wait, no. Let me think about the sum's digits.\n\nWait, the sum is A M I D. So:\n\nThousands place: R + carry_from_hundreds = A.\n\nHundreds place: A (from R A 1 0) + M (from MAD) + carry_from_tens = M.\n\nTens place: 1 (from R A 1 0) + A (from MAD) = I.\n\nUnits place: 0 + D = D.\n\nWait, so let's write the equations:\n\n1. Units: 0 + D = D \u2192 no issue.\n\n2. Tens: 1 + A = I + 10 * carry1 (carry1 is 0 or 1).\n\n3. Hundreds: A (from RA10) + M (from MAD) + carry1 = M + 10 * carry2.\n\n4. Thousands: R + carry2 = A.\n\nAlso, since the sum is A M I D, the thousands digit is A, so R + carry2 must equal A.\n\nLet me analyze equation 3:\n\nA + M + carry1 = M + 10 * carry2 \u2192 A + carry1 = 10 * carry2.\n\nSince A is a digit (0-9), and carry1 can be 0 or 1, and carry2 can be 0 or 1.\n\nSo possible cases:\n\nCase 1: carry2 = 1.\n\nThen, A + carry1 = 10.\n\nSince carry1 can be 0 or 1, A must be 9 or 10. But A is a digit, so A=9 and carry1=1.\n\nCase 2: carry2 = 0.\n\nThen, A + carry1 = 0 \u2192 which is impossible since A is a digit (\u22650) and carry1 is 0 or 1.\n\nSo only case 1 is possible.\n\nSo A=9, carry1=1, carry2=1.\n\nNow, equation 2: 1 + A = I + 10 * carry1.\n\nA=9, carry1=1 \u2192 1+9 = I +10 \u2192 10 = I +10 \u2192 I=0.\n\nEquation 4: R + carry2 = A \u2192 R + 1 =9 \u2192 R=8.\n\nSo now, R=8, A=9, I=0, carry1=1, carry2=1.\n\nNow, equation 3 is satisfied because 9 + carry1 (1) =10 \u2192 carry2=1.\n\nNow, the sum is:\n\nRA10 \u2192 R=8, A=9, E=1 \u2192 RA10 = 8910.\n\nMAD is a three-digit number: M A D = M 9 D.\n\nAdding 8910 + MAD = AMID \u2192 which is A=9, M, I=0, D.\n\nSo 8910 + MAD = 9 M 0 D.\n\nBut MAD is M 9 D, a three-digit number.\n\nSo 8910 + (100*M +90 + D) = 9000 + 100*M + 0*10 + D.\n\nLet me compute 8910 + 100*M +90 + D = 9000 + 100*M + D.\n\nWait, simplifying:\n\n8910 + 100M +90 + D = 9000 + 100M + D.\n\nSubtract 100M and D from both sides:\n\n8910 +90 = 9000 \u2192 9000 = 9000.\n\nHmm, that's an identity, which doesn't give any new information. So perhaps I need to find M and D such that when I add 8910 and MAD, I get 9M0D.\n\nWait, let's write this as:\n\n8910 + (100*M + 90 + D) = 9000 + 100*M + 0 + D.\n\nWait, but that's:\n\n(8910 + 90) + 100M + D = 9000 + 100M + D.\n\nWhich simplifies to 9000 + 100M + D = 9000 + 100M + D. Which is always true.\n\nSo this doesn't help us find M and D. Hmm.\n\nBut from the partial product, MAD \u00d7 B = RA1 = 891.\n\nSo MAD \u00d7 B = 891.\n\nBut B is the tens digit of BE, which is a two-digit number. So B can be 1-9.\n\nSo MAD \u00d7 B = 891 \u2192 MAD = 891 / B.\n\nSince MAD is a three-digit integer, 891 must be divisible by B.\n\nLet's find possible values of B where 891 \u00f7 B is an integer and MAD is a three-digit number.\n\nCompute 891 \u00f7 B for B=1 to 9:\n\nB=1 \u2192 891 \u2192 MAD=891.\n\nB=3 \u2192 891 \u00f73=297 \u2192 MAD=297.\n\nB=9 \u2192 891 \u00f79=99 \u2192 which is two-digit, so invalid.\n\nWait, B=3: MAD=297.\n\nCheck if B=3 is valid.\n\nSo B=3, MAD=297.\n\nThen, BE is 31 (B=3, E=1).\n\nNow, let's see if the addition holds.\n\nMAD = 297.\n\nRA10 = 8910.\n\nSum: 8910 + 297 = 9207.\n\nWhich should be AMID = 9 M 0 D.\n\nSo 9207 = 9 M 0 D \u2192 M=2, D=7.\n\nSo M=2, D=7.\n\nSo now, the digits are:\n\nM=2, A=9, D=7, B=3, E=1, R=8, I=0.\n\nNow, let's check if all the conditions are met.\n\nMAD = 297.\n\nBE = 31.\n\n297 \u00d7 31 = ?\n\nCalculate 297 \u00d7 30 = 8910, 297 \u00d71=297. So 8910 +297=9207.\n\nWhich is AMID=9207.\n\nWhich is A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7 \u2192 9207.\n\nSo AMID is 9207. Looking back at the options:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 9200.\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 9209.\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 9201.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 9207.\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 9222.\n\nSo option D is 9207, which matches our calculation.\n\nSo the correct option is D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves deciphering a multiplication table where the three-digit number **MAD** is multiplied by the two-digit number **BE**, resulting in the four-digit number **AMID**.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this multiplication table puzzle here, and I'm supposed to figure out which option is the correct one. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nThe problem looks like a vertical multiplication setup. Here's what the table shows:\n\n   M A D\n\u00d7   B E\n------------\n   M A D\n R A E\n------------\nA M I D\n\nHmm, so it's a multiplication of a three-digit number MAD by a two-digit number BE, resulting in a four-digit number AMID. The intermediate steps are MAD and RA E, which probably comes from MAD multiplied by E, and then another line from MAD multiplied by B (maybe shifted one position to the left). Then adding those together gives AMID.\n\nLet me think about the structure. The multiplication is likely:\n\n   MAD\n\u00d7   BE\n-------\n    MAD  (this is MAD \u00d7 E)\n  RA E   (this is MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one)\n-------\nAMID\n\nWait, but RA E is a three-digit number, which when added to MAD (a three-digit number) would give a four-digit number AMID. So when you add MAD (three digits) and RA E (three digits, but shifted), the sum must be four digits.\n\nLet me think about the digits. Let's denote each letter as a digit. So M, A, D, B, E, R, I are digits. Also, since MAD is a three-digit number, M can't be zero. Similarly, BE is a two-digit number, so B can't be zero.\n\nLooking at the multiplication, perhaps E is the units digit of BE, and B is the tens digit. So when you multiply MAD by E, you get MAD, which is a three-digit number. Wait, that's interesting because multiplying a three-digit number by a single digit (E) gives the same three-digit number. That can only happen if E is 1 because any number multiplied by 1 is itself. So E must be 1.\n\nWait, but looking at the multiplication, when you multiply MAD by E, the result is MAD. So E must be 1. Let me write that down: E = 1.\n\nSo now, the multiplication becomes:\n\n   MAD\n\u00d7   B1\n-------\n    MAD  (from MAD \u00d7 1)\n  R A 1  (from MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one)\n-------\nAMID\n\nWait, but when you multiply MAD by B (the tens digit), you get a three-digit number R A 1. Because B is in the tens place, multiplying MAD by B would give a number that's shifted left, so when adding, it's equivalent to MAD \u00d7 B \u00d7 10.\n\nSo, the two partial products are MAD and R A 1 \u00d7 10. Adding these together gives AMID.\n\nLet me write the addition:\n\n      MAD\n+  R A 1 0\n----------\n   AMID\n\nWait, but adding MAD and R A 1 0 (which is R A 1 shifted left by one, so it's a four-digit number if R is non-zero). But AMID is four digits, so R A 1 must be a three-digit number such that when shifted left, it's four digits. So R must be non-zero.\n\nWait, but when you add MAD (three digits) to R A 1 0 (four digits), the sum is AMID, which is four digits. So the sum is a four-digit number. Let me think about how the addition works.\n\nLet me denote the digits:\n\nMAD is three digits: M (hundreds), A (tens), D (units).\n\nR A 1 0 is four digits: R (thousands), A (hundreds), 1 (tens), 0 (units).\n\nWait, no. Because when you multiply by B (tens), the result is MAD \u00d7 B, which is a three-digit number R A E, but E is 1, so R A 1. Then, when you shift it left by one, it becomes R A 1 0.\n\nWait, but that would make it a four-digit number. So when adding MAD (three digits) to R A 1 0 (four digits), the sum is AMID (four digits). So the addition is:\n\n      MAD (three digits)\n+ R A 1 0 (four digits)\n= AMID (four digits)\n\nBut how can a three-digit number plus a four-digit number result in a four-digit number? That makes sense. So the four-digit number R A 1 0 is larger than MAD, so when you add them, you get a four-digit number starting with A.\n\nWait, but let me think about the addition:\n\nLet me line them up:\n\n    M A D\n+ R A 1 0\n-----------\nA M I D\n\nWait, that can't be right because the sum's thousands place is A, and the addends are M (hundreds) and R (thousands). So when adding, the thousands place comes from R plus any carry-over from the hundreds addition.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as:\n\nR A 1 0\n+    M A D\n----------\nA M I D\n\nBecause when you add the two partial products, the first is R A 1 0 (four digits) and the second is MAD (three digits), so the alignment is:\n\n   R A 1 0\n+     M A D\n= A M I D\n\nWait, but how does that add up? Let's think about each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n0 (from R A 1 0) + D (from MAD) = D (units place of sum). So 0 + D = D \u2192 no problem, no carry.\n\nTens place: 1 (from R A 1 0) + A (from MAD) = I (tens place of sum). So 1 + A = I. So I = A + 1. But since I is a digit, A must be \u22648, because if A is 9, I would be 10, which is not a single digit. So I = A +1.\n\nHundreds place: A (from R A 1 0) + M (from MAD) = M (hundreds place of sum). So A + M = M + something? Wait, because when adding, there might be a carry from the tens place. Wait, let's see:\n\nTens place sum: 1 + A = I. If 1 + A is less than 10, then I is 1+A and carryover is 0. If 1+A >=10, then I is (1+A) mod 10, and carryover is 1.\n\nSo in the hundreds place:\n\nA (from R A 1 0) + M (from MAD) + carryover (from tens) = I (sum's hundreds digit is I?) Wait, no. Wait, the sum is A M I D. So the thousands digit is A, the hundreds digit is M, the tens is I, units is D.\n\nWait, so when adding R A 1 0 and MAD, the sum is A M I D.\n\nLet me write the addition:\n\nR A 1 0\n+   M A D\n= A M I D\n\nWait, perhaps the alignment is:\n\nR A 1 0\n+   M A D\n= A M I D\n\nSo the units place: 0 + D = D \u2192 okay.\n\nTens place: 1 + A = I \u2192 as before.\n\nHundreds place: A + M = M \u2192 So A + M must equal M plus any carry from the tens place.\n\nWait, so A + M + carry = M + 10 * carry_to_thousands. Let me think.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place of the sum, it's M. So (A + M + carry_from_tens) mod 10 = M.\n\nSo (A + M + carry) mod 10 = M \u2192 A + carry \u2261 0 mod 10. Because A + M + carry = M + 10k \u2192 A + carry = 10k.\n\nSince A is a digit (0-9), and carry can be 0 or 1 (since 1+A can be up to 9+1=10, so carry is 0 or 1), let's see possibilities.\n\nCase 1: carry_from_tens is 0.\n\nThen A = 10k. But A is a digit, so k must be 0 \u2192 A=0. But if A is zero, then in the tens place, 1 + A = 1 = I \u2192 I=1. Also, the thousands place: R + carry_from_hundreds = A.\n\nWait, but let's think about the thousands place. The sum is A in the thousands place, so R (from R A 1 0) plus any carry from the hundreds addition must equal A. So R + carry_from_hundreds = A.\n\nBut if carry_from_tens is 0, then in the hundreds place, A + M = M \u2192 A =0. So A=0. Then, in the tens place, 1 + A = I \u2192 I=1.\n\nNow, thousands place: R + carry_from_hundreds = A. But carry_from_hundreds comes from the hundreds addition: (A + M + carry_from_tens) = M + 10 * carry_from_hundreds.\n\nSince A=0, carry_from_tens is 0, so 0 + M + 0 = M \u2192 no carry. So R = A \u2192 R=0.\n\nBut R can't be zero because R A 1 is a three-digit number, and if R is 0, then RA1 would be 0A1, which is a two-digit number if A is non-zero. Wait, no: RA1 is a three-digit number, so R can't be zero. So R=0 is impossible. So this case leads to a contradiction. So A can't be zero.\n\nCase 2: carry_from_tens is 1.\n\nSo in the hundreds place:\n\nA + M + 1 = M + 10 * carry_from_thousands.\n\nSo A +1 = 10 * carry_from_thousands.\n\nSince A is a digit, A can be 9, with carry_from_thousands being 1. Because 9+1=10 \u2192 0 with carryover 1.\n\nSo A must be 9, and carry_from_thousands is 1.\n\nSo A=9.\n\nNow, in the tens place, 1 + A = I \u2192 1+9=10 \u2192 I=0, and carryover to hundreds is 1.\n\nWait, but I is a digit, so I=0, and carryover is 1.\n\nSo now, in the hundreds place, A + M +1 = M + 10*carry_from_thousands.\n\nSince A=9, it's 9 + M + 1 = M + 10*carry.\n\nSo 10 + M = M + 10*carry.\n\nSubtract M from both sides: 10 = 10*carry \u2192 carry=1.\n\nSo carry_from_thousands is 1.\n\nNow, looking at the thousands place: R + carry_from_thousands = A.\n\nSince carry_from_thousands is 1, R + 1 = A.\n\nBut A is 9, so R +1=9 \u2192 R=8.\n\nSo R=8.\n\nNow, let's summarize what we have so far:\n\nE=1, A=9, I=0, R=8.\n\nNow, the partial products are:\n\nMAD \u00d7 1 = MAD \u2192 that's given.\n\nMAD \u00d7 B = RA1 \u2192 which is 8 9 1.\n\nBecause R is 8, A is 9, E is 1. So MAD \u00d7 B = 891.\n\nWait, so MAD \u00d7 B = 891.\n\nBut MAD is a three-digit number, and B is a single digit. So MAD \u00d7 B = 891.\n\nSo MAD must be 891 divided by B.\n\nBut B is a single digit (since BE is a two-digit number, B can't be zero). So possible B values are 1 to 9.\n\nBut let's see: 891 divided by B must be a three-digit integer.\n\nLet me compute 891 / B for B=1 to 9.\n\nB=1: 891 \u2192 MAD=891 \u2192 but then E=1, so BE would be 11. But BE is a two-digit number, so that's allowed. But wait, let's see if that fits.\n\nBut let's think about the sum:\n\nMAD (891) + R A 1 0 (8910) = 891 + 8910 = 9801.\n\nWait, but the sum is AMID, which is A M I D = 9 M 0 D.\n\nSo 9801 should be 9 M 0 D.\n\nSo 9 M 0 D = 9801 \u2192 M=8, D=1.\n\nWait, let's check: 9801 is 9 M 0 D \u2192 M=8, D=1.\n\nSo M=8, D=1.\n\nBut earlier, from the partial product, MAD \u00d7 B = 891. So MAD is 891, B=1.\n\nSo BE is 11.\n\nBut wait, let's check if all letters are correctly assigned.\n\nSo far, the assignments are:\n\nE=1, A=9, I=0, R=8, M=8, D=1, B=1.\n\nWait, but B=1 and E=1, so BE is 11. That's allowed.\n\nBut wait, let's see if the addition is correct.\n\nAdding MAD (891) and RA10 (8910) gives 9801.\n\nWhich is A M I D \u2192 9 8 0 1.\n\nSo yes, that fits. So AMID is 9801.\n\nSo the digits would be:\n\nM=8, A=9, D=1, B=1, E=1, R=8, I=0.\n\nWait, but R is 8, which is same as M=8. Is that allowed? The problem doesn't say that letters must represent different digits. So that's acceptable.\n\nSo the letters are:\n\nM=8, A=9, D=1, B=1, E=1, R=8, I=0.\n\nNow, the options given are for the digits in the order M, A, D, I.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the options are in the order of the result AMID. Let me check the options.\n\nWait, the question says: 'Decipher the following multiplication table: ... the result is AMID.' The options are A to E, each with four digits. Let me look at the options:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 AMID is 9200.\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 9209.\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 9201.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 9207.\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 9222.\n\nWait, but according to our deduction, AMID is 9801. So the digits are A=9, M=8, I=0, D=1 \u2192 so the number is 9 8 0 1.\n\nBut none of the options match that. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the alignment of the addition. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the sum is R A 1 0 plus MAD equals AMID.\n\nSo R A 1 0 is 8910, and MAD is 891. So adding them gives 9801, which is A M I D = 9801.\n\nBut the options don't have 9801. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps E is not 1. Let me reevaluate.\n\nWait, the initial step was assuming that E=1 because MAD \u00d7 E = MAD. But that's only if E=1. But what if E is another digit, and the multiplication leads to a carryover that results in the same digits? That's possible if E=1, but maybe E is a different digit.\n\nWait, but if E is another digit, say E=5, then MAD \u00d75 = MAD. That would imply that 5\u00d7MAD = MAD \u2192 4\u00d7MAD=0 \u2192 MAD=0, which is impossible since it's a three-digit number.\n\nSo E must be 1. So the initial assumption holds.\n\nBut then, why do the options not include 9801? Did I make a mistake elsewhere?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the alignment of the multiplication. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe multiplication is:\n\n   MAD\n\u00d7  BE\n-------\n    MAD (this is MAD \u00d7 E)\n  RA E (this is MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one)\n-------\nAMID\n\nWait, RA E is a three-digit number. So when you add MAD (three digits) and RA E (three digits, but shifted left by one \u2192 four digits?), the sum is AMID, a four-digit number.\n\nWait, perhaps RA E is shifted left, making it a four-digit number. So the addition is:\n\nMAD (three digits) + RA E shifted left by one (four digits) \u2192 sum is four digits.\n\nSo let's write it as:\n\nRA E shifted left by one \u2192 R A E 0.\n\nWait, no, because shifting left by one would add a zero at the end. So if RA E is a three-digit number, shifting left would make it R A E 0.\n\nSo the addition is:\n\n    MAD\n+ R A E 0\n---------\nAMID\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because adding a three-digit number to a four-digit number would give a four-digit number, which is AMID.\n\nWait, but in the multiplication, the second partial product is MAD \u00d7 B, which is RA E, and then shifted left by one, making it RA E 0.\n\nSo the addition is MAD (three digits) + RA E 0 (four digits) = AMID (four digits).\n\nSo the sum is:\n\nR A E 0\n+    M A D\n= A M I D\n\nWait, but that can't be correct because R A E 0 is a four-digit number, and adding MAD (three digits) would mean that the sum is a four-digit number starting with R or R+carry.\n\nWait, but the sum is AMID, which starts with A. So perhaps R is less than or equal to A, considering any carryover.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try another approach.\n\nSince E must be 1, let's proceed again.\n\nSo E=1. Then, the multiplication becomes:\n\n   MAD\n\u00d7   B1\n------------\n    MAD (MAD \u00d7 1)\n  R A 1 (MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one)\n------------\nAMID\n\nSo adding MAD and R A 1 0 (since shifting left by one adds a zero at the end) gives AMID.\n\nSo:\n\n   R A 1 0\n+     M A D\n= A M I D\n\nNow, let's add these numbers digit by digit.\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n0 + D = D \u2192 okay.\n\nTens place: 1 + A = I \u2192 I = A +1, or I = A +1 -10 if there's a carry. But let's see.\n\nHundreds place: A + M + carry_from_tens = I (but wait, the sum's hundreds digit is M, not I. Wait, no. Let me think about the sum's digits.\n\nWait, the sum is A M I D. So:\n\nThousands place: R + carry_from_hundreds = A.\n\nHundreds place: A (from R A 1 0) + M (from MAD) + carry_from_tens = M.\n\nTens place: 1 (from R A 1 0) + A (from MAD) = I.\n\nUnits place: 0 + D = D.\n\nWait, so let's write the equations:\n\n1. Units: 0 + D = D \u2192 no issue.\n\n2. Tens: 1 + A = I + 10 * carry1 (carry1 is 0 or 1).\n\n3. Hundreds: A (from RA10) + M (from MAD) + carry1 = M + 10 * carry2.\n\n4. Thousands: R + carry2 = A.\n\nAlso, since the sum is A M I D, the thousands digit is A, so R + carry2 must equal A.\n\nLet me analyze equation 3:\n\nA + M + carry1 = M + 10 * carry2 \u2192 A + carry1 = 10 * carry2.\n\nSince A is a digit (0-9), and carry1 can be 0 or 1, and carry2 can be 0 or 1.\n\nSo possible cases:\n\nCase 1: carry2 = 1.\n\nThen, A + carry1 = 10.\n\nSince carry1 can be 0 or 1, A must be 9 or 10. But A is a digit, so A=9 and carry1=1.\n\nCase 2: carry2 = 0.\n\nThen, A + carry1 = 0 \u2192 which is impossible since A is a digit (\u22650) and carry1 is 0 or 1.\n\nSo only case 1 is possible.\n\nSo A=9, carry1=1, carry2=1.\n\nNow, equation 2: 1 + A = I + 10 * carry1.\n\nA=9, carry1=1 \u2192 1+9 = I +10 \u2192 10 = I +10 \u2192 I=0.\n\nEquation 4: R + carry2 = A \u2192 R + 1 =9 \u2192 R=8.\n\nSo now, R=8, A=9, I=0, carry1=1, carry2=1.\n\nNow, equation 3 is satisfied because 9 + carry1 (1) =10 \u2192 carry2=1.\n\nNow, the sum is:\n\nRA10 \u2192 R=8, A=9, E=1 \u2192 RA10 = 8910.\n\nMAD is a three-digit number: M A D = M 9 D.\n\nAdding 8910 + MAD = AMID \u2192 which is A=9, M, I=0, D.\n\nSo 8910 + MAD = 9 M 0 D.\n\nBut MAD is M 9 D, a three-digit number.\n\nSo 8910 + (100*M +90 + D) = 9000 + 100*M + 0*10 + D.\n\nLet me compute 8910 + 100*M +90 + D = 9000 + 100*M + D.\n\nWait, simplifying:\n\n8910 + 100M +90 + D = 9000 + 100M + D.\n\nSubtract 100M and D from both sides:\n\n8910 +90 = 9000 \u2192 9000 = 9000.\n\nHmm, that's an identity, which doesn't give any new information. So perhaps I need to find M and D such that when I add 8910 and MAD, I get 9M0D.\n\nWait, let's write this as:\n\n8910 + (100*M + 90 + D) = 9000 + 100*M + 0 + D.\n\nWait, but that's:\n\n(8910 + 90) + 100M + D = 9000 + 100M + D.\n\nWhich simplifies to 9000 + 100M + D = 9000 + 100M + D. Which is always true.\n\nSo this doesn't help us find M and D. Hmm.\n\nBut from the partial product, MAD \u00d7 B = RA1 = 891.\n\nSo MAD \u00d7 B = 891.\n\nBut B is the tens digit of BE, which is a two-digit number. So B can be 1-9.\n\nSo MAD \u00d7 B = 891 \u2192 MAD = 891 / B.\n\nSince MAD is a three-digit integer, 891 must be divisible by B.\n\nLet's find possible values of B where 891 \u00f7 B is an integer and MAD is a three-digit number.\n\nCompute 891 \u00f7 B for B=1 to 9:\n\nB=1 \u2192 891 \u2192 MAD=891.\n\nB=3 \u2192 891 \u00f73=297 \u2192 MAD=297.\n\nB=9 \u2192 891 \u00f79=99 \u2192 which is two-digit, so invalid.\n\nWait, B=3: MAD=297.\n\nCheck if B=3 is valid.\n\nSo B=3, MAD=297.\n\nThen, BE is 31 (B=3, E=1).\n\nNow, let's see if the addition holds.\n\nMAD = 297.\n\nRA10 = 8910.\n\nSum: 8910 + 297 = 9207.\n\nWhich should be AMID = 9 M 0 D.\n\nSo 9207 = 9 M 0 D \u2192 M=2, D=7.\n\nSo M=2, D=7.\n\nSo now, the digits are:\n\nM=2, A=9, D=7, B=3, E=1, R=8, I=0.\n\nNow, let's check if all the conditions are met.\n\nMAD = 297.\n\nBE = 31.\n\n297 \u00d7 31 = ?\n\nCalculate 297 \u00d7 30 = 8910, 297 \u00d71=297. So 8910 +297=9207.\n\nWhich is AMID=9207.\n\nWhich is A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7 \u2192 9207.\n\nSo AMID is 9207. Looking back at the options:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 9200.\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 9209.\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 9201.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 9207.\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 9222.\n\nSo option D is 9207, which matches our calculation.\n\nSo the correct option is D.\n\n\nThe problem involves deciphering a multiplication table where the three-digit number **MAD** is multiplied by the two-digit number **BE**, resulting in the four-digit number **AMID**. The intermediate steps are **MAD** (from **MAD \u00d7 E**) and **RAE** (from **MAD \u00d7 B**, shifted left by one). The goal is to determine the correct digits represented by the letters.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **E = 1**: Since **MAD \u00d7 E = MAD**, E must be 1 because any number multiplied by 1 remains unchanged.\n2. **A = 9**: From the addition of the partial products, the hundreds place equation simplifies to **A + M + carry = M + 10 * carry**, leading to **A = 9**.\n3. **I = 0**: From the tens place addition, **1 + A = I + 10 * carry**, and since **A = 9**, this gives **I = 0**.\n4. **R = 8**: From the thousands place addition, **R + carry = A**, and since **A = 9**, this gives **R = 8**.\n5. **MAD \u00d7 B = 891**: From the partial product **RAE = 891**, and since **MAD \u00d7 B = 891**, **MAD** must be **297** when **B = 3**.\n6. **AMID = 9207**: Adding the partial products **8910** (from **MAD \u00d7 B**) and **297** (from **MAD \u00d7 E**) gives **9207**, which matches the structure **A M I D = 9 2 0 7**.\n\n### Verification:\n- **MAD = 297**, **BE = 31**, and **AMID = 9207** satisfy all the given conditions.\n- The digits are assigned as follows: **M = 2**, **A = 9**, **D = 7**, **B = 3**, **E = 1**, **R = 8**, **I = 0**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer corresponds to **AMID = 9207**, which matches option **D**.\n\n**Answer: D**",
