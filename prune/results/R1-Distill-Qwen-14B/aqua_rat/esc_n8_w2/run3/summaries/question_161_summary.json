      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about arranging children in a row and figuring out how many are there. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.\n\nThe problem says: In a row of children, Neha is 12th from the left end, and Radha is 6th from the right end. Then, when Radha is shifted two places to the left and Neha is shifted two places to the right, there are six children between them. I need to find the total number of children in the row.\n\nHmm, let me visualize this. So initially, the row has some number of children, N. Let's denote the positions with numbers. Let's say the left end is position 1, then position 2, and so on until position N on the right end.\n\nNeha is 12th from the left. So her initial position is 12. Radha is 6th from the right, which means her initial position is N - 6 + 1, because the right end is position N. So Radha is at position N-5.\n\nThen, Radha is shifted two places to the left. So her new position is (N-5) - 2 = N-7. And Neha is shifted two places to the right, so her new position is 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nNow, after these shifts, there are six children between them. Wait, when they say six children between, that means the distance between Radha and Neha is seven positions (because the number of children between is one less than the positions apart). Or wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me think: if two people are sitting with k children between them, then the number of positions between them is k+1. Like, if there's 1 child between, they're two positions apart.\n\nWait, the problem says there are six children between them. So the positions are separated by 6 + 1 = 7 positions. So the distance between Radha and Neha after shifting is 7.\n\nBut wait, the direction matters. Are they on the same side or opposite sides after shifting? Let me see.\n\nAfter shifting, Radha is at N-7 and Neha is at 14. So the positions are N-7 and 14.\n\nNow, I need to find the distance between N-7 and 14. The absolute difference between these two positions is |(N-7) - 14| = |N-21|.\n\nBut wait, this distance is supposed to be 7 because there are six children between them. So:\n\n|N - 21| = 7\n\nWhich means N-21 could be 7 or -7.\n\nCase 1: N -21 =7 \u2192 N=28\n\nCase 2: N-21 = -7 \u2192 N=14\n\nBut wait, can N be 14? Let's check.\n\nOriginally, Radha is 6th from the right. So if N=14, her initial position is 14-6+1=9. Then, when she moves two left, she's at 7. But if N is 14, and her new position is 7, and Neha is at 14. So Radha is at 7 and Neha at 14. The distance between them is 14-7=7. So that's 7 positions apart. But the problem says there are six children between them. So 14-7-1 =6. Oh, wait, wait. Because the number of children between is (distance -1). So if the positions are 7 and 14, the number of children between is 14-7-1=6. That fits. So N=14 is a possibility.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the initial positions. If N=14, then Radha's initial position is 9. But if N=14, and she's at 9, then when she shifts two left to 7, and Neha is at 14, the distance is 7, which gives six children in between. So that works. But wait, let's also check if N=28.\n\nIf N=28, then Radha's initial position is 28-6+1=23. Shifting two left, she's at 21. Neha is at 14. So the distance between 21 and 14 is 7 positions. So the number of children between is 7-1=6. That also works.\n\nSo both N=14 and N=28 seem to satisfy the conditions.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The initial positions must make sense. Let's see for N=14.\n\nNeha is 12th from the left. So in a row of 14 children, her position is 12. That's fine because 12 is less than or equal to 14. Radha is 6th from the right. So position 9. Then when Radha moves two left to 7, and Neha moves two right to 14.\n\nIn the shifted positions, Radha is at 7, Neha at 14. So the distance between them is 14-7=7. So the number of children between them is 7-1=6, which matches the problem statement.\n\nBut wait, if N=14, then after shifting, Radha is at 7 and Neha at 14. So when the problem says \"there are six children between Radha and Neha,\" that's correct because from 7 to 14, the positions are 8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Wait, no, the children between are from 8 to 13, which is 6 children. Yes, that works.\n\nBut wait, the options given don't include 14. The options are A)23, B)27, C)26, D)28, E)29. So 28 is an option (D), but 14 isn't. So that suggests that N=28 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, why is 14 not an option? Because the options start from 23. So maybe I made a mistake in considering N=14.\n\nWait, perhaps in the initial setup, when shifting, the positions shouldn't go beyond the ends. For example, in N=14, when Radha is shifted two places to the left from position 9, she goes to 7, which is valid. And Neha moving two to the right from 12 to 14 is also valid.\n\nSo why is N=14 not an option? The options don't include it, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, let's re-express the problem. The number of children between them after shifting is six. So the positions of Radha and Neha after shifting are R and N, and the number of children between is |R - N| -1 =6.\n\nSo |R - N| =7.\n\nR is the new position of Radha: N_radha_initial -2 = (N-6+1) -2 = N-7.\n\nNeha's new position is 12 +2=14.\n\nSo |(N-7) -14| =7.\n\nSo |N -21|=7 \u2192 N=28 or N=14.\n\nBut N must be such that Radha's initial position is N-6+1= N-5, which must be \u22651. So for N=14, N-5=9 \u22651, which is okay.\n\nBut the options don't include 14. So perhaps I have to reevaluate.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the number of children between. Let me think again. If two people are sitting with six children between them, how many positions apart are they?\n\nFor example, positions 1 and 8: between them are 2,3,4,5,6,7 \u2192 six children. So the positions are 7 apart. So the distance between them is 7 positions.\n\nSo the absolute difference between their positions is 7.\n\nSo, in the shifted scenario, the positions of Radha and Neha are R and N, and |R - N|=7.\n\nSo, R = N_radha_new = N_radha_initial -2 = (N-6+1) -2 = N-7.\n\nNeha's new position is 12 + 2 =14.\n\nSo, |(N-7) -14| =7 \u2192 |N-21|=7 \u2192 N=28 or 14.\n\nBut the options are 23,27,26,28,29. So 28 is an option, but 14 isn't. So why can't N=14 be the answer?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let's think about the initial positions.\n\nIn the initial arrangement, the positions are such that Radha is 6th from the right. So in N=14, her initial position is 9. When she moves two left, she's at 7. And Neha is at 12, moving two right to 14.\n\nSo in the shifted positions, they're at 7 and 14. The number of children between is 14-7-1=6, which fits.\n\nBut the problem says when they're shifted, there are six children between. So in that case, N=14 is a valid solution. But why isn't it an option? Because the options don't have 14, so perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial positions of Radha and Neha are such that when they shift, they are on the same side, but maybe in the other case, they are on opposite sides, but that would complicate things.\n\nWait, let's try N=28.\n\nRadha's initial position: 28-6+1=23. After shifting two left, she's at 21.\n\nNeha's initial position:12. After shifting two right, she's at14.\n\nSo positions 21 and14. The distance is 21-14=7. So the number of children between is 7-1=6, which is correct.\n\nSo N=28 is a valid solution.\n\nBut what about N=14?\n\nIn that case, the positions are 7 and14, distance 7, children between 6. Also valid.\n\nBut since the options don't include 14, I must have made a mistake. Wait, perhaps the problem is that when you shift, the positions can't go beyond the row.\n\nWait, if N=14, and Radha is at 23 initially, but wait, no, if N=14, Radha's initial position is 9, as N-6+1=9. So that's fine. Then she shifts to 7, which is okay.\n\nWait, perhaps I should also check if in the shifted positions, the positions are valid.\n\nFor N=14: Radha is at 7, which is within 1 to14. Neha is at14, which is the end. That's okay.\n\nSo both N=14 and N=28 are possible. But since the options don't have 14, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the shifting direction. Let me double-check.\n\nRadha is shifted to the left by two places. So her position decreases by two.\n\nNeha is shifted to the right by two places. So her position increases by two.\n\nSo in the shifted positions, Radha is at (N-6+1) -2 = N-7.\n\nNeha is at 12+2=14.\n\nSo the positions are N-7 and14.\n\nSo the distance is |N-7 -14|= |N-21|=7.\n\nSo N=28 or 14.\n\nBut the options don't have 14, so the correct answer must be 28, which is option D.\n\nWait, but why is N=14 not considered? Because the problem doesn't specify any constraints on the number of children beyond the positions given, but perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, in N=14, the initial positions of Radha is 9, and she shifts two left to 7. That's okay. But if N=14, and after shifting, Radha is at 7 and Neha at14, which are 7 positions apart, giving six children in between. So that's correct.\n\nBut the options don't have 14, so perhaps N=28 is the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the initial positions.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate Radha's initial position.\n\nRadha is 6th from the right end. So her position is (total number of children) -6 +1.\n\nSo for example, if there are N children, her position is N-6+1= N-5.\n\nSo for N=14, position 9. For N=28, position 23.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that when N=14, after shifting, Radha is at 7 and Neha at14. So the number of children between them is 14-7-1=6. Correct. So N=14 works.\n\nBut since 14 is not an option, perhaps I should look for another possibility.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when Radha and Neha are shifted, their new positions must allow for six children between them. But perhaps the direction of the shift matters in terms of their relative positions.\n\nWait, when N=28, after shifting, Radha is at21 and Neha at14. So Radha is to the right of Neha. So the distance between them is21-14=7, which gives six children between. So that's correct.\n\nBut when N=14, after shifting, Radha is at7 and Neha at14. So Radha is to the left of Neha. The distance is14-7=7, which also gives six children between.\n\nSo both cases are possible. But since N=14 is not an option, perhaps the correct answer is 28.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the initial positions must not be overlapping or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps in the initial arrangement, the number of children between them is different, but that doesn't affect the answer because the problem only gives information about their positions after shifting.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the initial number of children between them and see if that affects the total.\n\nWait, initially, Radha is at position N-5, and Neha is at12. So the distance between them initially is |(N-5) -12|=|N-17|.\n\nBut the problem doesn't state anything about their initial positions regarding the number of children between them, so that's not necessary for solving the problem.\n\nSo, back to the options. The options are A)23, B)27, C)26, D)28, E)29.\n\nOnly N=28 is among these options, so that's the answer.\n\nWait, but why is 28 the answer when 14 also works? Because the problem must have a unique solution, and 28 is the only option that fits, I think.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Positions**:  \n   - Neha is 12th from the left end, so her initial position is **12**.  \n   - Radha is 6th from the right end. If the total number of children is \\( N \\), her initial position is \\( N - 6 + 1 = N - 5 \\).\n\n2. **After Shifting**:  \n   - Radha is shifted 2 places to the left, so her new position is \\( (N - 5) - 2 = N - 7 \\).  \n   - Neha is shifted 2 places to the right, so her new position is \\( 12 + 2 = 14 \\).  \n\n3. **Distance Between Radha and Neha After Shifting**:  \n   The problem states there are 6 children between Radha and Neha after shifting.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about arranging children in a row and figuring out how many are there. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.\n\nThe problem says: In a row of children, Neha is 12th from the left end, and Radha is 6th from the right end. Then, when Radha is shifted two places to the left and Neha is shifted two places to the right, there are six children between them. I need to find the total number of children in the row.\n\nHmm, let me visualize this. So initially, the row has some number of children, N. Let's denote the positions with numbers. Let's say the left end is position 1, then position 2, and so on until position N on the right end.\n\nNeha is 12th from the left. So her initial position is 12. Radha is 6th from the right, which means her initial position is N - 6 + 1, because the right end is position N. So Radha is at position N-5.\n\nThen, Radha is shifted two places to the left. So her new position is (N-5) - 2 = N-7. And Neha is shifted two places to the right, so her new position is 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nNow, after these shifts, there are six children between them. Wait, when they say six children between, that means the distance between Radha and Neha is seven positions (because the number of children between is one less than the positions apart). Or wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me think: if two people are sitting with k children between them, then the number of positions between them is k+1. Like, if there's 1 child between, they're two positions apart.\n\nWait, the problem says there are six children between them. So the positions are separated by 6 + 1 = 7 positions. So the distance between Radha and Neha after shifting is 7.\n\nBut wait, the direction matters. Are they on the same side or opposite sides after shifting? Let me see.\n\nAfter shifting, Radha is at N-7 and Neha is at 14. So the positions are N-7 and 14.\n\nNow, I need to find the distance between N-7 and 14. The absolute difference between these two positions is |(N-7) - 14| = |N-21|.\n\nBut wait, this distance is supposed to be 7 because there are six children between them. So:\n\n|N - 21| = 7\n\nWhich means N-21 could be 7 or -7.\n\nCase 1: N -21 =7 \u2192 N=28\n\nCase 2: N-21 = -7 \u2192 N=14\n\nBut wait, can N be 14? Let's check.\n\nOriginally, Radha is 6th from the right. So if N=14, her initial position is 14-6+1=9. Then, when she moves two left, she's at 7. But if N is 14, and her new position is 7, and Neha is at 14. So Radha is at 7 and Neha at 14. The distance between them is 14-7=7. So that's 7 positions apart. But the problem says there are six children between them. So 14-7-1 =6. Oh, wait, wait. Because the number of children between is (distance -1). So if the positions are 7 and 14, the number of children between is 14-7-1=6. That fits. So N=14 is a possibility.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the initial positions. If N=14, then Radha's initial position is 9. But if N=14, and she's at 9, then when she shifts two left to 7, and Neha is at 14, the distance is 7, which gives six children in between. So that works. But wait, let's also check if N=28.\n\nIf N=28, then Radha's initial position is 28-6+1=23. Shifting two left, she's at 21. Neha is at 14. So the distance between 21 and 14 is 7 positions. So the number of children between is 7-1=6. That also works.\n\nSo both N=14 and N=28 seem to satisfy the conditions.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The initial positions must make sense. Let's see for N=14.\n\nNeha is 12th from the left. So in a row of 14 children, her position is 12. That's fine because 12 is less than or equal to 14. Radha is 6th from the right. So position 9. Then when Radha moves two left to 7, and Neha moves two right to 14.\n\nIn the shifted positions, Radha is at 7, Neha at 14. So the distance between them is 14-7=7. So the number of children between them is 7-1=6, which matches the problem statement.\n\nBut wait, if N=14, then after shifting, Radha is at 7 and Neha at 14. So when the problem says \"there are six children between Radha and Neha,\" that's correct because from 7 to 14, the positions are 8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Wait, no, the children between are from 8 to 13, which is 6 children. Yes, that works.\n\nBut wait, the options given don't include 14. The options are A)23, B)27, C)26, D)28, E)29. So 28 is an option (D), but 14 isn't. So that suggests that N=28 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, why is 14 not an option? Because the options start from 23. So maybe I made a mistake in considering N=14.\n\nWait, perhaps in the initial setup, when shifting, the positions shouldn't go beyond the ends. For example, in N=14, when Radha is shifted two places to the left from position 9, she goes to 7, which is valid. And Neha moving two to the right from 12 to 14 is also valid.\n\nSo why is N=14 not an option? The options don't include it, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, let's re-express the problem. The number of children between them after shifting is six. So the positions of Radha and Neha after shifting are R and N, and the number of children between is |R - N| -1 =6.\n\nSo |R - N| =7.\n\nR is the new position of Radha: N_radha_initial -2 = (N-6+1) -2 = N-7.\n\nNeha's new position is 12 +2=14.\n\nSo |(N-7) -14| =7.\n\nSo |N -21|=7 \u2192 N=28 or N=14.\n\nBut N must be such that Radha's initial position is N-6+1= N-5, which must be \u22651. So for N=14, N-5=9 \u22651, which is okay.\n\nBut the options don't include 14. So perhaps I have to reevaluate.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the number of children between. Let me think again. If two people are sitting with six children between them, how many positions apart are they?\n\nFor example, positions 1 and 8: between them are 2,3,4,5,6,7 \u2192 six children. So the positions are 7 apart. So the distance between them is 7 positions.\n\nSo the absolute difference between their positions is 7.\n\nSo, in the shifted scenario, the positions of Radha and Neha are R and N, and |R - N|=7.\n\nSo, R = N_radha_new = N_radha_initial -2 = (N-6+1) -2 = N-7.\n\nNeha's new position is 12 + 2 =14.\n\nSo, |(N-7) -14| =7 \u2192 |N-21|=7 \u2192 N=28 or 14.\n\nBut the options are 23,27,26,28,29. So 28 is an option, but 14 isn't. So why can't N=14 be the answer?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let's think about the initial positions.\n\nIn the initial arrangement, the positions are such that Radha is 6th from the right. So in N=14, her initial position is 9. When she moves two left, she's at 7. And Neha is at 12, moving two right to 14.\n\nSo in the shifted positions, they're at 7 and 14. The number of children between is 14-7-1=6, which fits.\n\nBut the problem says when they're shifted, there are six children between. So in that case, N=14 is a valid solution. But why isn't it an option? Because the options don't have 14, so perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial positions of Radha and Neha are such that when they shift, they are on the same side, but maybe in the other case, they are on opposite sides, but that would complicate things.\n\nWait, let's try N=28.\n\nRadha's initial position: 28-6+1=23. After shifting two left, she's at 21.\n\nNeha's initial position:12. After shifting two right, she's at14.\n\nSo positions 21 and14. The distance is 21-14=7. So the number of children between is 7-1=6, which is correct.\n\nSo N=28 is a valid solution.\n\nBut what about N=14?\n\nIn that case, the positions are 7 and14, distance 7, children between 6. Also valid.\n\nBut since the options don't include 14, I must have made a mistake. Wait, perhaps the problem is that when you shift, the positions can't go beyond the row.\n\nWait, if N=14, and Radha is at 23 initially, but wait, no, if N=14, Radha's initial position is 9, as N-6+1=9. So that's fine. Then she shifts to 7, which is okay.\n\nWait, perhaps I should also check if in the shifted positions, the positions are valid.\n\nFor N=14: Radha is at 7, which is within 1 to14. Neha is at14, which is the end. That's okay.\n\nSo both N=14 and N=28 are possible. But since the options don't have 14, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the shifting direction. Let me double-check.\n\nRadha is shifted to the left by two places. So her position decreases by two.\n\nNeha is shifted to the right by two places. So her position increases by two.\n\nSo in the shifted positions, Radha is at (N-6+1) -2 = N-7.\n\nNeha is at 12+2=14.\n\nSo the positions are N-7 and14.\n\nSo the distance is |N-7 -14|= |N-21|=7.\n\nSo N=28 or 14.\n\nBut the options don't have 14, so the correct answer must be 28, which is option D.\n\nWait, but why is N=14 not considered? Because the problem doesn't specify any constraints on the number of children beyond the positions given, but perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, in N=14, the initial positions of Radha is 9, and she shifts two left to 7. That's okay. But if N=14, and after shifting, Radha is at 7 and Neha at14, which are 7 positions apart, giving six children in between. So that's correct.\n\nBut the options don't have 14, so perhaps N=28 is the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the initial positions.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate Radha's initial position.\n\nRadha is 6th from the right end. So her position is (total number of children) -6 +1.\n\nSo for example, if there are N children, her position is N-6+1= N-5.\n\nSo for N=14, position 9. For N=28, position 23.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that when N=14, after shifting, Radha is at 7 and Neha at14. So the number of children between them is 14-7-1=6. Correct. So N=14 works.\n\nBut since 14 is not an option, perhaps I should look for another possibility.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when Radha and Neha are shifted, their new positions must allow for six children between them. But perhaps the direction of the shift matters in terms of their relative positions.\n\nWait, when N=28, after shifting, Radha is at21 and Neha at14. So Radha is to the right of Neha. So the distance between them is21-14=7, which gives six children between. So that's correct.\n\nBut when N=14, after shifting, Radha is at7 and Neha at14. So Radha is to the left of Neha. The distance is14-7=7, which also gives six children between.\n\nSo both cases are possible. But since N=14 is not an option, perhaps the correct answer is 28.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the initial positions must not be overlapping or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps in the initial arrangement, the number of children between them is different, but that doesn't affect the answer because the problem only gives information about their positions after shifting.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the initial number of children between them and see if that affects the total.\n\nWait, initially, Radha is at position N-5, and Neha is at12. So the distance between them initially is |(N-5) -12|=|N-17|.\n\nBut the problem doesn't state anything about their initial positions regarding the number of children between them, so that's not necessary for solving the problem.\n\nSo, back to the options. The options are A)23, B)27, C)26, D)28, E)29.\n\nOnly N=28 is among these options, so that's the answer.\n\nWait, but why is 28 the answer when 14 also works? Because the problem must have a unique solution, and 28 is the only option that fits, I think.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Positions**:  \n   - Neha is 12th from the left end, so her initial position is **12**.  \n   - Radha is 6th from the right end. If the total number of children is \\( N \\), her initial position is \\( N - 6 + 1 = N - 5 \\).\n\n2. **After Shifting**:  \n   - Radha is shifted 2 places to the left, so her new position is \\( (N - 5) - 2 = N - 7 \\).  \n   - Neha is shifted 2 places to the right, so her new position is \\( 12 + 2 = 14 \\).  \n\n3. **Distance Between Radha and Neha After Shifting**:  \n   The problem states there are 6 children between Radha and Neha after shifting. This means the distance between them is \\( 6 + 1 = 7 \\) positions.  \n   The absolute difference between their new positions is:  \n   \\[\n   |(N - 7) - 14| = |N - 21| = 7\n   \\]  \n   This gives two possible solutions:  \n   - \\( N - 21 = 7 \\implies N = 28 \\)  \n   - \\( N - 21 = -7 \\implies N = 14 \\)\n\n4. **Validation of Solutions**:  \n   - For \\( N = 28 \\):  \n     - Radha's initial position is \\( 28 - 5 = 23 \\). After shifting, she is at \\( 23 - 2 = 21 \\).  \n     - Neha's initial position is \\( 12 \\). After shifting, she is at \\( 12 + 2 = 14 \\).  \n     - The distance between them is \\( |21 - 14| = 7 \\), which matches the condition of 6 children between them.  \n\n   - For \\( N = 14 \\):  \n     - Radha's initial position is \\( 14 - 5 = 9 \\). After shifting, she is at \\( 9 - 2 = 7 \\).  \n     - Neha's initial position is \\( 12 \\). After shifting, she is at \\( 12 + 2 = 14 \\).  \n     - The distance between them is \\( |14 - 7| = 7 \\), which also matches the condition of 6 children between them.  \n\n5. **Conclusion**:  \n   Both \\( N = 28 \\) and \\( N = 14 \\) satisfy the conditions. However, since the options provided are \\( 23, 27, 26, 28, 29 \\), and \\( 14 \\) is not among them, the correct answer must be \\( N = 28 \\).\n\n**Answer: D**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about children standing in a row, and I need to figure out how many there are in total. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says Neha is 12th from the left end. That means if I count from the left, she's the 12th person. So her position is 12.\n\nThen, Radha is 6th from the right end. Hmm, that means from the right side, she's the sixth. So if there are N children in total, Radha's position from the left would be N - 6 + 1. Because if you're 6th from the end, you're (total -6 +1)th from the other end. Wait, let me think about that again. Let's say there are 10 kids. If someone is 3rd from the right, they're 8th from the left because 10-3+1=8. Yeah, that's right. So Radha's original position is N -6 +1, which simplifies to N-5.\n\nNow, the problem says Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places. So her new position is (N-5) -2 = N-7. And Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places, so her new position is 12 + 2 =14.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, when you move left, your position number decreases, right? Because moving left in the row means you're closer to the left end. So if Radha was at position N-5, moving her two places left would make her position (N-5) -2 = N-7.\n\nSimilarly, moving right increases your position number. So from 12, moving two places to the right makes her 14.\n\nNow, after shifting, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha. So the distance between them is 6. But wait, how do we calculate the positions to get that?\n\nThe positions are Radha at N-7 and Neha at 14. Now, the number of children between them depends on their relative positions. Let's think: if Radha is to the left of Neha, then the number of children between them is (Neha's position) - (Radha's position) -1. Because, for example, if someone is at position 3 and another at 6, the children in between are 4 and 5, which is 2 children, and 6-3-1=2.\n\nBut wait, what if Radha is to the right of Neha after shifting? Then it would be (Radha's position - Neha's position -1). But in this case, after shifting, let's see where they are. Let me consider the possibilities.\n\nWait, let's think about Radha's new position (N-7) and Neha's new position (14). Are these positions such that Radha is before or after Neha? Let's see.\n\nIf N-7 <14, then Radha is to the left of Neha. Then the number of children between them is 14 - (N-7) -1 = 14 - N +7 -1 = 20 - N.\n\nBut the problem states that after shifting, there are 6 children between them. So:\n\nIf Radha is to the left of Neha, then 20 - N =6 \u2192 N=14. But wait, that can't be possible because Radha's original position was N-5. If N=14, then Radha was at 14-5=9th position from the left. That's possible. But let's check the other possibility.\n\nAlternatively, if Radha is to the right of Neha, then the number of children between them is (N-7) -14 -1 = N-7 -14 -1 = N -22.\n\nSet that equal to 6: N-22=6 \u2192 N=28.\n\nWait, but let's check if Radha is to the right of Neha. That would require that N-7 >14 \u2192 N>21.\n\nSo N could be 28, which is one of the options. Let's see if that makes sense.\n\nLet me plug N=28 into the positions.\n\nOriginal positions:\nNeha is 12th from left.\n\nRadha is 6th from right. So her original position is 28-5=23rd from left.\n\nAfter shifting:\nRadha moves left by 2 \u2192 23-2=21st position.\n\nNeha moves right by 2 \u2192 12+2=14th position.\n\nWait, but 21 is greater than 14. So Radha is to the right of Neha. So the number of children between them is 21 -14 -1 =6. Which matches the condition.\n\nSo N is 28. Let me check the options. Option D is 28.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recount.\n\nTotal children: 28.\n\nNeha's original position: 12 from left.\n\nRadha's original position: 6 from right \u2192 28-6+1=23 from left.\n\nAfter shift: Radha moves left by 2 \u2192 23-2=21.\n\nNeha moves right by 2 \u2192 12+2=14.\n\nSo Radha is at 21, Neha at 14. So Radha is to the right. The number between them is 21-14-1=6. Correct.\n\nSo the total number is 28, which is option D.\n",
