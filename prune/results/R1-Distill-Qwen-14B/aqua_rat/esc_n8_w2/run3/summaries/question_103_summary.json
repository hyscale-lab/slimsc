      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says, \"M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. D. If 3 men drop out, how much more will each have to contribute towards the purchase of the gift?\" The options are given as A to E, and I need to pick the correct one.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. Initially, there are M men sharing the cost D. So each man's initial contribution would be D divided by M, right? So that's D/M per person.\n\nNow, 3 men drop out. That means the number of men remaining is M minus 3. So the new number of people sharing the cost is M-3. The total cost D remains the same, so each person now has to pay D divided by (M-3). So the new contribution per person is D/(M-3).\n\nThe question is asking how much more each will have to contribute. So I need to find the difference between the new contribution and the original one. Let me write that down:\n\nDifference = New contribution - Original contribution\nDifference = (D/(M-3)) - (D/M)\n\nHmm, let's compute this difference. To subtract these two fractions, they need a common denominator. The denominators are (M-3) and M, so the common denominator would be M*(M-3). Let me rewrite both fractions:\n\n(D/(M-3)) = D*M / (M*(M-3))\n(D/M) = D*(M-3) / (M*(M-3))\n\nSo subtracting them:\n\nDifference = [D*M - D*(M-3)] / (M*(M-3))\n\nLet me expand the numerator:\n\nD*M - D*(M-3) = D*M - D*M + 3D = 3D\n\nSo the numerator is 3D, and the denominator is M*(M-3). So the difference becomes:\n\n3D / [M*(M-3)] \n\nWait, looking at the options, let me check each one. Option D is 3D/(M\u00b2 -3M). Oh, because M*(M-3) is M\u00b2 -3M. So that's the same as 3D/(M\u00b2 -3M), which is option D.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So the initial per person is D/M, after 3 drop, it's D/(M-3). The extra each has to pay is the difference, which we calculated as 3D/(M(M-3)).\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA) D/(M-3) \u2192 That's the new contribution, not the increase.\nB) MD/3 \u2192 That doesn't look like our result.\nC) M/(D-3) \u2192 Doesn't match.\nD) 3D/(M\u00b2-3M) \u2192 Which is same as 3D/(M(M-3)), so yes, this matches.\nE) None of these.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D. But wait, let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, original: D/M. After 3 drop, D/(M-3). The extra per person is D/(M-3) - D/M.\n\nCompute that: [D*M - D*(M-3)] / [M(M-3)] \u2192 [DM - DM +3D] \u2192 3D in numerator. So 3D/(M(M-3)) which is option D.\n\nYes, so the correct answer is D.\n",

Then, 3 men drop out, and we need to find out how much more each of the remaining men will have to contribute. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.\n\nHmm, okay. So, first, let me break down the problem. Initially, there are M men contributing equally to buy a gift that costs D rupees. So each man's share would be the total amount divided by the number of men, right? So, the initial contribution per man is D divided by M. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the problem says 3 men drop out. So, the number of men remaining is M minus 3. But the total cost of the gift doesn't change, right? It's still Rs. D. So, the new contribution per man would be D divided by (M-3). \n\nWait, but the question is asking how much more each man will have to contribute.
