      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question says that when you divide 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, you get the same remainder. Then, I need to find the sum of the digits of N. The options are A)10, B)11, C)12, D)13, E)14.\n\nHmm, alright. I remember that when two numbers are divided by the same divisor and leave the same remainder, the difference between those two numbers is a multiple of the divisor. So, if I subtract 875 from 2272, that should give me a number that's a multiple of N. Let me do that calculation.\n\n2272 minus 875. Let's see, 2272 minus 800 is 1472, then minus 75 is 1397. So, 2272 - 875 = 1397. That means N must be a divisor of 1397.\n\nBut wait, N is a 3-digit number. So, I need to find the 3-digit divisors of 1397. Once I find them, I can check which one fits the original condition.\n\nFirst, I should factorize 1397 to find all its divisors. Let's start by checking small prime factors.\n\nIs 1397 even? No, so 2 is out. Let's check 3: sum of digits is 1+3+9+7=20, which isn't divisible by 3, so 3 isn't a factor. Next, 5: it doesn't end with 0 or 5, so no. How about 7? Let's do 1397 divided by 7.\n\n7 into 13 is 1, remainder 6. Bring down 9 to make 69. 7*9=63, so remainder 6. Bring down 7: 67. 7*9=63, remainder 4. So 1397 divided by 7 is 199 with a remainder of 4. So 7 isn't a factor.\n\nNext, try 11. The rule for 11 is alternating sum. (1 + 9) - (3 +7) = (10) - (10) =0. Oh, that's divisible by 11. So 1397 divided by 11 is 127. Let me check that: 11*127. 11*120=1320, 11*7=77, so 1320+77=1397. Yes, correct. So 1397 = 11 * 127.\n\nWait, so the prime factors of 1397 are 11 and 127. So the divisors are 1, 11, 127, and 1397. But wait, N is a 3-digit number. So possible N candidates are 11 and 127. Wait, 11 is a 2-digit number, and 127 is a 3-digit number. So N must be 127? Because 1397 is a 4-digit number, which is too big for N to be a 3-digit number. So N=127.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not missing any other possible factors. Because 1397 =11 *127. Are 11 and 127 primes? Well, 11 is a prime number. What about 127? Let me check if 127 is prime. Hmm, 127 divided by 2? No. 3? 1+2+7=10, not divisible by 3. 5? Doesn't end with 0 or 5. 7? 7*18 is 126, so 127-126=1, so remainder 1. 11? 11*11=121, 127-121=6. 13? 13*9=117, 13*10=130 which is higher. So 127 is a prime. So the only divisors are 1, 11, 127, and 1397. So N can only be 127 or 1397. But since N is a 3-digit number, 1397 is 4-digit, so N must be 127.\n\nSo N is 127. Now, the sum of the digits: 1 + 2 +7 =10. Wait, but 10 is option A. But wait, let me check if I did everything correctly.\n\nWait, the initial assumption is that 2272 and 875, when divided by N, give the same remainder. So let me verify with N=127.\n\nLet's compute 2272 \u00f7 127. Let's see, 127*17 = 127*10=1270, 127*7=889; 1270+889=2159. Hmm, 2272-2159=113. So the remainder is 113.\n\nNow, 875 \u00f7127. Let's compute 127*6=762. 762 is less than 875. Subtract: 875-762=113. So the remainder is also 113. So yes, both give same remainder. So N=127 is correct.\n\nSo the sum of digits is 1+2+7=10. Which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another possible N. Because 1397 is 11*127, but maybe N is a multiple of 11 and 127? No, because 127 is prime. So the only 3-digit divisor is 127. So N is 127.\n\nSo the answer should be A)10.\n",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: When 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number N, they leave the same remainder. I need to find the sum of the digits of N, and the options are from A to E.\n\nHmm, I remember that when two numbers leave the same remainder when divided by N, it means that the difference between those two numbers is a multiple of N. Oh right, because the remainders are the same, so the difference must be exactly divisible by N.\n\nSo, let's write that down. The difference between 2272 and 875 is 2272 - 875. Let me calculate that. 2272 minus 800 is 1472, minus 75 more is 1397. Wait, no, wait, 2272 - 875: 875 is 800 + 75. So 2272 - 800 is 1472, and then subtract 75: 1472 -75 = 1397. So 2272 -875 = 1397.\n\nSo N must be a divisor of 1397. And N is a 3-digit number. So I need to find all 3-digit divisors of 1397 and then see which one fits.\n\nWait, but first, let me make sure I'm correct. So, if when you divide both numbers by N, the remainder is the same, then 2272 = a*N + r and 875 = b*N + r. Subtracting these, (2272 -875) = (a -b)*N. So yes, N divides 1397.\n\nSo I need to factor 1397 and find its 3-digit factors.\n\nLet me try to factor 1397. Hmm, I can start by checking divisibility by small primes.\n\nFirst, check if it's even: 1397 is odd, so not divisible by 2.\n\nSum of digits: 1+3+9+7 = 20, which isn't divisible by 3, so 3 is out.\n\nEnds with 7, so not divisible by 5.\n\nLet me try dividing by 7: 1397 \u00f7 7. 7*199 is 1393, because 7*200 is 1400, minus 7 is 1393. So 1397 -1393 is 4. So remainder 4. Not divisible by 7.\n\nNext, 11: The rule for 11 is alternating sum. (1 +9) - (3 +7) = (10) - (10) = 0. Oh, that's divisible by 11. So 1397 \u00f711.\n\nLet me compute 1397 divided by 11.\n\n11 * 127 is 1397? Let's see: 11*120=1320, 11*7=77. So 1320+77=1397. Yes, correct. So 1397 = 11 * 127.\n\nNow, are 127 and 11 prime? 11 is a prime. What about 127? Let's check if 127 is prime. It's less than 128, which is 2^7. So I need to check primes up to sqrt(127), which is around 11.27, so primes up to 11.\n\nCheck if 127 is divisible by 2? No, it's odd.\n\n3? 1+2+7=10, not divisible by 3.\n\n5? Doesn't end with 0 or 5.\n\n7? 7*18=126, 127-126=1, so remainder 1. Not divisible.\n\n11? 11*11=121, 127-121=6. Not divisible. So 127 is prime.\n\nSo the factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, and 1397.\n\nBut N is a 3-digit number. So possible N values are 11 and 127? Wait, wait, wait. 11 is a two-digit number. 127 is a three-digit number, right? 127 is 100-199, so yes, 3-digit. What about 1397? That's a four-digit number, so N can't be that.\n\nSo the only possible 3-digit number N is 127.\n\nWait, but wait, 11 is a 2-digit number, so only 127 and 1397 are possible. But 1397 is a four-digit number, so N must be 127.\n\nSo N is 127. Now, the sum of its digits is 1 + 2 + 7 = 10. Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 10, which would be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, the problem says that when you divide 2272 and 875 by N, you get the same remainder. So N must be a 3-digit number, and a divisor of 1397, which is 11*127. So the possible Ns are 11, 127, and 1397. But 11 is two-digit, 1397 is four-digit. So only 127 is a 3-digit divisor.\n\nSo N is 127. Sum of digits: 1+2+7=10. So the answer would be A)10.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, the options are A)10, B)11, C)12, D)13, E)14. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me compute 2272 \u00f7127 and 875 \u00f7127, and see if the remainders are the same.\n\nCalculate 2272 \u00f7127. Let me see: 127*17= 127*10=1270, 127*7=889. So 1270+889=2159. Hmm, 2159 is less than 2272. 2272-2159=113. So 2272=127*17 + 113.\n\nWait, but 127*18 is 127*17 +127=2159+127=2286, which is more than 2272. So the remainder is 2272-2159=113.\n\nNow, 875 \u00f7127. Let's see: 127*6=762. 762 is less than 875. 875-762=113. So the remainder is 113. So both have the same remainder when divided by 127. That checks out.\n\nSo N is 127, sum of digits is 1+2+7=10, which is option A.\n\nWait, but I thought the options didn't have 10 as the correct answer, but in the problem, the options are A)10, B)11, etc. So the correct answer is A)10.

So only 127 is a 3-digit divisor.\n\nSo N is 127. Sum of digits: 1+2+7=10. So the answer would be A)10.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, the options are A)10, B)11, C)12, D)13, E)14. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me compute 2272 \u00f7127 and 875 \u00f7127, and see if the remainders are the same.\n\nCalculate 2272 \u00f7127. Let me see: 127*17= 127*10=1270, 127*7=889. So 1270+889=2159. Hmm, 2159 is less than 2272. 2272-2159=113. So 2272=127*17 + 113.\n\nWait, but 127*18 is 127*17 +127=2159+127=2286, which is more than 2272. So the remainder is 2272-2159=113.\n\nNow, 875 \u00f7127. Let's see: 127*6=762. 762 is less than 875. 875-762=113. So the remainder is 113. So both have the same remainder when divided by 127. That checks out.\n\nSo N is 127, sum of digits is 1+2+7=10, which is option A.\n\nWait, but I thought the options didn't have 10 as the correct answer, but in the problem, the options are A)10, B)11, etc. So the correct answer is A)10. So the sum is 10.\n\n\nWhen two numbers, 2272 and 875, are divided by a 3-digit number \\( N \\), they leave the same remainder. This implies that the difference between the two numbers is a multiple of \\( N \\). The difference is:\n\n\\[\n2272 - 875 = 1397\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( N \\) must be a 3-digit divisor of 1397. Factoring 1397, we find:\n\n\\[\n1397 = 11 \\times 127\n\\]\n\nThe factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, and 1397. Among these, only 127 is a 3-digit number. Therefore, \\( N = 127 \\).\n\nThe sum of the digits of \\( N \\) is:\n\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 7 = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the digits of \\( N \\) is 10, corresponding to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",
