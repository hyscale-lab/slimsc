      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a cow grazing in a field. Let's see what the question is asking. Hmm, a cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14-foot rope. It grazes 10 square feet per day. I need to find out how long it will take to graze the whole field. The options are from 51 to 91 days, in increments of 10.\n\nWait, so the cow is tied to the middle of a field with a rope. That means the area it can graze is a circle, right? Because the rope allows it to move around the center point. The radius of that circle would be the length of the rope, which is 14 feet. Oh wait, but wait\u2014does the rope allow the cow to graze the entire circle? I mean, if the field is big enough, but the problem says it's tethered in the middle. So I think the field is a circular area with a radius of 14 feet because the cow can graze around the center. Or wait, maybe the field is a circle? I'm a bit confused.\n\nNo, wait, the field is just a field, but the cow is tied in the middle with a rope. So the grazing area is a circle with radius 14 feet. So the area the cow can graze is \u03c0r\u00b2. Let me calculate that.\n\nArea = \u03c0 * (14)^2. 14 squared is 196. So \u03c0 * 196 \u2248 3.1416 * 196. Let me compute that. 3 * 196 is 588, 0.1416 * 196 is approximately 27.8736. So total area is about 615.8736 square feet.\n\nWait, but the cow grazes 10 square feet per day. So to find the time, I can divide the total area by the daily grazing rate. So 615.8736 divided by 10 equals approximately 61.587 days. So that's about 61.59 days. Looking at the options, option B is 61 days, option C is 71. So the answer would be approximately 61 days, right?\n\nWait, but wait a second. The question says \"the whole field.\" Oh! I think I assumed the field is circular, but maybe the field isn't a circle. Or perhaps the cow can only graze within the field, meaning that the field's shape might affect how much area the cow can actually graze. Wait, but the problem says the cow is tethered in the middle, so it can graze in a circle. So the field's area is the circle. So my initial calculation holds.\n\nSo the area is about 615.8736 square feet. Divided by 10 sq ft per day gives 61.58 days. So approximately 62 days, but the options are in tens. The closest option is B)61 days. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, the options are A)51, B)61, C)71, D)81, E)91. So 61 is an option, so that's the choice. But wait, let me double-check my calculation. 14 squared is 196, multiplied by pi. Pi is about 3.1416, so 3.1416 * 196.\n\nLet me compute that more accurately. 196 * 3 = 588. 196 * 0.1416 is approximately 27.8736. Adding 588 +27.8736 gives 615.8736. Correct. So 615.8736 /10 =61.587 days. So about 61.59 days. So the approximate time is 62 days, but since the options are in tens, 61 is the closest. So answer B.\n",

It grazes 10 square feet per day. I need to find out how long it'll take to graze the whole field. The options are from 51 to 91 days, so I'm looking for something in that range.\n\nWait, wait. Hmm. So, the cow is tied in the middle, right? So the area it can graze is a circle with radius 14 feet. The area of a circle is \u03c0r\u00b2. Let me calculate that. R is 14, so 14 squared is 196.

So the area is about 615.44 sq.ft.\n\nWait, but the cow can only graze 10 sq.ft per day. So the total time needed would be the total area divided by the daily grazing rate.
