      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the total bus fare for a group of people. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nAlright, the problem says that the bus fare for one adult from Ranchi to Patna is Rs. 140. And the fare for a child is half of that adult fare. I need to find out the total fare for 4 adults and 3 children. \n\nWait, so first, I should figure out what the child's fare is. The adult fare is 140, so half of that would be 140 divided by 2. Let me calculate that. 140 divided by 2 is 70. Oh, so each child's ticket is Rs. 70. \n\nNow, I have 4 adults and 3 children. I need to calculate the total fare by adding the cost for all adults and all children together. \n\nLet's compute the adult fare first. 4 adults times Rs. 140 each. So 4 multiplied by 140. Hmm, 4 times 100 is 400, and 4 times 40 is 160, so 400+160 is 560. So the total for adults is 560 rupees. \n\nNext, the children's fare. 3 children times Rs. 70 each. 3 times 70 is 210. So the children's total is 210. \n\nNow, I add the two totals together. 560 plus 210. Let me add that. 560 + 200 is 760, and then plus 10 is 770. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 560 plus 210 is actually 770? Because 560 + 200 is 760, and then add 10 more, yes, 770. So the total fare is Rs. 770. \n\nLooking at the options, option E is 770. So the correct answer should be E. \n\nBut wait, did I do everything right? Let me double-check. \n\nAdult fare: 140 per adult. 4 adults: 4 * 140 = 560. Correct. Child fare: 70 per child. 3 children: 3 *70=210. Correct. 560 +210=770. Yes, that's right. So E is the right choice.\n",
