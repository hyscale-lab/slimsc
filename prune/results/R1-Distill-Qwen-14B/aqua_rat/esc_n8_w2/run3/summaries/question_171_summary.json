      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about magazine subscriptions and savings. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the question says that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, and this represents a 25% saving compared to buying each issue at the cover price. I need to find out what the cover price per issue is.\n\nWait, so the subscription is cheaper because it's a bulk purchase, right? So the $42 is 25% less than the total cover price for 15 issues. Oh, wait, wait. Let me think about this. If 25% is saved, that means the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. Because 100% minus 25% saving equals 75% of the original.\n\nSo, mathematically, if I let the total cover price be T, then 42 is 75% of T. Because you're paying 75% and saving 25%. So the equation would be 42 = 0.75 * T. Then I can solve for T.\n\nRight, so to find T, I divide both sides by 0.75. Let's do that: T = 42 / 0.75. Let me calculate that. 42 divided by 0.75. Hmm, 0.75 is the same as 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So 42 * (4/3) equals (42/3)*4, which is 14 *4 =56. So the total cover price for 15 issues is $56.\n\nNow, to find the cover price per issue, I divide this total by 15. So 56 divided by 15. Let me compute that. 15 times 3 is 45, 15 times 3.7 is 55.5 (because 15*3=45, 15*0.7=10.5; 45+10.5=55.5). Hmm, so 56 is 0.5 more than 55.5, so 3.7 plus (0.5/15) which is 0.0333... So approximately 3.7333...\n\nWait, but looking at the options, let's see. The options are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73. Oh, so 3.7333 is approximately 3.73. So that would be option E.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in my calculation? Let me double-check. Because 15 issues at cover price total $56. So 56 divided by 15. Let me do the division more accurately. 15 into 56. 15*3=45, subtract, 11 left. Bring down a zero: 110. 15*7=105. Subtract, 5 left. Bring down another zero: 50. 15*3=45. Subtract, 5 again. So it's 3.733... So yeah, about 3.73. So per issue, the cover price is approximately $3.73.\n\nSo the correct answer should be E) $3.73.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the cover price per issue, we start by noting that the subscription cost of $42.00 represents a 25% saving compared to the total cover price for 15 issues.

The question says that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, and this represents a 25% saving compared to buying each issue individually at the cover price. I need to find out what the cover price per issue is.\n\nHmm, alright. So, the subscription is cheaper than buying each issue separately. The saving is 25%, which I think means that the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price for 15 issues. Or wait, maybe I should think about it the other way around. If the subscription is a saving of 25%, then the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. Because 100% minus 25% is 75%, right?\n\nLet me break it down. Let's say the total cover price for 15 issues is some amount, and the subscription is 25% off that. So, $42 is what you pay, which is 75% of the total cover price. So, if I let T be the total cover price, then 75% of T is $42. So, T * 0.75 = 42. To find T, I can divide 42 by 0.75. \n\nWait, let me write that down. T = 42 / 0.75. Let me calculate that. 42 divided by 0.75. Hmm, 42 divided by 3/4 is the same as 42 multiplied by 4/3. So, 42 * 4 is 168, divided by 3 is 56. So, T is $56. That means the total cover price for 15 issues is $56. \n\nNow, to find the cover price per issue, I need to divide this total by the number of issues, which is 15. So, 56 divided by 15. Let me do that division. 15 goes into 56 three times (since 15*3=45), with a remainder of 11. So, 56/15 is 3 with 11/15 left. Converting that to a decimal, 11 divided by 15 is approximately 0.7333... So, 3.7333 per issue. \n\nWait, but the options given are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73. So, I'm getting approximately $3.73 per issue. That would be option E. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.\n\nSo, total cover price is $56 for 15 issues. 56 /15 is indeed approximately 3.73. So each issue is about $3.73. So the answer should be E.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it: the subscription is $42 for 15 issues, which is a 25% discount. So, the amount saved is 25% of the cover price. Let me see if that approach gives the same result. The saving is 25%, which is $42 compared to the cover price. So, saving = 0.25 * T, where T is the total cover price. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because if the subscription is 25% off, then the subscription price is T - 0.25*T = 0.75*T. So, that's the same as before. So, I think my initial approach was correct.\n\nAnother way: if the subscription is $42, which is 75% of the total, then the total is 42 / 0.75 = 56. So, 56 divided by 15 is about 3.73 per issue. So, E is the correct answer.\n",
