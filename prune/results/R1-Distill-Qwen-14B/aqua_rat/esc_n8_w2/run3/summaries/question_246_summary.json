      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: There's a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. If five registered voters are chosen at random, what's the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted?\n\nHmm, alright. So each voter has a 90% chance of voting. We're picking five at random, and we want exactly four who voted. Sounds like a binomial probability problem.\n\nRight, binomial distribution. The formula for that is P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n is the number of trials, k is the number of successes, p is the probability of success.\n\nIn this case, n is 5, k is 4, and p is 0.9. So I need to calculate that.\n\nLet me break it down. First, the combination part: C(5,4). That's 5 choose 4. How many ways can four successes happen in five trials? That's 5, because each time one of the five voters doesn't vote, and the others do. So C(5,4) is 5.\n\nThen p^k is 0.9^4. Let me calculate that. 0.9^4 is 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9. Let me compute it step by step.\n\n0.9 * 0.9 is 0.81. Then 0.81 * 0.9 is 0.729, and 0.729 * 0.9 is 0.6561. So 0.9^4 is 0.6561.\n\nNext, (1-p)^(n-k) is (0.1)^(5-4) = 0.1^1, which is 0.1.\n\nMultiply all these together: 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1.\n\nLet me compute that. 0.6561 * 0.1 is 0.06561. Then 5 * 0.06561 is 0.32805.\n\nSo the probability is approximately 0.32805, which is 32.805%. Looking at the options, option B is 32.8%, which matches this value.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake. Let me double-check each step.\n\nC(5,4) is definitely 5. 0.9^4, I think I did that right. 0.9 squared is 0.81, then times 0.9 is 0.729, times another 0.9 is 0.6561. Correct. Then 0.1 to the first power is 0.1.\n\nSo 5 * 0.6561 = 3.2805? Wait no, wait. Wait, 5 multiplied by 0.6561 is 3.2805? Wait, no, wait. Because 0.6561 * 0.1 is 0.06561. Then 5 times that is 0.32805.\n\nWait, 5 * 0.06561: 0.06 *5 is 0.3, and 0.00561 *5 is 0.02805. So 0.3 +0.02805=0.32805. Yeah, that's 32.805%, so approximately 32.8%. So option B is correct.\n\nI don't think I missed anything. It's a straightforward binomial calculation. So the answer should be B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we recognize it as a binomial probability question. The formula for the binomial probability is:\n\n\\[\nP(k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\cdot p^k \\cdot (1-p)^{n-k}\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\( n = 5 \\) (number of trials),\n- \\( k = 4 \\) (number of successes),\n- \\( p = 0.9 \\) (probability of success).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the combination\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{4} = 5\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate \\( p^k \\)\n\\[\n0.9^4 = 0.9 \\cdot 0.9 \\cdot 0.9 \\cdot 0.9 = 0.6561\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate \\( (1-p)^{n-k} \\)\n\\[\n0.1^{5-4} = 0.1^1 = 0.1\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Combine the results\n\\[\nP(4) = 5 \\cdot 0.6561 \\cdot 0.1 = 5 \\cdot 0.06561 = 0.32805\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Convert to percentage\n\\[\n0.32805 \\approx 32.8\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the approximate likelihood that exactly four of the five voters voted in the last election is **32.8%**, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

Hmm, this sounds like a binomial probability situation.\n\nWait, binomial distribution is when there are a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes, like success or failure. In this case, each voter is a trial, and success is that they voted (90% chance), failure is they didn't (10%).
