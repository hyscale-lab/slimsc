      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the percentage gain of a merchant who bought oranges and sold them. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my business math, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nAlright, the problem says the merchant bought 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450. Wait, that means the total cost is Rs. 450 for all 90 kg. So, to find the cost per kg, I can divide the total cost by the quantity. Let me write that down.\n\nCost per kg = Total Cost / Quantity = 450 / 90. Let me do that division. 450 divided by 90 is 5. So each kg cost him Rs. 5. Got it.\n\nNow, he sold the whole lot at Rs. 7.50 per kg. So the selling price per kg is higher than the cost price, which means he made a profit. I need to calculate the percentage gain.\n\nWait, percentage gain usually refers to the profit percentage, right? So the formula for profit percentage is (Profit / Cost Price) * 100. But to get the profit, I think I need to find out how much he sold it for in total and subtract the cost.\n\nLet me calculate the total selling price first. He sold 90 kg at 7.50 per kg. So total revenue is 90 * 7.50. Let me compute that. 90 multiplied by 7 is 630, and 90 multiplied by 0.50 is 45. So 630 +45 = 675. So he made Rs. 675 in total.\n\nHis cost was Rs. 450, so the profit is 675 - 450. Let's subtract that: 675 minus 450 is 225. So he made a profit of Rs. 225.\n\nNow, to find the profit percentage, I take the profit divided by the cost price, multiplied by 100. So that's (225 / 450) * 100. Hmm, 225 divided by 450 is 0.5. 0.5 times 100 is 50%. So the percentage gain is 50%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 50%. So I think the correct answer is A.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nCost price per kg: 450 /90 =5. Correct. Selling price per kg:7.5. So per kg profit is 2.5. Then total profit is 2.5 *90 =225. Correct. Profit percentage: (225/450)*100=50%. Yep, that's right.\n",

The profit is calculated as Rs. 675 (total selling price) minus Rs. 450 (total cost price), which equals Rs. 225.
