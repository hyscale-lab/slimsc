      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a fan blade. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says a point on the edge of a fan blade is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center. I need to find the distance traveled by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute. The options are given as A to E, with various multiples of pi.\n\nWait, so the point is moving in a circular path, right? So the distance it travels would be the circumference of the circle multiplied by the number of times it goes around, which is the number of revolutions. Oh right, because each revolution covers the circumference once.\n\nLet me write down what I know. The radius of the circle is 10 cm. The formula for the circumference is 2 * pi * radius. So that's 2 * pi * 10 cm, which is 20 pi cm per revolution.\n\nThe fan is running at 300 revolutions per minute. But the time given is 30 seconds. Oh, I need to convert the time into minutes to match the units. Since 30 seconds is half a minute, that's 0.5 minutes.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. 300 revolutions per minute is the speed. So in one minute, it does 300 revs. So in 30 seconds, which is half a minute, it would do 150 revolutions. Oh right, because 300 rev/min * 0.5 min = 150 revs.\n\nSo the total distance is number of revolutions multiplied by the circumference. So 150 revs * 20 pi cm/rev. Let me calculate that.\n\n150 * 20 is 3000. So 3000 pi cm. Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 3000 pi. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I messed up the time conversion. Oh no, 30 seconds is 0.5 minutes, right. So 300 * 0.5 is 150 revs. Yep. And 150 times 20 pi is 3000 pi. So yes, D is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: find the angular speed in radians per second, then multiply by time to get total angle, then multiply by radius to get arc length. Let's see if that gives the same result.\n\nAngular speed (omega) is 300 rev/min. Each rev is 2 pi radians, so omega is 300 * 2 pi rad/min. Which is 600 pi rad/min. To get per second, divide by 60: 600 pi /60 =10 pi rad/s.\n\nTime is 30 seconds. So total angle is 10 pi *30 = 300 pi radians.\n\nArc length is r * theta. Radius is 10 cm, so 10 * 300 pi = 3000 pi cm. Yep, same answer. So definitely D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the distance traveled by a point on the edge of a fan blade, we start by noting that the point moves in a circular path with a radius of 10 cm.
