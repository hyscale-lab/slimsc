      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a rectangular parking space. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. The problem says that three of its sides are painted, which probably means that the fourth side is unpainted. Wait, but rectangles have four sides, two lengths and two widths. So if three are painted, one is not. \n\nThe length of the unpainted side is 9 feet. So I'm thinking, if the unpainted side is one of the lengths or one of the widths. But wait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So if the unpainted side is a length, then the other length must be painted. Or if it's a width, the other width is painted. Wait, but the problem says three sides are painted. So perhaps two sides of one dimension and one of the other are painted. Let me think.\n\nLet me define the sides. Let's say the rectangle has length L and width W. Now, the sides that are painted would be three of the four. So, either two lengths and one width are painted, or two widths and one length are painted. Because if you paint three sides, it's probably two of one pair and one of the other.\n\nThe unpainted side is 9 feet. So if the unpainted side is a length, then L = 9. Then the other length is painted. Or if the unpainted side is a width, then W =9, and the other width is painted.\n\nThe sum of the painted sides is 37 feet. So the sum of the three painted sides is 37. Let me consider both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: Unpainted side is a length (L=9). Then the painted sides would be the other length (L=9), and both widths (W each). So sum of painted sides is L + 2W = 9 + 2W. And this is equal to 37. So 9 + 2W =37 \u2192 2W=28 \u2192 W=14. Then the area would be L * W = 9 *14=126. \n\nCase 2: Unpainted side is a width (W=9). Then the painted sides are both lengths (L each) and one width (W=9). So sum is 2L +9 =37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Then the area is L * W =14 *9=126. \n\nWait, both cases give the same area. So the area would be 126 square feet. Let me check the options. Option C is 126. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recalculate.\n\nIn case 1: L is 9, painted sides are L (9) and two Ws. So 9 + 2W =37 \u2192 2W=28 \u2192 W=14. Area is 9*14=126. Correct.\n\nCase 2: W is 9, painted sides are two Ls and W (9). So 2L +9=37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Area is 14*9=126. Also correct.\n\nSo in either scenario, the area is 126. So the correct answer is C.\n",

Wait, so that leaves one side unpainted. The length of the unpainted side is 9 feet. Oh, and the sum of the painted sides is 37 feet. I need to find the area of the parking space.\n\nAlright, let me visualize this. A rectangle has four sides: two lengths and two widths. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, if three sides are painted, the fourth is not. Let's think about which sides could be painted. Maybe two lengths and one width, or two widths and one length.\n\nWait, the problem says three sides are painted. So the fourth is the unpainted one. Let's say the sides are painted in such a way that either two lengths and one width are painted, or two widths and one length. But since the unpainted side is 9 feet, that could be either a length or a width.\n\nWait, let me define variables to make this easier. Let me call the length 'L' and the width 'W'. Now, in a rectangle, two sides are length and two are width. So, if the unpainted side is 9 feet, that's either a length or a width.\n\nCase 1: The unpainted side is the length (L) = 9 feet. Then, the painted sides would be two widths and one length. Wait, no, because if the unpainted side is L, then the painted sides would be the other three. Wait, no, the three painted sides would include two widths and one length. Because in a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal. So if one length is unpainted, the other length is painted. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, if three sides are painted, then the fourth is unpainted. So, let's think: the total perimeter is 2L + 2W. If one side is unpainted, say one length, then the painted sides would be the other length and both widths. So the sum of painted sides would be L + 2W. Alternatively, if the unpainted side is a width, then the painted sides are 2L + W.\n\nSo, the sum of the painted sides is either L + 2W or 2L + W. And the unpainted side is either L or W, equal to 9.\n\nSo, let's set up equations.\n\nCase 1: Unpainted side is L = 9.\n\nThen, sum of painted sides is 2L + W? Wait no, no. Wait, if L is unpainted, then the painted sides are the other L, both W's. So painted sides are L + 2W. And this sum is given as 37.\n\nSo, in this case, we have L = 9, and L + 2W = 37.\n\nSo substituting, 9 + 2W = 37. Subtract 9 from both sides: 2W=28. So W=14.\n\nThen, area would be L * W = 9 *14=126.\n\nCase 2: Unpainted side is W=9.\n\nThen, the painted sides are 2L + W.\n\nSum is 2L + 9 =37.\n\nSo 2L=28, L=14.\n\nArea is L * W =14 *9=126 again.\n\nWait, so regardless of whether the unpainted side is length or width, the area is the same.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So both cases give the same area. So the area is 126. Looking at the options, option C is 126.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because I might have messed up the painted sides in each case.\n\nIn case 1: unpainted is length (9). Painted sides are other length (9), two widths (each W). So sum is 9 + 2W =37. 2W=28, W=14. Area=9*14=126.\n\nCase 2: unpainted is width (9). Painted sides are two lengths (each L) and the other width (9). So sum is 2L +9=37. 2L=28, L=14. Area=14*9=126.\n\nSo yes, same area.
