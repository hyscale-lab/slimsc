      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question says, \"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third. What is the value of 50% of that number?\" Hmm, I need to find 50% of the original number after subtracting 30 makes it one third of the original. \n\nAlright, let's break this down. Let me denote the original number as 'x'. So, according to the problem, when we subtract 30 from x, the result is one third of x. So the equation would be x - 30 equals (1/3)x. \n\nWait, wait. So the equation is x - 30 = (1/3)x. That makes sense because subtracting 30 reduces it to a third. Now I need to solve for x. \n\nLet me rearrange this equation. Subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get x - (1/3)x - 30 = 0. Wait, maybe a better way is to move all x terms to one side. So x - (1/3)x = 30. \n\nLet me compute x minus (1/3)x. That would be (3/3)x minus (1/3)x, which is (2/3)x. So (2/3)x equals 30. \n\nTo find x, I can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (2/3), which is (3/2). So x = 30 * (3/2). Let me calculate that. 30 divided by 2 is 15, multiplied by 3 is 45. So x is 45. \n\nWait, so the original number is 45. Now the question asks for 50% of that number. 50% is the same as half, so 45 divided by 2. Let's do that: 45/2 is 22.5. \n\nHmm, looking at the options, A is 22.5. So the answer should be A. But wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nOriginal equation: x - 30 = (1/3)x. Subtract (1/3)x from both sides: (2/3)x = 30. Multiply both sides by (3/2): x = 45. 50% of 45 is indeed 22.5. So option A makes sense. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. The problem says when 30 is subtracted, the number is reduced to its one third. So the new number is one third of the original. So 45 minus 30 is 15, which is one third of 45. Yep, that's correct. So 15 is indeed 45's third. \n\nSo yes, 50% of 45 is 22.5. So the answer is A. Looking at the options, option A is 22.5. So I think I got it right.\n",

What is the value of 50% of that number?\" Hmm, I need to find 50% of the original number after this subtraction.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. So there's a number, let's call it x. When we subtract 30 from it, the result is one third of the original number. So, mathematically, that would be x minus 30 equals (1/3)x. I can write that as an equation: x - 30 = (1/3)x.\n\nNow I need to solve for x. Let me rearrange the equation. Subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get the x terms on one side. So, x - (1/3)x -30 =0. Hmm, wait, actually, let's subtract (1/3)x from both sides:\n\nx - 30 = (1/3)x  \nx - (1/3)x = 30\n\nCombining the x terms. x is the same as (3/3)x, so (3/3)x - (1/3)x is (2/3)x. So, (2/3)x =30.\n\nNow, to find x, I can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 2/3, which is 3/2. So:\n\nx = 30 * (3/2)\n\nLet me calculate that. 30 times 3 is 90, divided by 2 is 45. So x is 45. \n\nWait, wait, let me double-check that. If I subtract 30 from 45, I get 15. Is 15 equal to a third of 45? Because a third of 45 is 15. Yes, that's correct. So the original number is 45.\n\nNow the question asks for 50% of that number. 50% is the same as half. So 45 divided by 2 is 22.5. Wait, but looking at the options, I see option A is 22.5.

So yes, x is definitely 45.\n\nSo 50% of 45 is 22.5. That's option A. So the correct answer should be A.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think again. The question says \"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third.\" So when you subtract 30, the result is a third of the original. So if the original is 45, subtracting 30 gives 15, which is indeed 45/3=15. So that's correct.\n\nSo the 50% is 22.5, which is option A.\n",
