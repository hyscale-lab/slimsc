      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question here: What is the value of log base 2 of 4? Hmm, I remember that logarithms are the inverses of exponentials. So log base 2 of 4 is like asking, \"2 raised to what power gives me 4?\" \n\nLet me think. 2 to the first power is 2. 2 squared is 4. Oh wait, so 2^2 equals 4. That means the exponent I'm looking for is 2. So log\u20824 should be 2. \n\nWait, are there any other possibilities? No, because logarithms are unique. Each number has one logarithm for a given base. So yeah, the answer should be 2. \n\nLooking at the options: A is 2, B is 4, C is 6, D is 8, E is 12. So the correct answer is option A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question here about logarithms, and I'm a bit rusty on my math, but let's try to think it through. The question is asking for the value of log base 2 of 4. Hmm, right, logarithms are the inverses of exponentials, right? So log base 2 of 4 is like asking, \"2 raised to what power gives me 4?\" \n\nWait, wait, I remember that 2 squared is 4. So 2^2 =4. That means the exponent here is 2. So the logarithm, which is the exponent, should be 2. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 2. So that should be the correct answer. But wait, just to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me double-check. \n\nLogarithms: log_b a = c means that b^c = a. So here, b is 2, a is 4. So 2^c =4. I know 2^1 is 2, 2^2 is 4. So yes, c is 2. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in another way. If I remember the logarithm rules, log2(4) is the same as log2(2^2). And using the power rule, that's 2 * log2(2). Since log2(2) is 1, that's 2*1=2. Yep, that confirms it again. \n\nSo I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is A)2.\n",
