      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a shopkeeper selling a watch with different discounts and how that affects his profit. Hmm, I need to find the marked price. Let me try to break it down.\n\nSo the first scenario: the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount and makes a certain profit. The second scenario is when he gives a 7% discount, and his profit is Rs. 15 less than the first case. I think I need to find the marked price based on these two scenarios.\n\nWait, wait. I'm a bit confused about how the discounts relate to the profit. Oh right, profit depends on the selling price. So when the discount increases, the selling price decreases, which would mean the profit is less. But how exactly?\n\nLet me define some variables. Let the marked price be M. The cost price, I'm not sure if it's given. Oh wait, the problem doesn't give the cost price. Hmm, maybe I can express everything in terms of M and the cost price.\n\nWait, no, the problem says when he gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit, and when he gives a 7% discount, the profit is Rs.15 less. So the difference in profit between the two scenarios is 15 Rs.\n\nLet me think. The selling price when discount is 5% is M*(100-5)% = 0.95*M. Similarly, when the discount is 7%, the selling price is 0.93*M.\n\nThe profit in each case would be selling price minus cost price. Let's denote the cost price as C. So, profit1 = 0.95M - C, and profit2 = 0.93M - C.\n\nThe difference between the two profits is 15 Rs, and since profit2 is less than profit1, profit1 - profit2 = 15.\n\nSo, (0.95M - C) - (0.93M - C) = 15. Let me compute that.\n\n0.95M - C -0.93M + C =15. Oh wait, the C terms cancel out. So (0.95 -0.93) M =15.\n\n0.02 M =15. So M =15 / 0.02 = 750.\n\nWait, that's straightforward. So the marked price is 750 Rs. Let me check the options.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 750. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes profit could be on cost price or selling price, but I think here it's just straightforward profit as selling price minus cost.\n\nSo if M is 750, then at 5% discount, selling price is 750*0.95 = 712.5. Cost price is, let's say, C. Profit1 is 712.5 - C.\n\nAt 7% discount, selling price is 750*0.93=697.5. Profit2 is 697.5 - C.\n\nThe difference is (712.5 - C) - (697.5 - C) = 712.5 -697.5 = 15. Which matches. So yes, correct.\n\nSo the answer is D.\n",

Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem says that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But if he gives a 7% discount instead, his profit is Rs. 15 less. I need to find the marked price of the watch from the given options.\n\nHmm, let's think about how discounts and profit work. The marked price is the original price before any discount. When the shopkeeper gives a discount, the selling price decreases, which would affect his profit.\n\nWait, but profit is calculated based on the cost price, right? So the cost price is fixed, and the selling price is the marked price minus the discount. The difference between the selling price and the cost price is the profit.\n\nSo, let's denote the marked price as M. The cost price is probably a fixed value that doesn't change with the discount. Let's call the cost price C.\n\nWhen the discount is 5%, the selling price S1 is M minus 5% of M, which is 0.95M. The profit in this case is S1 minus C, so 0.95M - C.\n\nWhen the discount is increased to 7%, the selling price S2 is M minus 7% of M, which is 0.93M. The profit here is S2 minus C, so 0.93M - C.\n\nThe problem states that the profit is Rs. 15 less in the second case. So, the profit when discount is 7% is 15 less than when the discount is 5%. That means:\n\n(0.95M - C) - (0.93M - C) = 15\n\nWait, let me compute that. Let's subtract the two profits. \n\nSo, (0.95M - C) - (0.93M - C) = 0.95M - C - 0.93M + C. The Cs cancel out, so 0.02M = 15.\n\nOh, right! So 0.02M equals 15. Then M is 15 divided by 0.02. Let me calculate that: 15 / 0.02 is the same as 15 * 50, which is 750. So the marked price M is 750.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 750. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my steps. So, the difference between the two selling prices is 0.02M, which is 15. So M=750. That makes sense because 5% discount is 37.5, 7% is 52.5. The difference is 15, which would directly affect the profit. So yes, the marked price is 750.\n",
