      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: If 6 years are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained. Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years. We need to find Ajay's present age.\n\nHmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the ages involved. I'll start by jotting down what I know.\n\nDenis's age is given as 5 years. Since Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, Rahul's age must be Denis's age minus 2. So Rahul is 5 - 2 = 3 years old. Wait, that seems really young, but okay, maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check that. If Denis is 5 years old, and Rahul is two years younger, yes, Rahul would be 3. So Rahul is 3 years old.\n\nNow, the problem says that when you subtract 6 years from Ajay's present age and then divide the remainder by 18, you get Rahul's age. So mathematically, that can be written as:\n\n(Rahul's age) = (Ajay's age - 6) / 18\n\nWe know Rahul's age is 3, so substituting that in:\n\n3 = (Ajay's age - 6) / 18\n\nLet me solve for Ajay's age. Multiply both sides by 18 to get rid of the denominator:\n\n3 * 18 = Ajay's age - 6\n54 = Ajay's age - 6\n\nNow add 6 to both sides:\n\n54 + 6 = Ajay's age\n60 = Ajay's age\n\nSo Ajay is 60 years old. Looking at the options, option B is 60. So I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, did I make any mistakes here? Let me go through it again.\n\nDenis is 5. Rahul is 5 - 2 = 3. So that part is correct.\n\nAjay's age minus 6, divided by 18 equals Rahul's age (3). So equation is (Aj -6)/18 = 3.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 18 gives Aj -6 = 54. Adding 6 gives Aj = 60. Yeah, that looks right.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 60, which is option B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem states that Rahul's age is obtained by subtracting 6 years from Ajay's age and dividing the remainder by 18. Additionally, Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years. \n\nFirst, determine Rahul's age. Since Denis is 5 years old and Rahul is 2 years younger, Rahul's age is:\n\\[\n\\text{Rahul's age} = 5 - 2 = 3 \\text{ years}.\n\\]\n\nNext, use the relationship between Ajay's age and Rahul's age.

I'll need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that if 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age, the remainder is divided by 18, and that gives Rahul's present age. So let's translate that into an equation. Let me denote Ajay's age as A. So, (A - 6) divided by 18 equals Rahul's age. So mathematically, that's (A - 6)/18 = Rahul's age. I'll write that as R = (A -6)/18. Got that.\n\nNext part of the problem says Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years. Wait, wait. Let me read that again. Oh, wait, the way it's phrased: \"Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs.\" So, Denis is 5 years old, right? Because it says \"Denis whose age is 5 yrs.\" So, Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis. So if Denis is 5, Rahul is 5 - 2 = 3 years old.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Wait, wait, no, maybe I got the structure wrong. Let me parse the sentence again. \"Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs.\" So, the structure is Rahul's age = Denis's age - 2. Because Rahul is younger than Denis by 2 years. So, if Denis is 5, Rahul is 5-2=3. So Rahul is 3 years old.\n\nSo Rahul's age R is 3. So from the earlier equation, R = (A -6)/18. So 3 = (A -6)/18. I can solve for A.\n\nMultiply both sides by 18: 3 *18 = A -6 \u2192 54 = A -6. Then add 6 to both sides: A = 60.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, B is 60. So that's one of the choices. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nSo, if Ajay is 60, subtracting 6 gives 54. Divided by 18 is 3, which is Rahul's age. Rahul is 3, which is 2 years younger than Denis who is 5. Yep, that adds up. So the answer should be 60, which is option B.\n",
