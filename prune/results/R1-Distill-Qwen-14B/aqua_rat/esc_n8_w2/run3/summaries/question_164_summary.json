      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about making identical bouquets with white and red tulips. The question is asking for the greatest number of bouquets I can make without leaving any flowers. Hmm, let me think.\n\nSo, the total white tulips are 28 and red ones are 98. Each bouquet has some white and some red. And since they have to be identical, every bouquet must have the same number of white and red tulips. Also, no flowers can be left, meaning all the white and red must be used up exactly.\n\nWait, so I guess I need to find how many bouquets (let's say 'n') can be made such that 28 white and 98 red are completely divided into 'n' bouquets. Each bouquet would then have 28/n white and 98/n red tulips. But wait, since you can't have a fraction of a tulip, both 28/n and 98/n need to be whole numbers. Oh right, so 'n' must be a divisor of both 28 and 98. So, I'm looking for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98.\n\nWait, what's the GCD of 28 and 98? Let me calculate. Let's factor both.\n\n28 factors: 2*2*7, so 2\u00b2 *7\u00b9.\n98 factors: 2*49=2*7\u00b2, so 2\u00b9 *7\u00b2.\n\nThe GCD is the product of the smallest exponents of the common primes. So for 2, it's 2^1, and for 7, it's 7^1. So GCD is 2*7=14. So the maximum number of bouquets is 14.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, D is 14. So is that the answer? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, if I make 14 bouquets, each would have 28/14=2 white and 98/14=7 red. So each bouquet has 2 white and 7 red. That works because 2*14=28 and 7*14=98. So yeah, that uses all the flowers, and no leftovers.\n\nAlternatively, are there any larger numbers possible? Well, the options go up to 21, which is higher than 14. Let's see if 21 is a divisor of both.\n\n21: 28 divided by 21 is about 1.333, which isn't a whole number. So 21 can't be the number of bouquets because you can't have 1.333 white tulips. So 21 is out.\n\nWhat about 14? As above, it works. So the answer should be D)14.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made using 28 white and 98 red tulips without leaving any flowers unused, we need to find the largest number of bouquets ('n') such that both the white and red tulips can be evenly divided into 'n' bouquets. This means 'n' must be a common divisor of 28 and 98.\n\nFirst, we calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98:\n\n- **Prime factorization of 28**: \\( 2^2 \\times 7^1 \\)\n- **Prime factorization of 98**: \\( 2^1 \\times 7^2 \\)\n\nThe GCD is the product of the smallest powers of the common prime factors:\n\\[\n\\text{GCD} = 2^1 \\times 7^1 = 2 \\times 7 = 14\n\\]\n\nThus, the greatest number of identical bouquets is 14.

So, I need to figure out how to divide 28 white and 98 red tulips into bouquets such that each bouquet has the same number of white and red tulips, and I want as many bouquets as possible.\n\nWait, right, identical bouquets mean that each has the same count of white and red. So, each bouquet has, say, w white and r red tulips. Then, the total number of bouquets n must satisfy n*w = 28 and n*r = 98. Because we can't have any flowers left, both 28 and 98 must be perfectly divisible by n. So, n has to be a common divisor of 28 and 98.\n\nOh, right! So the problem is really about finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98. Because the largest possible n that divides both numbers without remainder will give the maximum number of bouquets.\n\nLet me calculate the GCD of 28 and 98. To find the GCD, I can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nFirst, 98 divided by 28: 28 times 3 is 84. 98 minus 84 is 14. So, the remainder is 14. Now, I take 28 and divide by 14. 14 times 2 is 28, so the remainder is zero. So the GCD is 14.\n\nWait, so the greatest number of bouquets is 14? But wait, let me double-check. Because 28 divided by 14 is 2, so each bouquet would have 2 white tulips. And 98 divided by 14 is 7, so each bouquet has 7 red tulips.

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the GCD.\n\nAnother way: factors of 28 are 1,2,4,7,14,28. Factors of 98 are 1,2,7,14,49,98. The common factors are 1,2,7,14. The greatest is 14, so yes, 14 is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be D)14.\n",
