      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a wire that's shaped into a rectangle, and then it's rebent into a square. I need to find the length of each side of the square. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you bend a wire into a shape, the total length of the wire remains the same. So the perimeter of the original rectangle should be equal to the perimeter of the new square. Oh right, because the wire isn't stretching or shrinking, just changing shape.\n\nThe rectangle has a length of 27 cm and a breadth of 17 cm. Wait, so to find the perimeter of a rectangle, the formula is 2*(length + breadth). Let me calculate that. So that's 2*(27 + 17). Let me add those numbers: 27 plus 17 is 44. Multiply by 2, that gives 88 cm. So the perimeter is 88 cm.\n\nNow, when the wire is rebent into a square, the perimeter remains 88 cm. The formula for the perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length. Let me denote the side as 's'. So 4*s = 88. To find 's', I'll divide both sides by 4. 88 divided by 4 is... 22. So each side of the square is 22 cm.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 27 plus 17 is 44. Multiply by 2 is 88. Then 88 divided by 4 is indeed 22. Yep, that seems right.\n\nLooking back at the options provided: A)9, B)11, C)22, D)25, E)31. So the correct answer must be option C)22.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the total length of the wire remains constant when it is bent into a different shape.
