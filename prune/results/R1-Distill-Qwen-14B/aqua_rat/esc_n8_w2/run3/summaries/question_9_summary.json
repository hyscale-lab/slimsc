      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is about 200 students in a school. It says that at least 45% attended the prom night, and at least 35% took part in the debating session. I need to find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debate. The options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.\n\nHmm, right. So, let's break this down. I remember that when dealing with such problems, especially ones about maximum or minimum overlaps, it's often useful to think in terms of sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nWait, but the question is about the maximum number of students who didn't attend either event. So, to maximize the number of students who neither went to prom nor debated, we want to minimize the number of students who attended at least one of these two events.\n\nBut wait, how do we do that? Because the problem says at least 45% attended prom and at least 35% debated. So those are the minimum numbers required for each event. But to find the minimum number of students who attended at least one event, I think I need to arrange it so that the overlap between the two events is as large as possible. Because if more students went to both, then fewer students are needed to meet the minimums, leaving more room for others not attending either.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The maximum number of students who neither attended prom nor debate would occur when the number of students who attended at least one event is as small as possible. So how small can that number be?\n\nThe minimum number of students who went to prom is 45% of 200. Let me calculate that. 45% of 200 is 0.45 * 200 = 90 students. Similarly, at least 35% debated, which is 0.35 * 200 = 70 students.\n\nSo, the minimum number of students who went to prom is 90, and the minimum for debate is 70. Now, the total number of students who attended either prom or debate or both can't be less than the sum of these two numbers minus the overlap. Wait, because if some students went to both, then they're counted twice when adding 90 and 70. So, the minimum number of students who attended at least one event is 90 + 70 - x, where x is the maximum possible overlap. Because the maximum possible overlap would minimize the total unique attendees.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The maximum overlap would be when as many students as possible are in both groups, right? So the maximum possible overlap can't exceed the smaller of the two groups. So the maximum number of students who could have gone to both is the smaller of 90 and 70, which is 70.\n\nSo if all 70 debate attendees also went to prom, then the total number of unique students who attended at least one event would be 90 + (70 - 70) = 90. Because the 70 in both are already counted in the 90.\n\nWait, that's an interesting point. So in that case, the total unique attendees would be 90. Because the 70 who debated are all within the 90 who went to prom.\n\nSo then, the number of students who didn't attend either would be 200 minus 90, which is 110. But wait, wait a second. The options don't have 110 as the maximum. Wait, looking back, the options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110. Oh, E is 110.\n\nBut that can't be right because if all 70 debate attendees were in the 90 prom attendees, then the total is 90. But 90 is the minimum number for prom, so that's acceptable. So then, 200 -90 = 110 students didn't attend either.\n\nWait, but that seems to be the maximum possible. Because if the overlap is as large as possible, the total number attending at least one event is as small as possible, which would leave more students outside.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes these problems have constraints that I might be missing. Like, for instance, the minimums are 90 and 70. So the total attending at least one event can't be less than 90 +70 -200 = 60. Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nThe formula is |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. The minimum value of |A \u222a B| would occur when |A \u2229 B| is as large as possible. Because as |A \u2229 B| increases, the total |A \u222a B| decreases.\n\nSo the maximum possible |A \u2229 B| is the smaller of |A| and |B|. So here, |A|=90, |B|=70. So the maximum possible |A \u2229 B| is 70.\n\nSo plugging into the formula: |A \u222a B| = 90 +70 -70 =90. So the minimum number of students who attended at least one event is 90.\n\nThus, the maximum number who didn't attend either is 200 -90 = 110.\n\nWait, but that's option E. But I thought maybe it's not correct because if all the debate attendees were already in the prom attendees, then 90 is the total, which would allow 110 not to attend. So why is the maximum 110?\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes, the problem might involve other constraints. Let me see.\n\nWait, the question says 'at least 45% attended prom' and 'at least 35% debated'. So the numbers 90 and 70 are the minimums. So when trying to find the maximum number of students who did neither, I need to arrange the attendees such that the total number attending at least one event is as small as possible.\n\nWhich is achieved when the overlap between the two groups is as large as possible. So, maximum overlap is 70, so the union is 90.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number who did neither is 200 -90=110, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the maximum number who didn't attend either would be less than that. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because the minimum number attending at least one event is 90, as in 90 +70 -70 =90. So 200-90=110. So the maximum number who neither attended prom nor debated is 110. So the answer would be E)110.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, E is 110, which is the maximum possible. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose that the 70 in the debate are all part of the 90 in the prom. Then, 90 students attended prom (including the 70 who debated), and 70 of them also debated. So 200-90=110 didn't attend either. That's correct.\n\nBut wait, another way to look at it is: the minimum number of students who attended at least one event is 90, so the maximum number not attending either is 200-90=110. So that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is E)110.\n",

So, the goal is to find the maximum number of students that didn't go to prom and didn't participate in the debate. So, I'm looking for the largest possible number of students who are outside both events.\n\nLet me break down the information. First, the total number of students is 200. So, 45% of 200 is the minimum number who went to prom. Let me calculate that: 45% of 200 is 0.45 * 200 = 90 students. So, at least 90 students went to prom.\n\nSimilarly, 35% of 200 is the minimum for the debating session. 0.35 * 200 is 70.

But wait, no, actually, to maximize the number outside, we need as few as possible to be in either event. Wait, but the question says at least 45% and at least 35% attended their respective events. So, the minimum number that attended prom is 90, and the minimum for debate is 70. But wait, if more attended, that would reduce the number outside, so to maximize the outside, we need the minimum number in each. Because that way, as few as possible are in either event, leaving more outside.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The question is about the maximum number who neither attended prom nor debated. So, that's the same as the total minus the number who attended prom, minus the number who debated, plus those who attended both (because they were subtracted twice). But since we're trying to maximize the number who neither attended, we need to minimize the number who attended either event or both. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the problem is that we can't have overlapping too much, because if more people are in both, that might affect the total. So, perhaps the best approach is to calculate the minimal number of students who attended either event, and then subtract that from 200 to get the maximum number who neither attended.\n\nWait, but wait, another approach is using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The number who attended prom or debate is at least the sum of each minus the overlap. But since we want to maximize the number who neither attended, we need to minimize the number who attended either, which would require maximizing the overlap.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nSo, the maximum number of students who neither attended prom nor debated is equal to 200 minus the number who attended prom, minus the number who debated, plus those who attended both. But to maximize this, we need to minimize the number of students who attended either event, which would require as much overlap as possible between the two groups.\n\nWait, but the minimum numbers are given for each event. So, the minimum number in prom is 90, and in debate is 70. If the overlap is as large as possible, then the total number attending either would be 90 + 70 - x, where x is the number who attended both. To minimize the total number attending either, x should be as large as possible. But what's the maximum possible x?\n\nThe maximum possible overlap is the smaller of the two groups. So, the maximum x can be 70, because the debate group is 70. So, if all 70 in debate were also in prom, then the total number attending either would be 90 + 0 = 90. Because 90 in prom, 70 in debate, but 70 also in prom, so 90 in total.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in that case, the number attending either event is 90. Then, the number who neither attended is 200 - 90 = 110. But wait, that would be the maximum possible, but let me check if that's allowed.\n\nWait, because the problem states that at least 45% attended prom (so 90), and at least 35% debated (70). So, if all 70 in debate were also in prom, that's allowed. Because that way, 90 students attended prom, which meets the minimum, and 70 debated, which meets their minimum.\n\nSo, the total number who attended either would be 90, leaving 200-90=110 who didn't attend either. So, 110 is the maximum possible. But wait, looking at the options, E is 110. So, is that the correct answer?\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the number of students in both events is 70, then the number in prom would be 90, which includes those 70. So, 90 >=70, which is fine. And the number in debate is 70, which is exactly the minimum. So, this seems acceptable.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Another approach is to calculate the minimal number of students who attended at least one event. The minimal number is the sum of the two minima minus the maximum possible overlap.\n\nSo, minimal number attending either event is 90 +70 - x, where x is the maximum possible overlap. The maximum x can be is 70, so 90+70-70=90. So, the minimal number attending either is 90, meaning the maximum who didn't attend either is 200-90=110.\n\nSo, yes, the answer should be 110, which is option E.\n",

Let me think again.\n\nSo, the maximum number of students who neither attended prom nor debated is equal to 200 minus the number who attended prom, minus the number who debated, plus those who attended both. But to maximize this, we need to minimize the number of students who attended either event, which would require as much overlap as possible between the two groups.\n\nWait, but the minimum numbers are given for each event. So, the minimum number in prom is 90, and in debate is 70. If the overlap is as large as possible, then the total number attending either would be 90 + 70 - x, where x is the number who attended both. To minimize the total number attending either, x should be as large as possible. But what's the maximum possible x?\n\nThe maximum possible overlap is the smaller of the two groups. So, the maximum x can be 70, because the debate group is 70. So, if all 70 in debate were also in prom, then the total number attending either would be 90 + 0 = 90. Because 90 in prom, 70 in debate, but 70 also in prom, so 90 in total.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in that case, the number attending either event is 90. Then, the number who neither attended is 200 - 90 = 110. But wait, that would be the maximum possible, but let me check if that's allowed.\n\nWait, because the problem states that at least 45% attended prom (so 90), and at least 35% debated (70). So, if all 70 in debate were also in prom, that's allowed. Because that way, 90 students attended prom, which meets the minimum, and 70 debated, which meets their minimum.\n\nSo, the total number who attended either would be 90, leaving 200-90=110 who didn't attend either. So, 110 is the maximum possible. But wait, looking at the options, E is 110. So, is that the correct answer?\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the number of students in both events is 70, then the number in prom would be 90, which includes those 70. So, 90 >=70, which is fine. And the number in debate is 70, which is exactly the minimum. So, this seems acceptable.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Another approach is to calculate the minimal number of students who attended at least one event. The minimal number is the sum of the two minima minus the maximum possible overlap.\n\nSo, minimal number attending either event is 90 +70 - x, where x is the maximum possible overlap. The maximum x can be is 70, so 90+70-70=90. So, the minimal number attending either is 90, meaning the maximum who didn't attend either is 200-90=110.\n\nSo, yes, the answer should be 110, which is option E.\n\n\nTo determine the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor participated in the debating session, we analyze the given data:\n\n1. **Total number of students**: 200.\n2. **Minimum number of students who attended the prom night**: At least 45% of 200, which is \\( 0.45 \\times 200 = 90 \\).\n3. **Minimum number of students who participated in the debating session**: At least 35% of 200, which is \\( 0.35 \\times 200 = 70 \\).\n\nTo maximize the number of students who neither attended the prom nor debated, we need to minimize the number of students who attended either event. This requires maximizing the overlap between the two groups. The maximum possible overlap is the smaller of the two groups, which is 70 (the number of students who debated). If all 70 students who debated also attended the prom, the total number of students who attended either event is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total attending either event} = 90 \\, (\\text{prom}) + 70 \\, (\\text{debate}) - 70 \\, (\\text{overlap}) = 90.\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of students who neither attended the prom nor debated is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number neither attending nor debating} = 200 - 90 = 110.\n\\]\n\nThis calculation satisfies the conditions of the problem, as it uses the minimum required attendees for both events and maximizes the overlap. Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is **110**.\n\nAnswer: E",
