      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is: If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent? The options are A)30%, B)40%, C)20%, D)10%, E)5%.\n\nHmm, I remember that percentage reduction involves figuring out how much the original number has been decreased, then calculating what percentage that decrease is relative to the original number. Let me think through the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the amount of reduction. The original number is 120, and it's reduced to 96. So the reduction is 120 minus 96. Let me do that subtraction: 120 - 96 equals... 24. Oh right, 24 is the amount reduced.\n\nNow, to find the percentage reduction, I think the formula is (Reduction / Original) multiplied by 100. So that would be (24 / 120) * 100. Let me calculate that.\n\nWait, 24 divided by 120. Hmm, 24 divided by 120. Well, 120 goes into 24 how many times? Oh, wait, 24 is a quarter of 96? No, wait, that's the reduced number. Wait, 120 divided by 5 is 24, right? Because 5 times 24 is 120. Oh wait, no, wait. 5 times 24 is 120? No, wait, 5 times 20 is 100, and 5 times 4 is 20, so 120. So 24 is 20% of 120. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 24 is 20% of 120? Let me check.\n\nWait, 10% of 120 is 12. So 20% would be 24. Oh right, yes. Because 10% is 12, so 20% is double that, 24. So the reduction is 24, which is 20% of 120.\n\nWait, but wait, wait a second. Because 120 times 0.2 is 24. So that's correct. So the percentage reduction is 20%.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 20%. So the answer should be C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can cross-check. If 120 is reduced by 20%, what's 20% of 120? 24, so subtracting that gives 96, which matches the problem. Yep, that's right.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the formula. The percentage decrease is ((Original - New)/Original) * 100. So that's (24/120)*100 = 20%. So yes, correct.\n\nI think I've got this right. So the answer is option C, 20%.\n",

So, first, I need to find out how much was reduced. The original number is 120, and it's now 96. So the amount reduced is 120 minus 96.\n\nLet me calculate that. 120 minus 96 equals 24.

Let's compute that. 24 divided by 120 is... wait, 24 divided by 120 is the same as 24/120. Let me simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 24. So 24 \u00f724 is 1, and 120 \u00f724 is 5. So 24/120 simplifies to 1/5.\n\nWait, 1/5 as a decimal is 0.2. Oh right, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. 0.2 *100 equals 20. So 20%.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 20%, so that must be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.
