      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about oarsmen's weights. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the average weight of 10 oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg when one of them is replaced. The person being replaced weighs 53 kg. I need to find the weight of the new man.\n\nAlright, averages. The average is the total divided by the number of people. So, initially, the average is let's say A kg. The total weight for all 10 oarsmen would be 10*A.\n\nWhen one person is replaced, the new average becomes A + 1.8. So the new total weight is 10*(A + 1.8) = 10A + 18.\n\nWait, but the number of oarsmen remains the same, right? So the only change is replacing one person's weight. So the difference between the new total and the old total is the new person's weight minus the old person's weight.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal before replacement: 10*A\nTotal after replacement: 10*(A + 1.8) = 10A + 18\n\nThe difference between the two totals is (10A +18) - 10A = 18 kg. That must be because the new man added 18 kg more than the old one.\n\nWait, so the new man's weight minus the old man's weight (53 kg) equals 18 kg. Because replacing him adds 18 kg to the total.\n\nSo, new man's weight = 53 kg + 18 kg = 71 kg.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 71. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. The average increases by 1.8 for 10 people, so the total increases by 10 * 1.8 = 18 kg. So yes, the new man must weigh 53 +18 =71 kg. That makes sense.\n",

The man being replaced weighs 53 kg. I need to find the weight of the new man.\n\nWait, the average increases by 1.8 kg. So, the total weight must have gone up. Because average is total divided by number. So, when one person leaves and another comes in, the total weight changes by the difference between the new person and the old one.\n\nRight, so the average for 10 people is originally, let's see, let me think. Let me denote the original average as A. So, the original total weight would be 10 * A. Then, after replacing one person, the new average is A + 1.8, so the new total is 10*(A + 1.8).\n\nThe difference between the new total and the old total is 10*(A + 1.8) - 10*A = 10*1.8 = 18 kg. So, the total weight increases by 18 kg.\n\nBut why? Because the new man added must weigh more than the one he replaced. So, the difference between the new man's weight and the old man's weight (53 kg) is equal to the total increase, which is 18 kg.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The total increase is 18 kg because each of the 10 people's average went up by 1.8, so 10*1.8 is 18.\n\nSo, if the new man's weight is X, then X - 53 = 18. Because the new man's addition increases the total by 18 kg.\n\nSo, solving for X: X = 53 + 18 = 71 kg.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 71. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through it again.\n\nOriginal total weight: 10A. When we replace one person, the new total is 10A - 53 + X. And the new average is (10A -53 + X)/10 = A + 1.8.\n\nSo, (10A -53 + X) = 10*(A + 1.8) = 10A +18.\n\nSo, 10A -53 + X = 10A +18. Subtract 10A from both sides: -53 + X =18. So X= 18 +53=71. Yep, same as before. So the new man weighs 71 kg.\n",
