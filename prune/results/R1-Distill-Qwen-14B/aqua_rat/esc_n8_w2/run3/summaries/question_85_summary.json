      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The problem says, \"The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5:3. What is its length now?\" And then there are five options to choose from: A is 18, B is 30, C is 6, D is 15, and E is 12.\n\nHmm, right. So the ribbon was 30 cm long, and it was reduced by a ratio of 5 to 3. Wait, I need to understand what that ratio means. Ratios can sometimes be a bit tricky. So when something is reduced in a ratio, I think it's like scaling down. So the original length is being scaled by this ratio.\n\nLet me think. Ratios can be used to compare quantities. So if the original length is reduced in the ratio 5:3, that probably means that 5 parts become 3 parts after reduction. So the original length corresponds to 5 parts, and the new length is 3 parts.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because when you reduce something by a ratio, you're making it smaller, right? So the original length is 30 cm, which is 5 parts. So each part must be 30 divided by 5, which is 6 cm per part. Then, the new length is 3 parts. So 3 times 6 is 18 cm. That would make the new length 18 cm. Looking at the options, option A is 18. So that's probably the answer.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure I'm interpreting the ratio correctly. Sometimes ratios can be presented in different ways. If the ratio is 5:3, it's the original to the new. So original is 5, new is 3. So yes, that's how I used it. So 5 parts become 3 parts.\n\nAlternatively, could it be that the ratio is the other way around? Like, the new length is 5 and the original is 3? But that wouldn't make sense because reducing the length would mean the new length is smaller, so 3 is smaller than 5. So if the original was 3 parts and the new is 5, that would mean the ribbon got longer, which contradicts the problem statement. So no, that can't be right. So the ratio is definitely original to new as 5:3.\n\nAnother way to approach this is by setting up a proportion. So if 5 parts correspond to 30 cm, then 3 parts correspond to x cm. So the equation would be 5/3 = 30/x. Wait, no, that's not right. Because if you set up the proportion as 5:3 = 30:x, then cross-multiplying gives 5x = 90, so x = 18. Yes, that matches what I thought before.\n\nWait, but ratios can sometimes be written as part:part or part:whole. But in this case, it's a reduction, so it's part to part. So the original is 5, new is 3. So 5 parts become 3 parts. So the calculation is correct.\n\nSo the original length is 30 cm, which is 5 parts. So each part is 6 cm. New length is 3 parts, which is 18 cm. So the answer is A)18.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think of another way. The ratio 5:3 implies that the new length is 3/5 of the original. So 30 cm multiplied by 3/5 is 18 cm. Yep, that makes sense. So definitely, the new length is 18 cm, which is option A.\n",
