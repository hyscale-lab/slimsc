      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question says, \"A number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. Find the number.\" Oh right, I think I remember something like this from algebra. It's about finding a number that's equidistant from two other numbers, right?\n\nWait, so the number is greater than 36 by a certain amount, and it's also less than 86 by the same amount. So, like, if I add that amount to 36, I get the number, and if I subtract it from 86, I also get the number. So maybe the number is exactly in the middle between 36 and 86?\n\nOh right, that's the midpoint concept. The number should be the average of 36 and 86. Let me calculate that. The average is (36 + 86) divided by 2. So 36 plus 86 is... let's see, 36 plus 80 is 116, and then plus 6 more is 122. So 122 divided by 2 is 61. So the number must be 61.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making any mistakes here. Let me think about it another way. Let's say the number is x. The problem states that x is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. So the difference between x and 36 is the same as the difference between 86 and x.\n\nSo mathematically, that would be x - 36 = 86 - x. Let me solve this equation. Adding x to both sides gives 2x -36 =86. Then adding 36 to both sides: 2x = 122. Dividing both sides by 2: x = 61. Yep, that checks out.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 61. So that's the correct answer.\n",

Find the number.\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, the wording is a bit tricky. It says the number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. So, I think this means that the difference between the number and 36 is the same as the difference between 86 and the number. Because if it's greater by a certain amount, that same amount is how much less it is than 86.\n\nSo, let me write that down. Let the number be x. Then, the amount by which x is greater than 36 is x - 36. And the amount by which it's less than 86 is 86 - x. Since these amounts are equal, I can set up the equation x - 36 = 86 - x.\n\nNow, solving for x. Let's add x to both sides to get rid of the negative x on the right. That gives me 2x - 36 = 86. Then, add 36 to both sides. 2x = 86 + 36, which is 122. So, x is 122 divided by 2, which is 61. So x is 61.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 61. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. If the number is 61, then how much greater is it than 36? 61 - 36 is 25. And how much less is it than 86? 86 - 61 is 25. Yep, that matches. So it's correct.\n",
