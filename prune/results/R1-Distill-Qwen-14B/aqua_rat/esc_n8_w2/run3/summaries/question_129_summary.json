      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but let's try to work through it step by step. The problem says that the difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000, and their sum is 1000. We need to find which pair of numbers fits this condition from the given options.\n\nHmm, I remember that when dealing with the difference of squares, there's a formula that might help. The formula is a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). Oh right! So maybe I can use that here.\n\nGiven that the sum of the numbers is 1000, which is a + b = 1000. And the difference of their squares is 256000, so a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 256000.\n\nUsing the formula, a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). We already know a + b is 1000, so plugging that in: 256000 = (a - b) * 1000. \n\nWait, so if I divide both sides by 1000, I get (a - b) = 256. So now I have two equations:\n1. a + b = 1000\n2. a - b = 256\n\nHmm, how do I solve these two equations? I think I can add them together. Let me try that. Adding equation 1 and equation 2:\n\n(a + b) + (a - b) = 1000 + 256\n2a = 1256\nSo a = 1256 / 2 = 628.\n\nWait, so a is 628. Then what's b? Since a + b is 1000, b = 1000 - a = 1000 - 628 = 372.\n\nSo the two numbers are 628 and 372. Let me check the options. Option B is 628 and 372, so that should be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's compute a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 with these numbers.\n\na\u00b2 is 628 squared. Let me calculate that. 600 squared is 360,000. 28 squared is 784. And then 2*600*28 is 33,600. So 628\u00b2 = (600 +28)^2 = 600\u00b2 + 2*600*28 +28\u00b2 = 360000 + 33600 +784 = 394,384.\n\nb\u00b2 is 372 squared. Let me see, 370\u00b2 is 136,900. 2\u00b2 is 4. 2*370*2= 1,480. So 372\u00b2 = (370+2)^2 = 370\u00b2 + 2*370*2 +2\u00b2 = 136900 +1480 +4 = 138,384.\n\nNow, the difference a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 is 394,384 - 138,384 = 256,000. Which matches the given value. So yes, the numbers are 628 and 372.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is exactly these numbers. So the correct answer should be B.\n",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000, and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The question is asking which pair of numbers is correct among the given options.\n\nHmm, the options are A) 600 and 400, B) 628 and 372, C) 640 and 360, D) None of these, E) Cannot be determined.\n\nAlright, so I need to find two numbers, let's call them x and y. The sum of x and y is 1000, so x + y = 1000. The difference between their squares is 256000, so x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 256000.\n\nWait, I remember that x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 can be factored into (x - y)(x + y). Oh right! So that might be useful here.\n\nGiven that, let me write down the equations.\n\nEquation 1: x + y = 1000\nEquation 2: x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 256000 \u2192 which is (x - y)(x + y) = 256000\n\nSince x + y is 1000, I can substitute that into equation 2.\n\nSo, (x - y) * 1000 = 256000 \u2192 x - y = 256000 / 1000 \u2192 x - y = 256.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\nx + y = 1000\nx - y = 256\n\nI can solve these two equations simultaneously. Let me add them together.\n\nAdding both equations:\n\n(x + y) + (x - y) = 1000 + 256 \u2192 2x = 1256 \u2192 x = 1256 / 2 \u2192 x = 628.\n\nThen, substituting x back into equation 1: 628 + y = 1000 \u2192 y = 1000 - 628 = 372.\n\nSo the two numbers are 628 and 372. Let me check the options. Option B is 628 and 372, so that's the answer. But wait, I should verify if their squares' difference is indeed 256000.\n\nLet me compute 628\u00b2 and 372\u00b2.\n\nFirst, 628 squared. Hmm, 600\u00b2 is 360,000. 28\u00b2 is 784. Then, using (a + b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2, so 628\u00b2 = (600 + 28)\u00b2 = 600\u00b2 + 2*600*28 + 28\u00b2 = 360000 + 33600 + 784. Let's add them up.\n\n360000 + 33600 is 393600. Then plus 784 is 394,384.\n\nNow, 372 squared. Again, 300\u00b2 is 90,000. 72\u00b2 is 5184. Using (a + b)\u00b2 again: (300 +72)\u00b2 = 300\u00b2 + 2*300*72 +72\u00b2. So 90000 + 43200 + 5184.\n\n90000 +43200 is 133200. Plus 5184 is 138,384.\n\nNow, subtract 138384 from 394384. 394384 - 138384. Let me calculate that.\n\n394384 minus 138384: 394384 - 130000 is 264384, then subtract 8384. Wait, that's 264384 -8384. 264384 -8000 is 256384, then minus 384 is 256,000. Oh, right! So the difference is exactly 256,000 as given.\n\nSo the correct pair is 628 and 372, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me check the other options just to make sure none of them accidentally also satisfy the conditions, although I don't think so.\n\nTake option C: 640 and 360.\n\nSum is 640 + 360 = 1000, which matches. Let's check the squares.\n\n640\u00b2: 640 is 64 *10, so 64\u00b2=4096, so 640\u00b2=409600.\n\n360\u00b2: 36\u00b2 is 1296, so 360\u00b2 is 129600.\n\nDifference: 409600 - 129600 = 280,000. But the problem says 256,000. So that's not correct.\n\nOption A: 600 and 400.\n\nSum is 1000. Squares: 600\u00b2=360000, 400\u00b2=160000. Difference is 200,000. Not 256,000. So wrong.\n\nSo option B is correct. Therefore, the answer is B.\n",

Then, using (a + b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2, so 628\u00b2 = (600 + 28)\u00b2 = 600\u00b2 + 2*600*28 + 28\u00b2 = 360000 + 33600 + 784. Let's add them up.\n\n360000 + 33600 is 393600.
