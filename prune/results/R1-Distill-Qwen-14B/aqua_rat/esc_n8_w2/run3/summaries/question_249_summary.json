      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me read it again. The question is asking for the sum of three consecutive integers whose product equals 727 plus 728 plus 729. The options are A)37, B)38, C)36, D)30, E)39.\n\nHmm, wait a minute. Let me break this down. First, I need to compute what 727 + 728 + 729 is. Let me add those numbers up. 727 plus 728 is 1455, and adding 729 to that gives me 1455 + 729. Let me calculate that: 1455 + 700 is 2155, then +29 makes 2184. So the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184.\n\nWait, no, wait. The question says the product of the three consecutive integers is equal to 727+728+729, which is 2184. So I need to find three consecutive integers whose product is 2184. Then, once I find those integers, I need to sum them up.\n\nBut wait, the question is phrased a bit differently. Let me make sure I understand. It says the product can be expressed as 727+728+729. So yes, product is 2184. So I'm looking for three consecutive numbers whose product is 2184, and then find their sum.\n\nSo, let's think about three consecutive integers. Let me denote them as n-1, n, n+1. Their product would be (n-1)*n*(n+1) = n(n\u00b2 -1) = n\u00b3 -n. So we have n\u00b3 -n = 2184.\n\nHmm, okay, I need to find an integer n such that n\u00b3 -n equals 2184. Let me think about possible values of n. Maybe I can estimate n by taking cube roots.\n\nThe cube of 12 is 1728, since 12*12=144, 144*12=1728. 13 cubed is 2197 (since 13*13=169, 169*13=2197). Oh wait, 2197 is just 13 cubed. But 2184 is a bit less than that. So 2184 is 13\u00b3 minus 13, perhaps? Let me check: 13\u00b3 is 2197, 2197 minus 13 is 2184. Yes! So n\u00b3 -n is 2184 when n is 13. Because 13\u00b3 = 2197, and 2197 -13 = 2184.\n\nSo that means the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, and 14. Because n is 13, so the numbers are 12,13,14. Now, the sum of these three numbers is 12 +13 +14. Let's calculate that: 12+13 is 25, plus 14 makes 39.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 39. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me compute 12 *13 *14 to see if it equals 2184. 12*13 is 156. 156*14: 156 *10 is 1560, 156*4 is 624. Adding them gives 1560+624=2184. Yes, that's correct. So the three numbers are 12,13,14, sum is 39. So the answer is E.\n\nBut wait, the options are A)37, B)38, C)36, D)30, E)39. So E is 39, which is the sum. So the correct answer should be E.\n",

And then there are five options to choose from: A)37, B)38, C)36, D)30, E)39.\n\nHmm, wait a minute. So the product of three consecutive integers is equal to the sum of 727, 728, and 729. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's calculate what 727 + 728 + 729 is. Maybe that will give me a number which is the product of three consecutive integers. Then I can find those integers and add them together to get the answer.\n\nAdding those three numbers: 727 + 728 is 1455, and adding 729 gives 2184. So the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184. Now I need to find three consecutive numbers whose product is 2184.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.

Maybe I can estimate the cube root of 2184 to get an approximate idea of what n could be.\n\nLet me think, the cube of 12 is 1728, and 13 cubed is 2197. Oh, wait! 13\u00b3 is 2197, which is just 13 more than 2184. So 13\u00b3 is 2197, so 2184 is 2197 -13. Hmm, but wait, 2184 is 13\u00b3 minus 13. So 2184 =13*(13\u00b2 -1). Let's see: 13\u00b2 is 169, minus 1 is 168. So 13*168 is 2184. Oh, wait, but 13*168 is 2184. So that would mean n is 13? Because the product is n(n\u00b2-1), which is 13*(13\u00b2 -1) = 13*168 = 2184. Yes, that works.\n\nSo the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, and 14. Because n is 13, so n-1 is 12, n is 13, n+1 is 14. So their sum is 12 +13 +14. Let me add that up: 12+13 is 25, plus 14 is 39. So the sum is 39.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because 12*13*14 is indeed 2184? Let me calculate that.\n\n12 *13 is 156. 156 *14: 156*10 is 1560, 156*4 is 624. Adding them gives 1560+624=2184.

Then 1455+729: 1455+700=2155, plus 29=2184. Correct.\n\nSo product is 2184. Looking for three consecutive integers whose product is 2184.\n\nWe assumed n=13, giving 12,13,14.
