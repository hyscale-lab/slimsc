      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because word problems can sometimes trip me up. Let me read it carefully and take it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about a hotel ordering newspapers. The cost varies depending on the day. On Sundays, each newspaper costs $4, and on the other days, it's $1 each. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as on the other days. The total weekly payment is $210. I need to find out how many newspapers they buy on Monday.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So, the days of the week are seven, right? But the newspaper cost is only different on Sunday compared to the rest. So, Sunday is special, and the other six days (Monday to Saturday) have the same cost per paper.\n\nWait, but the problem says the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as on the rest of the days. Oh, wait, does that mean twice as many as each of the other days, or twice the total of all the other days combined? Hmm, that's a crucial point.\n\nWait, let me think. If the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the week. Oh, maybe that means on Sunday, they order twice the number they order on any other single day. Or does it mean twice the number as the total for all the other days? Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. But I think the wording is that they order twice as many on Sunday as on the other days, so probably twice per day, not the sum.\n\nWait, wait, let me read it again. \"Twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Oh, wait, the rest of the days as a group, right? So on Sunday, they buy twice the total number bought on the other six days.\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Let me parse that sentence. \"Orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" So, the rest is plural. So, perhaps on Sunday, they buy twice as many as they buy on each of the other days. Or is it twice the sum of the other days?\n\nHmm, that's a point of confusion. Let me think. Suppose on each of the other days, they buy X newspapers. Then on Sunday, they buy 2X. So for the week, it's 6 days at X, and 1 day at 2X. Or perhaps, the rest of the days sum up to a total, and Sunday is twice that.\n\nWait, the wording is: \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" So, \"rest of the days\" refers to the other days, so the total number bought on all the other days. So, for example, if on the other days (Mon-Sat) the hotel buys T newspapers in total, then on Sunday they buy 2T.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So the total for Sunday is twice the total of the other days. So the total per week is T (Mon-Sat) plus 2T (Sunday) = 3T. So the total cost would be based on T and 2T.\n\nWait, but the cost is different on Sunday. So, the cost for the other days is $1 per paper, and on Sunday, it's $4 per paper. So let me model this.\n\nLet me let T be the total number of newspapers bought on the other six days (Mon-Sat). So, on each of those days, the number is T/6 per day, but perhaps that's not necessary. Because each of those days is bought at $1 each, so the cost for those is T * $1. On Sunday, they buy 2T newspapers, each at $4, so the cost is 2T *4.\n\nSo the total cost is T*1 + 2T*4 = T + 8T = 9T. And the total cost is $210. So 9T = 210. Then T = 210 /9. Let me calculate that: 210 divided by 9 is 23.333... Wait, that can't be right because the number of newspapers should be a whole number. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nLet me define x as the number of newspapers bought on each of the other days (Mon-Sat). So on each of these days, they buy x newspapers. So the total for Mon-Sat is 6x. On Sunday, they buy twice as many as they do on each of the other days, so that's 2x newspapers.\n\nWait, wait, but the problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" So the \"rest of the days\" is plural, meaning each day. So if on each of the other days they buy x, then on Sunday they buy 2x.\n\nSo the total newspapers bought on Sunday: 2x.\n\nNow, the cost calculation:\n\nFor the other six days: each day x newspapers at $1 each. So per day, cost is x * 1 = x. For six days, that's 6x.\n\nOn Sunday: 2x newspapers at $4 each. So cost is 2x *4 =8x.\n\nTotal cost: 6x +8x =14x. And this equals $210.\n\nSo 14x =210 \u2192 x=210 /14 \u2192 x=15.\n\nSo x is 15. So on each of the other days (Mon-Sat), they buy 15 newspapers. So on Monday, it's 15.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 15. So the answer should be A)15.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because earlier I thought maybe the setup was that Sunday is twice the sum of the other days, but that led to a fractional T, which can't be. So perhaps I should stick with this approach.\n\nLet me see:\n\nIf x is 15, then on Sunday they buy 2x =30 newspapers.\n\nCalculate the cost:\n\nOther days: 6 days *15 =90 newspapers. Cost: 90 *1 =90.\n\nSunday: 30 *4 =120.\n\nTotal cost: 90 +120=210. Which matches the given total.\n\nSo yeah, that works. So Monday's newspapers are 15. So the answer is A)15.\n",

Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as on the other days. The total weekly cost is $210. I need to find the number on Monday.\n\nHmm, let's think about variables. Let me denote the number of newspapers bought on a non-Sunday day as x. So on Monday, it's x, same for Tuesday, etc. But wait, the problem says \"the rest of the days of the week.\" So that's Monday through Saturday, I think. Wait, no, Sunday is the only day when the price is $4. So the rest are 6 days, each at $1. Or wait, the problem says \"the rest of the days,\" which I think is the other days besides Sunday. So the total days would be 6 days (Monday to Saturday) plus Sunday, making 7 days.\n\nWait, no, the way the problem is phrased: \"the rest of the days of the week\" would be all days except Sunday. So the hotel buys newspapers on all 7 days. So the rest of the days are 6 days, each at $1, and Sunday at $4.\n\nBut the problem says the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as the rest. So if on each of the other days they buy x newspapers, on Sunday they buy 2x. Because twice as much as each of the other days. Wait, or is it twice as much as the total of the other days? Oh, that's an important distinction.\n\nWait, the question says, \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Hmm. So does that mean Sunday is twice as much as each day, or twice as much as the sum of all the other days?\n\nI think it's the latter. Because if it's twice as much as the rest of the days (plural), that would mean the total on Sunday is twice the total of the other days. Let me think. For example, if each other day is x, then the other days sum to 6x. So Sunday would be 2*(6x) = 12x? Or is it 2x per day, making Sunday 2x and the others x each?\n\nWait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again: \"orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Oh, \"rest of the days\" is plural, so I think it refers to the total of all other days. So Sunday is twice the total of the other days.\n\nSo let me model this.\n\nLet\u2019s say the hotel buys x newspapers on each of the other days (Monday to Saturday). There are 6 days like that. So total for those days is 6x. Then on Sunday, it's twice that, so 2*(6x) = 12x.\n\nSo now, the cost each day would be: for the other days, each is $1, so each day's cost is 1*x. There are 6 days, so 6x * $1 = $6x. Sunday's cost is 12x newspapers at $4 each, so 12x *4 = $48x.\n\nTotal cost per week is 6x + 48x = 54x. But the problem says the total is $210, so 54x = 210. Solving for x: x = 210 /54. Let me calculate that.\n\n210 divided by 54. Hmm, 54 *3 is 162, 54*3.888... is 210. Wait, let me compute 54 * 3.888. 54 *3=162, 54*0.888 is about 54*(8/9)=48. So 162+48=210. So x is 3.888... That can't be right because you can't buy a fraction of a newspaper. So maybe I made a mistake in my initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem means that the hotel buys twice as many on Sunday as on any given day of the week (other than Sunday). So Sunday is 2x per day, and each other day is x. So Sunday is 2x, and the other 6 days are x each.\n\nThen, the total newspapers would be Sunday: 2x, others: 6x. But the cost would be Sunday: 2x *4 =8x, and the others:6x *1=6x. Total cost is 8x +6x=14x.\n\nSet that equal to $210:14x=210 \u2192 x=15.\n\nWait, that would mean x is 15. So on each of the other days, they buy 15 newspapers. So on Monday, the answer is 15, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check the other approach again because I'm a bit confused.\n\nIn the first approach, I assumed that Sunday's papers were twice the total of the other days. So 6x is the other days, Sunday is 12x. Cost becomes 6x*1 +12x*4 =6x +48x=54x=210 \u2192x=210/54\u22483.888, which doesn't make sense. So that approach is likely wrong.\n\nThe second approach assumes that on each of the other days, the hotel buys x papers, and on Sunday, 2x. So Sunday is twice per day, not twice the sum. So in this case, the total cost is 14x=210\u2192x=15. So the answer is 15, option A.\n\nWait, but wait, the question is about how many newspapers it buys on Monday. If x is 15, then Monday's purchase is 15, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the problem statement: \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days.\" The rest of the days is plural, so it could imply the sum. But in that case, the numbers don't come out as whole numbers, which suggests that the correct approach is that Sunday is twice as much as each day.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that the rest of the days are the same as each other. So if on each of the other days, it's x, then Sunday is 2x, and the total cost is:\n\nSunday: 2x *4 =8x\n\nOther days: 6 days * x *1 =6x\n\nTotal cost: 8x +6x=14x =210 \u2192x=15.\n\nSo yes, that makes sense. So Monday is x=15. So answer is A)15.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's plug back into the problem.\n\nSo x=15.\n\nSunday: 2x=30 papers. Cost:30 *4=120.\n\nOther days: each day 15, 6 days. 15*6=90. Cost:90 *1=90.\n\nTotal cost: 120+90=210. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is 15, which is option A.\n",

But in that case, the numbers don't come out as whole numbers, which suggests that the correct approach is that Sunday is twice as much as each day.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that the rest of the days are the same as each other. So if on each of the other days, it's x, then Sunday is 2x, and the total cost is:\n\nSunday: 2x *4 =8x\n\nOther days: 6 days * x *1 =6x\n\nTotal cost: 8x +6x=14x =210 \u2192x=15.\n\nSo yes, that makes sense. So Monday is x=15. So answer is A)15.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's plug back into the problem.\n\nSo x=15.\n\nSunday: 2x=30 papers. Cost:30 *4=120.\n\nOther days: each day 15, 6 days. 15*6=90. Cost:90 *1=90.\n\nTotal cost: 120+90=210. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is 15, which is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's denote the number of newspapers bought on each of the non-Sunday days (Monday to Saturday) as \\( x \\). Since the hotel buys twice as many newspapers on Sunday as it does on the rest of the days, the number of newspapers bought on Sunday is \\( 2x \\).\n\nThe cost of newspapers is $4 on Sunday and $1 on the other days. Therefore, the total cost for newspapers can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Cost on Sunday**: \\( 2x \\times 4 = 8x \\).\n2. **Cost on other days**: \\( 6x \\times 1 = 6x \\) (since there are 6 days from Monday to Saturday).\n\nThe total weekly cost is given as $210. Thus, the equation for the total cost is:\n\n\\[\n8x + 6x = 210\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n14x = 210\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{210}{14} = 15\n\\]\n\nThis means the hotel buys \\( x = 15 \\) newspapers on each of the non-Sunday days, including Monday. Therefore, the number of newspapers bought on Monday is \\( 15 \\).\n\nTo verify, the total cost is:\n\n- Sunday: \\( 2x \\times 4 = 30 \\times 4 = 120 \\)\n- Other days: \\( 6x \\times 1 = 15 \\times 6 = 90 \\)\n- Total: \\( 120 + 90 = 210 \\)\n\nThe calculations are consistent with the given total cost of $210. Hence, the hotel buys \\( 15 \\) newspapers on Monday.\n\n**Answer: A**",
