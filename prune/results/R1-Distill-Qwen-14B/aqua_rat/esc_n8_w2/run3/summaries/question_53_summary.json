      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. \n\nThe question says: Five dozen toys are packed in a box. Hmm, wait, I remember that a dozen is 12. So five dozen would be 5 times 12. Let me calculate that. 5 *12 is 60. Oh right, so each box has 60 toys. \n\nNext part: 98 boxes are kept in a tempo. I'm not exactly sure what a tempo is here, but I think it's a type of vehicle, maybe like a truck or a van used for transporting goods. So each tempo can carry 98 boxes. \n\nThe main question is: How many tempos can lift 29400 toys in one round? So I need to find out how many of these tempo vehicles are needed to carry a total of 29,400 toys in one trip.\n\nLet me break it down. \n\nFirst, each box has 60 toys. Each tempo can hold 98 boxes. So per tempo, how many toys can it carry in one round? That would be 60 toys/box multiplied by 98 boxes. Let me do that multiplication. \n\n60 * 98. Hmm, 60*100 is 6000, but since it's 98, that's 60*(100-2) = 6000 - 120 = 5880. So each tempo can carry 5,880 toys in one round. \n\nNow, the total number of toys to be carried is 29,400. I need to find out how many tempos are required to carry all of them. So I think I should divide the total number of toys by the number each tempo can carry. \n\nSo 29,400 divided by 5,880. Let me compute that. Hmm, 5,880 times 5 is 29,400 because 5,880 *5 = 29,400. Oh wait, so that would mean 5 tempos. \n\nWait, wait a second. Let me make sure. 5,880 *5 is 29,400. Yes, that's correct. So 5 tempos would carry exactly 29,400 toys. \n\nBut wait, sometimes in these problems, you have to consider whether it's a whole number. Like, if the division didn't come out even, you'd have to round up because you can't have a fraction of a tempo. But in this case, it's exactly 5, so that's straightforward. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 5. So the answer should be B.\n",

Got that.\n\nNext, each tempo carries 98 boxes. Wait, so each tempo can carry 98 boxes, and each box has 60 toys. So the number of toys per tempo is boxes per tempo multiplied by toys per box. So that's 98 boxes * 60 toys/box. Let me compute that.\n\n98 * 60. Hmm, 100 *60 is 6000, so subtract 2*60 which is 120, so 6000 - 120 = 5880.

Sometimes when I'm doing math quickly, I might slip up.\n\nSo five dozen is 5*12=60. Each box has 60 toys. Each tempo carries 98 boxes. So 98 boxes *60 toys = 5880 toys per tempo.
