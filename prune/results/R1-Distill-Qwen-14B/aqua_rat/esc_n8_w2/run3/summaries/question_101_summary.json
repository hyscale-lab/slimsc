      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about red and green sweets in a bag. The ratio of red to green is 3:4, and there are 120 green sweets. I need to find out how many red sweets there are. Hmm, ratios can be a bit tricky, but let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, so the ratio is 3:4 for red to green. That means for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green ones. So if I imagine them, maybe like 3 apples for every 4 oranges or something. But in this case, it's red and green sweets.\n\nThe problem says there are 120 green sweets. So I guess I need to figure out how the ratio relates to the actual numbers. Ratios often involve some kind of scaling factor. Like, if the ratio is 3:4, then the actual numbers could be 3k and 4k for some number k. Because 3k red and 4k green would keep the same ratio as 3:4.\n\nSo, if 4 parts correspond to 120 green sweets, then each part is 120 divided by 4. Let me calculate that: 120 \u00f7 4 is 30. Oh, so each part of the ratio is 30 sweets. That makes sense because 4 parts are 120, so each part is a quarter of that, which is 30.\n\nNow, since the ratio for red is 3 parts, the number of red sweets would be 3 multiplied by 30. Let me do that: 3 \u00d7 30 equals 90. So there should be 90 red sweets.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If red is 3 parts and green is 4 parts, and each part is 30, then red is 90 and green is 120. The ratio of 90:120 simplifies to 3:4 because both are divisible by 30. Yeah, that works. 90 divided by 30 is 3, and 120 divided by 30 is 4. So the ratio holds.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 90. So I think that's the correct answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given ratio of red to green sweets, which is 3:4. This means for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets. Let the number of red sweets be \\(3k\\) and the number of green sweets be \\(4k\\), where \\(k\\) is a scaling factor.\n\nThe problem states there are 120 green sweets. Since green sweets correspond to \\(4k\\), we set up the equation:\n\\[\n4k = 120\n\\]\nSolving for \\(k\\), we divide both sides by 4:\n\\[\nk = \\frac{120}{4} = 30\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the number of red sweets using the ratio \\(3k\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Number of red sweets} = 3k = 3 \\times 30 = 90\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.

Hmm, the ratio is given as 3:4 for red to green. So that means for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green ones. \n\nWait, the bag has 120 green sweets. I need to find out how many red sweets there are. So, how do I relate the ratio to the actual number of sweets? \n\nLet me think. Ratios can be converted into fractions, right? So the ratio 3:4 can be written as 3/4 for red to green. Or maybe it's better to think in terms of parts. Like, each part of the ratio represents a certain number of sweets.\n\nSo, the ratio 3:4 means there are 3 parts red and 4 parts green. Together, that's 3 + 4 = 7 parts in total. But wait, do I need the total? The problem doesn't give the total, so maybe I can find the value of each part instead.\n\nSince there are 4 parts green sweets and that equals 120, I can find out how much one part is worth. So, 4 parts = 120. To find one part, I divide 120 by 4. Let me do that: 120 /4 = 30. Oh, so each part is 30 sweets.\n\nNow, the number of red sweets is 3 parts. So that would be 3 * 30. Let's calculate that: 3 *30 =90. So there are 90 red sweets.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The ratio is red:green =3:4. So for every 4 green, 3 red. If 4 green =120, each unit is 30. Then red is 3*30=90. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 90. So the answer should be A.\n",
