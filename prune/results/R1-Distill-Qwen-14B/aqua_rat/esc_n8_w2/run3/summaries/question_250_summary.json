      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about the capacity of a tank, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Hmm, the question gives the dimensions as 8 meters by 6 meters by 2.5 meters. Wait, but wait, capacity usually refers to volume, right? So I should calculate the volume of the tank.\n\nLet me remember, the formula for the volume of a rectangular tank is length multiplied by width multiplied by height. So I can plug those numbers in. Let's see: 8m times 6m times 2.5m. Let me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, 8 multiplied by 6 is 48. Then, 48 multiplied by 2.5. Hmm, 48 times 2 is 96, and 48 times 0.5 is 24. So adding those together gives 96 + 24 = 120. So the volume is 120 cubic meters.\n\nWait, but the options are in liters, not cubic meters. I remember that 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 liters. Oh right, because 1 m\u00b3 = 1000 liters. So to convert cubic meters to liters, I multiply by 1000.\n\nSo 120 m\u00b3 would be 120 * 1000 liters, which is 120,000 liters. Let me check the options. Option D is 120,000 liters. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations. 8 * 6 is definitely 48. Then 48 * 2.5: 48 * 2 is 96, 48 * 0.5 is 24. So 96+24 is 120. Yeah, that's right. So 120 m\u00b3 is 120,000 liters.\n\nLooking at the options again, option D is 120,000 liters. So the correct answer should be D. But wait, none of the other options match that. So I don't think it's E (None of these) because option D is present.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Did I make a mistake in the conversion? Because 1 m\u00b3 is 1000 liters. So 120 m\u00b3 is 120,000 liters. Yeah, that seems right. So the answer is D.\n",
