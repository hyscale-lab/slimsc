      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about Sam's hard drive files and infections. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nAlright, the problem says there are 250 files, all infected by either a virus, a worm, or both. So that means every file has at least one infection. No file is completely clean. \n\nThe first piece of information is that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both. Let me write that down. So, if I let the number of files infected by both be B, then the number infected only by the worm would be 2.5B. Got that.\n\nNext, it says 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, 50% of 250 is 125 files. So those 125 files don't have a virus. But since all files are infected, these must be infected by a worm only. Because if a file isn't infected by a virus, it must be by the worm. Because all files are infected, right?\n\nWait, so the number of files infected only by the worm is 125. Oh, wait no. Because some files could be infected by both. But wait, the 50% not infected by a virus are only by the worm, because the other 50% are infected by the virus or both. Wait, no, let's think again.\n\nWait, the 50% not infected by a virus would be the files that are only worm-infected. Because any file not having a virus must have a worm. Because all are infected by at least one. So that's 125 files that are only worm-infected. \n\nSo, the number of files infected only by the worm is 125. But earlier, it was given that only by worm is 2.5 times the both. So 2.5B equals 125. Let me solve for B. \n\n2.5B = 125 \u2192 B = 125 / 2.5 = 50. So B is 50. That means 50 files are infected by both virus and worm.\n\nNow, let me figure out how many files are not infected by a worm. Wait, the question is asking for files not infected by a worm. Since all 250 are infected by virus or worm or both, the only way a file isn't infected by a worm is if it's infected only by the virus. So how many are only virus?\n\nLet me think about the total. The total number of files is the sum of only virus, only worm, and both. So total = only_virus + only_worm + both.\n\nWe know only_worm is 125, both is 50. So total is 250 = only_virus + 125 +50 \u2192 only_virus = 250 - 175 =75. So 75 files are only virus. \n\nBut wait, the question is asking how many files were NOT infected by a worm. Those are the files that are only virus, because if a file isn't infected by a worm, it must be only virus. So the answer is 75. Let me check the options. Option C is 75. \n\nWait, let me double-check. \n\nNumber of files not infected by a worm: that's only virus. We found that to be 75. \n\nAnother way: total files infected by worm = only worm + both = 125 +50=175. So files not infected by worm are 250-175=75. Yep, same answer. \n\nSo the correct answer should be 75, which is option C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that all 250 files are infected by either a virus, a worm, or both. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. Let the number of files infected by both be \\( B \\). Then, the number of files infected only by a worm is \\( 2.5B \\).\n\nNext, it is given that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Since there are 250 files, 50% of them is \\( 0.5 \\times 250 = 125 \\). These 125 files are not infected by a virus, meaning they are infected only by a worm. Therefore, \\( 2.5B = 125 \\). Solving for \\( B \\), we find:\n\n\\[\nB = \\frac{125}{2.5} = 50\n\\]\n\nThus, 50 files are infected by both a virus and a worm.\n\nNow, to find the number of files not infected by a worm, we need to determine how many files are infected only by a virus. The total number of files is the sum of files infected only by a virus, only by a worm, and by both:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total files} = \\text{Only virus} + \\text{Only worm} + \\text{Both}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n250 = \\text{Only virus} + 125 + 50\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Only virus} = 250 - 175 = 75\n\\]\n\nTherefore, 75 files are infected only by a virus.

Hmm, so every file has at least one of them. Got it. \n\nNext, it says the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. I'll need to represent that mathematically. Let me assign some variables.\n\nLet's let V be the number of files infected by both virus and worm. So, V is the overlap. Then, the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times V, so that's 2.5V. \n\nWait, but I should probably use more precise variables. Let me think: Let\u2019s denote:\n- V as the number of files infected by both virus and worm.\n- W as the number of files infected only by worm.\n- Vi as the number of files infected only by virus.\n\nWait, maybe I can use a Venn diagram approach here. Because it's about two overlapping sets: virus and worm.\n\nSo, the total number of files is 250, and all are infected by either virus or worm or both. So, the union of virus and worm is 250.\n\nWe know that W (only worm) is 2.5 times V (both). So W = 2.5 * V.\n\nAlso, the problem states that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. So, 50% of 250 is 125 files not infected by virus. That means those 125 files must be only infected by worm or neither, but wait, the problem says all files are infected by either virus or worm or both. So, the 125 files are only infected by worm. Because if a file isn't infected by virus, it must be only worm.\n\nWait, so the number of files not infected by virus is 125. Since all files are either virus or worm, the 125 must be only worm. So, W = 125?\n\nWait, no. Wait a minute. Let me think again. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. So, the files not infected by virus are those that are only worm. Because if a file isn't infected by virus, it can't be in the virus circle of the Venn diagram, so it's in the worm circle but not the overlap.\n\nSo, the number of files not infected by virus is W (only worm) plus those that are only worm and not virus. Wait, no. Wait, no, if a file isn't infected by virus, it can't be in the virus set. So, the only files not infected by virus are those in the worm set but not in the virus set. So that's W (only worm) plus the overlap? No, because the overlap is files that have both. So, if a file has both, it is infected by virus, so it's not in the 'not virus' group.\n\nTherefore, the number of files not infected by virus is W. So, W = 125. Oh wait, that can't be right because the total is 250.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The total number of files not infected by virus is 50% of 250, which is 125. These are the files that are only worm. So, W = 125.\n\nBut earlier, we have that W is 2.5 times V. So, 125 = 2.5 * V. So, V = 125 / 2.5. Let me calculate that.\n\n125 divided by 2.5. Well, 2.5 times 50 is 125. So, V is 50.\n\nSo, V is 50.\n\nNow, let's think about the total number of files. The total is the number of files infected by virus plus the number infected by worm minus the overlap. Or, in terms of the Venn diagram, total = (only virus) + (only worm) + (both). \n\nSo, total = Vi + W + V.\n\nBut another way: the number of files infected by virus is Vi + V. The number of files infected by worm is W + V.\n\nBut since all files are infected by either virus or worm, the union is 250.\n\nBut let's use the first approach. We have:\n\nVi + W + V = 250.\n\nWe already know W is 125, V is 50. So, Vi + 125 + 50 = 250.\n\nSo, Vi = 250 - 125 -50 = 75.\n\nSo, Vi is 75.\n\nWait, but the question is asking how many files were NOT infected by a worm. So, the files not infected by worm would be those not in the worm set. But since all files are either virus or worm or both, the only files not infected by worm are those that are only virus. Because any file in the worm set (only worm or both) is infected by worm.\n\nSo, the number of files not infected by worm is Vi, which is 75.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. So, Vi is 75.
