      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a club where the members' ages form an arithmetic progression (A.P.), and I need to find out how many members are in the club. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem states that the ages are in A.P. with a common difference of 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find the number of members. The options are given, so maybe I can plug them in later, but let's see if I can set it up with variables.\n\nFirst, I remember that in an A.P., the terms are like a, a + d, a + 2d, etc., where a is the first term and d is the common difference. Here, the first term a is 7 years, and d is 3 months. Wait, but I should make sure the units are consistent. Since a is in years and d is in months, maybe I should convert them to the same unit. Let me convert everything into months to avoid confusion.\n\n7 years is 7 * 12 = 84 months. The common difference d is 3 months. So each subsequent member is 3 months older than the previous one.\n\nLet me denote the number of members as n. So the ages in months would be 84, 84 + 3, 84 + 6, ..., up to the nth term.\n\nThe sum of an A.P. is given by the formula S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d]. But wait, since I converted everything into months, I should calculate the sum in months and then see if that's compatible with the given sum of 250. Wait, no, the sum is given as 250, but I'm not sure if that's in years or months. Let me check the question again.\n\nOh wait, the sum of the ages is 250. The options for the number of members are in the teens and twenties, so 18,20,25,26,27. So the sum is 250, but I need to make sure whether it's 250 years or 250 months. Hmm, that's an important point.\n\nWait, the problem states the sum of the ages is 250. Well, the individual ages are in years, I think. Because the youngest is 7 years old, so I think the sum is 250 years. Oh, but wait, when I converted to months, I was considering each term in months, so maybe I should calculate the sum in months and then convert it to years to match 250.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. Let's first consider that all the ages are in years. So the first term a is 7 years, common difference d is 3 months. Oh, wait, 3 months is 0.25 years (since 3/12 = 0.25). So d = 0.25 years.\n\nSo the sum S is given as 250 years. The formula for the sum of an A.P. is S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d]. So plugging in the values:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nSimplify that:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [14 + 0.25(n - 1)]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n [14 + 0.25(n - 1)]\n\nLet me compute 14 + 0.25(n-1):\n\n= 14 + 0.25n - 0.25\n= 13.75 + 0.25n\n\nSo 500 = n (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nExpanding that:\n\n500 = 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2\n\nLet's rearrange this into a standard quadratic equation:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n\nHmm, dealing with decimals can be a bit messy. Maybe I can multiply the entire equation by 4 to eliminate the decimal:\n\n4*(0.25n\u00b2) = n\u00b2\n4*(13.75n) = 55n\n4*(-500) = -2000\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check the multiplication. 0.25 *4 is 1, so n\u00b2. 13.75*4 is 55 (since 13*4=52, 0.75*4=3; 52+3=55). And 500*4 is 2000, but since it's -500, it becomes -2000. So yes, n\u00b2 +55n -2000 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let's use the quadratic formula: n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a), where a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nDiscriminant D = 55^2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025.\n\nSquare root of 11025 is 105, since 105*105 = 11025.\n\nSo n = [-55 \u00b1 105]/2.\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because the number of members can't be negative.\n\nSo n = ( -55 +105 ) /2 = 50/2 = 25.\n\nWait, that gives n=25. So looking at the options, option C is 25.\n\nBut wait, let me check if this makes sense. Let me plug n=25 back into the sum formula to see if the sum is indeed 250.\n\nSum S = 25/2 * [2*7 + (25-1)*0.25]\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n2*7 =14\n\n24 * 0.25 =6\n\n14 +6 =20.\n\nSo S = 25/2 * 20 = 25 *10=250. Which matches the given sum.\n\nSo the number of members is 25, which is option C.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, the options are A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27. So option C is correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider if I made a mistake in units. What if I calculated everything in months? Let's see.\n\nIf I don't convert d to years, but keep it in months, then I need to manage the units correctly.\n\nSo a=7 years =84 months, d=3 months.\n\nThe sum of the ages in months would be 250 years *12 months/year =3000 months.\n\nSum formula again: S = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]\n\nSo 3000 = n/2 [2*84 + (n-1)*3]\n\nSimplify:\n\n3000 = n/2 [168 +3(n-1)]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n6000 = n [168 +3n -3] \u2192 6000 =n [165 +3n]\n\nWhich is 3n\u00b2 +165n -6000=0.\n\nDivide equation by 3 to simplify:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nWait, that's the same quadratic as before! So same solution n=25. So regardless of the approach, I end up with n=25.\n\nSo the answer should be option C, 25.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a club where the members' ages form an arithmetic progression. Hmm, let me think about what I remember about arithmetic progressions. Oh right, an AP is a sequence where each term increases by a common difference. In this case, the common difference is 3 months. So each member is 3 months older than the previous one.\n\nThe problem says the youngest member is just 7 years old. So that's the first term of the AP. The sum of all the ages is 250. We need to find the number of members in the club, and the options are A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure I understand the units correctly. The common difference is 3 months, but the ages are in years. Oh, right! Because 3 months is a quarter of a year, so 0.25 years. So when I calculate the terms, I need to convert everything into the same unit, probably years, to make it consistent.\n\nSo, let's denote the number of members as 'n'. The first term, a1, is 7 years. The common difference, d, is 3 months, which is 0.25 years. So each subsequent term is a1 + (k-1)*d, where k is the term number from 1 to n.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula S = n/2 * [2a1 + (n-1)d]. Or another version is S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where an is the last term. Both should work.\n\nSo, plugging in the values I have:\n\nS = 250 = n/2 * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nLet me write that equation out:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nHmm, let me simplify the terms inside the brackets first. 14 is just 14, and 0.25(n-1) is 0.25n - 0.25. So adding them together gives 14 - 0.25 + 0.25n = 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 14 + (0.25n -0.25) equals 14 -0.25 + 0.25n which is 13.75 + 0.25n. Yeah, that's right.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nLet me expand the right side:\n\n500 = 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic equation. Let me rewrite it as:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 =0\n\nIt's easier to work with without decimals, so I'll multiply every term by 4 to eliminate the decimal coefficients:\n\n4*(0.25n\u00b2) = n\u00b2\n4*(13.75n) =55n\n4*(-500) =-2000\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 0.25 *4 is 1, so n\u00b2. 13.75*4 is 55, right. 13*4 is 52, 0.75*4 is 3, so 55. And -500*4 is -2000. Yes, correct.\n\nSo now, solving the quadratic equation n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0.\n\nI can use the quadratic formula. For ax\u00b2 +bx +c =0, solutions are (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)) / (2a).\n\nHere, a=1, b=55, c= -2000.\n\nSo discriminant D =55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000) =3025 +8000 =11025.\n\nWhat's the square root of 11025? Let's see, 105^2 is 11025 because 100^2=10000, 105^2=11025. Yes.\n\nSo sqrt(D)=105.\n\nSo solutions are (-55 \u00b1105)/(2*1).\n\nFirst, (-55 +105)/2 =50/2=25.\n\nSecond, (-55-105)/2 =-160/2= -80.\n\nBut since the number of members can't be negative, n=25 is the solution.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. Option C is 25. So that's the answer.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations. I think I may have made a mistake in the equation setup.\n\nWait, let me go back. So the sum S is 250 years, and each term is in years, and the common difference is 0.25 years.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a club where the members' ages form an arithmetic progression. Hmm, let me think about what I remember about arithmetic progressions. Oh right, an AP is a sequence where each term increases by a common difference. In this case, the common difference is 3 months. So each member is 3 months older than the previous one.\n\nThe problem says the youngest member is just 7 years old. So that's the first term of the AP. The sum of all the ages is 250. We need to find the number of members in the club, and the options are A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure I understand the units correctly. The common difference is 3 months, but the ages are in years. Oh, right! Because 3 months is a quarter of a year, so 0.25 years. So when I calculate the terms, I need to convert everything into the same unit, probably years, to make it consistent.\n\nSo, let's denote the number of members as 'n'. The first term, a1, is 7 years. The common difference, d, is 3 months, which is 0.25 years. So each subsequent term is a1 + (k-1)*d, where k is the term number from 1 to n.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula S = n/2 * [2a1 + (n-1)d]. Or another version is S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where an is the last term. Both should work.\n\nSo, plugging in the values I have:\n\nS = 250 = n/2 * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nLet me write that equation out:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nHmm, let me simplify the terms inside the brackets first. 14 is just 14, and 0.25(n-1) is 0.25n - 0.25. So adding them together gives 14 - 0.25 + 0.25n = 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 14 + (0.25n -0.25) equals 14 -0.25 + 0.25n which is 13.75 + 0.25n. Yeah, that's right.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nLet me expand the right side:\n\n500 = 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic equation. Let me rewrite it as:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 =0\n\nIt's easier to work with without decimals, so I'll multiply every term by 4 to eliminate the decimal coefficients:\n\n4*(0.25n\u00b2) = n\u00b2\n4*(13.75n) =55n\n4*(-500) =-2000\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 0.25 *4 is 1, so n\u00b2. 13.75*4 is 55, right. 13*4 is 52, 0.75*4 is 3, so 55. And -500*4 is -2000. Yes, correct.\n\nSo now, solving the quadratic equation n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0.\n\nI can use the quadratic formula. For ax\u00b2 +bx +c =0, solutions are (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)) / (2a).\n\nHere, a=1, b=55, c= -2000.\n\nSo discriminant D =55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000) =3025 +8000 =11025.\n\nWhat's the square root of 11025? Let's see, 105^2 is 11025 because 100^2=10000, 105^2=11025. Yes.\n\nSo sqrt(D)=105.\n\nSo solutions are (-55 \u00b1105)/(2*1).\n\nFirst, (-55 +105)/2 =50/2=25.\n\nSecond, (-55-105)/2 =-160/2= -80.\n\nBut since the number of members can't be negative, n=25 is the solution.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. Option C is 25. So that's the answer.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations. I think I may have made a mistake in the equation setup.\n\nWait, let me go back. So the sum S is 250 years, and each term is in years, and the common difference is 0.25 years. The formula I used is correct.\n\nWait, but let me plug n=25 back into the sum formula to see if it gives 250.\n\nSum = n/2 [2a1 + (n-1)d]\n\nn=25, a1=7, d=0.25.\n\nSum =25/2 [14 +24*0.25]\n\n24*0.25 is 6, so 14+6=20.\n\n25/2 *20 = (25 *20)/2 =25*10=250. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the number of members is 25, which is option C.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, C is 25.
