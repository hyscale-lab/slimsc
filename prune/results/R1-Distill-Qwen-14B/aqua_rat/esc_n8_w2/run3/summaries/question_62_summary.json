      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit confused at first glance, but let's try to break it down step by step. The question says, \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.\" Hmm, that's a bit tricky, but I think I can parse it.\n\nSo, let me rephrase it in my head. If Q is younger than R by a certain number of years, let's say x years, then Q is also older than T by the same x years. So, the difference between R and Q is x, and the difference between Q and T is also x. So, R is x years older than Q, and T is x years younger than Q.\n\nWait, wait. Let me write that down. Let's assign variables to their ages to make it clearer. Let's say Q's age is Q, R's age is R, and T's age is T.\n\nThe first part says Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. So mathematically, that would be R - Q = Q - T. Because if Q is younger than R by x, then R is Q + x, and T would be Q - x.\n\nSo, the equation is R - Q = Q - T. Let's rearrange that. Adding Q to both sides and adding T to both sides, I get R + T = 2Q. Oh, interesting. So, the sum of R and T is twice Q's age.\n\nBut the problem also states that the sum of R and T is 50 years. So, R + T = 50. From our earlier equation, R + T is 2Q, so 2Q =50. That means Q is 25 years old.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. So, the difference R - Q. From the initial setup, R - Q equals x, which is the same as Q - T. Since Q is 25, and R is Q + x, T is Q - x.\n\nBut wait, do we have enough information to find the value of x? Because R and T's sum is 50, and 2Q is 50, so Q is 25. Let me think about R and T's ages. R + T =50. And R is 25 + x, T is 25 - x.\n\nSo, substituting into R + T: (25 + x) + (25 - x) =50. 25+25 is 50, and x -x is 0. So 50=50, which is always true. That means x can be any value, but the sum is always 50. So, that doesn't help us find x.\n\nWait, but the question is about the difference between R and Q's age. R - Q is x, but x could be any positive number. So, without knowing more about R or T's individual ages, we can't determine the exact value of x. So, the difference could be any value, but the question is asking what is definitely the difference between R and Q's age.\n\nWait, but the options are specific numbers or D) cannot be determined. So, since x can be any value, the difference could be anything, but the question is asking for what is definitely the difference. Oh, but wait, the difference between R and Q is x, and the difference between Q and T is also x. But given that R + T is 50, and Q is 25, is there a way to find x?\n\nWait, no. Because R is 25 + x, T is 25 -x. So, R + T =50. But that doesn't give us any additional info about x. So, x could be 10, 20, 5, anything, as long as T doesn't become negative. So, T =25 -x must be positive, so x must be less than 25. So, the maximum x can be is 24, making T 1 year old, and R 49.\n\nBut without more info, we can't find the exact value of x. So, the difference between R and Q's age is x, which we can't determine from the given information.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?\" So, can we find any specific value?\n\nHmm, perhaps not. Because the given data allows for any x where x is less than 25. So, the answer would be D) Cannot be determined.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's recap:\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n1. Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R + T = 2Q.\n\n2. R + T =50.\n\nSo, 2Q =50 \u2192 Q=25.\n\nBut the difference between R and Q is R-Q = x, and Q-T =x. So, R=25 +x, T=25 -x.\n\nBut R + T =50 is always true, regardless of x. So, x can be any value, as long as T remains positive. So, x can be any value less than 25, but the problem doesn't provide any more constraints.\n\nThus, without knowing x, we can't determine the exact difference between R and Q's age. So, the answer is D) Cannot be determined.\n",

So, I think this means that the difference between Q's age and R's age is the same as the difference between Q's age and T's age, but in the opposite direction. Like, if Q is younger than R by a certain number of years, he's older than T by the same number of years.\n\nHmm, maybe I can put that into equations. Let me denote their ages as Q, R, and T. So the first part translates to R - Q = Q - T. Because R is older than Q by (R-Q), and Q is older than T by (Q-T), and these two differences are equal.\n\nThe second part of the problem says that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. So R + T = 50.\n\nWe need to find the difference between R and Q's age, which is R - Q. But wait, from the first equation, I know that R - Q is equal to Q - T.

Let me try plugging in some numbers.\n\nSuppose Q is 25. Then R must be older than Q by some x years, so R = Q + x. Then T is younger than Q by x years, so T = Q - x.\n\nSo R =25 +x, T=25 -x.\n\nThe sum of R and T is (25+x) + (25 -x) =50. Which checks out. But this doesn't give me any information about x.
