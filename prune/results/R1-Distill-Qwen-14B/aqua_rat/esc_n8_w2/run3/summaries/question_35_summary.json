      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangular solid inscribed in a sphere. Hmm, I remember that when a solid is inscribed in a sphere, all its vertices touch the sphere's surface. The sphere's diameter should be the same as the solid's space diagonal, right?\n\nWait, the solid is 3 x 4 x 15. So, the space diagonal can be found using the 3D version of the Pythagorean theorem. Oh right, the formula is sqrt(length\u00b2 + width\u00b2 + height\u00b2). Let me plug in the numbers.\n\nSo, length is 3, width 4, height 15. Squaring each: 3\u00b2 is 9, 4\u00b2 is 16, 15\u00b2 is 225. Adding them up: 9 + 16 is 25, plus 225 gives 250. The square root of 250 is... wait, 250 is 25 times 10, so sqrt(25*10) is 5*sqrt(10). Oh, sqrt(10) is approximately 3.1623, so 5 times that is about 15.8115.\n\nBut wait, the sphere's diameter is equal to the space diagonal, right? So the diameter is 5*sqrt(10), which is approximately 15.8113. Looking at the options, option B is 15.8113. So that must be the answer.\n\nWait, did I make any mistake here? Let me double-check. The space diagonal formula is correct for a rectangular solid. Yeah, because each vertex is connected through the edges, and the diagonal spans the cube's space. So the sphere's diameter is the diagonal's length. Yep, so the calculation seems right.\n",

All eight of its vertices are on the sphere, and I need to find the diameter of the sphere. Hmm, I remember that when a solid is inscribed in a sphere, the sphere's diameter is equal to the solid's space diagonal. Right, the space diagonal runs from one corner of the rectangular solid to the opposite corner, passing through the center of the sphere.\n\nSo, to find the space diagonal, I think I should use the formula for the diagonal of a rectangular prism. Wait, the formula is something like the square root of (length squared plus width squared plus height squared). Let me write that down: diagonal = sqrt(l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2). Oh wait, yeah, that's right. Because in three dimensions, each dimension contributes to the diagonal's length.\n\nGiven the dimensions are 3, 4, and 15, I'll plug those into the formula. So, first, I'll square each number. 3 squared is 9, 4 squared is 16, and 15 squared is 225. Then, I add them all together: 9 + 16 is 25, plus 225 makes 250. So the sum is 250. Then, I take the square root of 250.\n\nWait, what's the square root of 250? Let me think. I know that 15 squared is 225 and 16 squared is 256. So sqrt(250) must be between 15 and 16. Let me compute it more precisely. 250 is 25 times 10, so sqrt(25*10) is 5*sqrt(10). Oh wait, that's right because 250 = 25 *10. And sqrt(25) is 5, so it's 5 * sqrt(10).\n\nWhat's sqrt(10) approximately? I remember it's about 3.1623. So 5 times 3.1623 is 15.8115. Wait, but wait, that would be the space diagonal, which is the diameter of the sphere. So the diameter is approximately 15.8113. Looking at the options, option B is 15.8113.

So sqrt(250) is correct. And sqrt(250)=5*sqrt(10)\u22485*3.1623=15.8115, which matches option B.\n\nSo the diameter of the sphere is 15.8113, so the correct answer is option B.\n",
