      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where Arjun and Sajal are friends with some money, and I need to figure out how much each has. Hmm, let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe problem says two scenarios:\n\n1. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.\nWait, wait. Wait, Arjun gives $30 to Sajal. So after that, Arjun's money decreases by 30, and Sajal's increases by 30. Then Sajal's money is twice what Arjun has left. So I'll write that down.\n\nLet me assign variables. Let me call Arjun's money A and Sajal's money S.\n\nSo first scenario:\nAfter Arun gives $30 to Sajal:\nA becomes A - 30\nS becomes S + 30\nAnd at this point, S + 30 = 2*(A - 30)\nSo equation one is S + 30 = 2(A - 30)\n\nSecond scenario:\nIf Sajal gives $10 to Arjun. So Sajal's money decreases by 10, Arjun's increases by 10.\nThen Arjun's money is thrice what Sajal has left.\nSo:\nA becomes A + 10\nS becomes S -10\nAnd A +10 = 3*(S -10)\nSo equation two is A +10 = 3(S -10)\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1) S +30 = 2(A -30)\n2) A +10 = 3(S -10)\n\nI can solve these two equations to find A and S.\n\nLet me rewrite equation 1:\nS +30 = 2A -60\nSo, S = 2A -60 -30\nS = 2A -90\n\nEquation 2:\nA +10 =3S -30\nSo, A =3S -30 -10\nA =3S -40\n\nNow, substitute S from equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nFrom equation 1: S=2A -90. Substitute into equation 2.\n\nA = 3*(2A -90) -40\nLet me expand that:\n\nA = 6A -270 -40\nA =6A -310\n\nNow, subtract 6A from both sides:\n\nA -6A = -310\n-5A = -310\nDivide both sides by -5:\n\nA = (-310)/(-5) = 62\n\nSo Arjun has $62.\n\nNow, substitute A=62 into equation 1 to find S.\n\nS = 2*(62) -90\nS =124 -90 =34\n\nWait, that gives S=34. So Arjun has 62, Sajal has 34.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B is 62,34.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the options:\n\nA)62,35\nB)62,34\nC)34,62\nD)42,62\nE)62,42\n\nSo option B is 62 and 34. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait, let me go back through the steps.\n\nEquation 1 after Arun gives 30:\n\nS +30 = 2*(A -30)\n\nSo S = 2A -60 -30? Wait, wait, 2*(A-30) is 2A -60. So equation 1 is S +30 = 2A -60.\n\nSo moving 30 to the other side: S = 2A -60 -30? Wait no, 2A-60 is equal to S+30. So S = 2A -60 -30? No, that's not right.\n\nWait, equation 1:\n\nS + 30 = 2(A -30)\n=> S +30 = 2A -60\nSubtract 30 from both sides:\nS = 2A -60 -30\nS = 2A -90. Oh, that's correct.\n\nEquation 2:\n\nA +10 =3(S -10)\n=> A +10 =3S -30\nSo A =3S -30 -10 \u2192 A=3S-40. Correct.\n\nSubstituting S=2A-90 into A=3S-40:\n\nA =3*(2A -90) -40 \u2192 A=6A -270 -40 \u2192 A=6A-310.\n\nSubtract 6A: -5A= -310 \u2192 A=62. Correct.\n\nThen S=2*62 -90=124-90=34. So yes, S=34.\n\nSo the pair is Arjun has 62, Sajal has 34.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 62,34. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, let me check the scenarios again to make sure.\n\nFirst scenario: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal.\n\nArjun has 62-30=32, Sajal has 34+30=64. Does 64 equal twice 32? Yes, 64=2*32. Correct.\n\nSecond scenario: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun.\n\nArjun:62+10=72, Sajal:34-10=24. Does 72 equal thrice 24? Yes, 72=3*24. Correct.\n\nSo the calculations are correct. The answer is B.\n",

Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.\n\nAlright, the problem says that Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. There are two scenarios given. I need to find out how much each has. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst scenario: If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. Wait, wait, Arun is the same as Arjun, right? So, Arjun gives $30 to Sajal. After that, Sajal has twice as much as Arjun. Got it.\n\nSecond scenario: If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as what's left with Sajal. So, after Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun's money is three times Sajal's remaining money.\n\nLet me assign variables to make it easier. Let's say Arjun has A dollars and Sajal has S dollars.\n\nFirst scenario:\nArjun gives $30 to Sajal. So, Arjun's new amount is A - 30. Sajal's new amount is S + 30. According to the problem, Sajal now has twice what Arjun has. So:\n\nS + 30 = 2*(A - 30)\n\nThat's equation one.\n\nSecond scenario:\nSajal gives $10 to Arjun. So, Sajal's new amount is S - 10. Arjun's new amount is A + 10. Now, Arjun has thrice as much as Sajal. So:\n\nA + 10 = 3*(S - 10)\n\nThat's equation two.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n1. S + 30 = 2(A - 30)\n2. A + 10 = 3(S - 10)\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find A and S.\n\nLet me simplify both equations.\n\nEquation 1: S + 30 = 2A -60\nBring all terms to one side: S + 30 - 2A +60 =0 \u2192 S -2A +90 =0\nWait, maybe it's better to rearrange for S or A. Let me see.\n\nEquation 1: S = 2(A -30) -30\nWait, no. Let me expand equation 1.\n\nEquation 1: S +30 = 2A -60\nSubtract 30 from both sides: S = 2A -60 -30 \u2192 S = 2A -90\n\nSo equation 1 is S = 2A -90.\n\nEquation 2: A +10 = 3(S -10)\nExpand: A +10 = 3S -30\nBring all terms to left: A +10 -3S +30 =0 \u2192 A -3S +40 =0\nAlternatively, rearrange for A.\n\nFrom equation 2: A = 3(S -10) -10 \u2192 Let me check that.\n\nWait, equation 2 is A +10 = 3(S -10)\nSo A = 3(S -10) -10 \u2192 3S -30 -10 \u2192 3S -40.\n\nSo equation 2 is A = 3S -40.\n\nNow I have equation 1: S = 2A -90\nAnd equation 2: A =3S -40.\n\nHmm, substitution method. Let's substitute equation 2 into equation 1.\n\nFrom equation 2: A =3S -40 \u2192 substitute into equation 1.\n\nS = 2*(3S -40) -90\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nS = 6S -80 -90 \u2192 S =6S -170\n\nNow, subtract 6S from both sides:\n\nS -6S = -170 \u2192 -5S = -170 \u2192 5S =170 \u2192 S=34.\n\nSo Sajal has 34 dollars.\n\nNow, substitute S=34 into equation 2 to find A.\n\nEquation 2: A =3*(34) -40 \u2192 102 -40=62.\n\nSo Arjun has 62 dollars.\n\nWait, let me check if these values satisfy both equations.\n\nCheck equation 1: S +30 = 2(A -30)\n34 +30 = 64. On the right side, 2*(62-30)=2*32=64. So 64=64. Correct.\n\nCheck equation 2: A +10 =3(S-10)\n62+10=72. 3*(34-10)=3*24=72. 72=72. Correct.\n\nSo Arjun has 62, Sajal has 34. Looking at the options, option C is 34,62. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait the options are:\n\nOptions:\nA)62, 35\nB)62, 34\nC)34, 62\nD)42, 62\nE)62, 42\n\nSo option C is (34,62) which is Sajal=34, Arjun=62. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the question again. The options are: the first number is Arjun, the second is Sajal. Because the question says, \"how much money does each have?\" So the first is Arjun, second Sajal.\n\nSo in the options, option C is 34,62 which would mean Arjun is 34 and Sajal is 62. But according to my solution, Arjun is 62 and Sajal is 34. So that's option B.\n\nWait, no, wait the options:\n\nLooking again: the options are:\n\nA)62, 35 \u2192 Arjun 62, Sajal 35.\n\nB)62, 34 \u2192 Arjun 62, Sajal 34.\n\nC)34, 62 \u2192 Arjun 34, Sajal 62.\n\nD)42, 62\n\nE)62,42.\n\nWait, according to my solution, Arjun is 62 and Sajal is 34. So that's option B: 62,34.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, in the first scenario, Arun gives $30 to Sajal. So if Arjun is 62 and Sajal is 34:\n\nAfter transfer, Arjun has 62-30=32. Sajal has 34+30=64. 64 is twice 32. Correct.\n\nSecond scenario: Sajal gives 10 to Arjun. Sajal has 34-10=24. Arjun has 62+10=72. 72 is 3 times 24. Correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B: 62,34.\n",

Let me expand equation 1.\n\nEquation 1: S +30 = 2A -60\nSubtract 30 from both sides: S = 2A -60 -30 \u2192 S = 2A -90\n\nSo equation 1 is S = 2A -90.\n\nEquation 2: A +10 = 3(S -10)\nExpand: A +10 = 3S -30\nBring all terms to left: A +10 -3S +30 =0 \u2192 A -3S +40 =0\nAlternatively, rearrange for A.\n\nFrom equation 2: A = 3(S -10) -10 \u2192 Let me check that.\n\nWait, equation 2 is A +10 = 3(S -10)\nSo A = 3(S -10) -10 \u2192 3S -30 -10 \u2192 3S -40.\n\nSo equation 2 is A = 3S -40.\n\nNow I have equation 1: S = 2A -90\nAnd equation 2: A =3S -40.\n\nHmm, substitution method. Let's substitute equation 2 into equation 1.\n\nFrom equation 2: A =3S -40 \u2192 substitute into equation 1.\n\nS = 2*(3S -40) -90\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nS = 6S -80 -90 \u2192 S =6S -170\n\nNow, subtract 6S from both sides:\n\nS -6S = -170 \u2192 -5S = -170 \u2192 5S =170 \u2192 S=34.\n\nSo Sajal has 34 dollars.\n\nNow, substitute S=34 into equation 2 to find A.\n\nEquation 2: A =3*(34) -40 \u2192 102 -40=62.\n\nSo Arjun has 62 dollars.\n\nWait, let me check if these values satisfy both equations.\n\nCheck equation 1: S +30 = 2(A -30)\n34 +30 = 64. On the right side, 2*(62-30)=2*32=64. So 64=64. Correct.\n\nCheck equation 2: A +10 =3(S-10)\n62+10=72. 3*(34-10)=3*24=72. 72=72. Correct.\n\nSo Arjun has 62, Sajal has 34. Looking at the options, option C is 34,62. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait the options are:\n\nOptions:\nA)62, 35\nB)62, 34\nC)34, 62\nD)42, 62\nE)62, 42\n\nSo option C is (34,62) which is Sajal=34, Arjun=62. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the question again. The options are: the first number is Arjun, the second is Sajal. Because the question says, \"how much money does each have?\" So the first is Arjun, second Sajal.\n\nSo in the options, option C is 34,62 which would mean Arjun is 34 and Sajal is 62. But according to my solution, Arjun is 62 and Sajal is 34. So that's option B.\n\nWait, no, wait the options:\n\nLooking again: the options are:\n\nA)62, 35 \u2192 Arjun 62, Sajal 35.\n\nB)62, 34 \u2192 Arjun 62, Sajal 34.\n\nC)34, 62 \u2192 Arjun 34, Sajal 62.\n\nD)42, 62\n\nE)62,42.\n\nWait, according to my solution, Arjun is 62 and Sajal is 34. So that's option B: 62,34.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, in the first scenario, Arun gives $30 to Sajal. So if Arjun is 62 and Sajal is 34:\n\nAfter transfer, Arjun has 62-30=32. Sajal has 34+30=64. 64 is twice 32. Correct.\n\nSecond scenario: Sajal gives 10 to Arjun. Sajal has 34-10=24. Arjun has 62+10=72. 72 is 3 times 24. Correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B: 62,34.\n\n\nLet \\( A \\) represent the amount of money Arjun has, and \\( S \\) represent the amount of money Sajal has. The problem provides two scenarios to form equations:\n\n1. **First scenario**: If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.  \n   After the transfer:  \n   - Arjun has \\( A - 30 \\),  \n   - Sajal has \\( S + 30 \\).  \n   According to the problem, \\( S + 30 = 2(A - 30) \\).  \n   Simplifying:  \n   \\[\n   S + 30 = 2A - 60 \\implies S = 2A - 90 \\tag{1}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second scenario**: If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice the money left with Sajal.  \n   After the transfer:  \n   - Sajal has \\( S - 10 \\),  \n   - Arjun has \\( A + 10 \\).  \n   According to the problem, \\( A + 10 = 3(S - 10) \\).  \n   Simplifying:  \n   \\[\n   A + 10 = 3S - 30 \\implies A = 3S - 40 \\tag{2}\n   \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( A = 3S - 40 \\) from equation (2) into equation (1):  \n\\[\nS = 2(3S - 40) - 90\n\\]\n\\[\nS = 6S - 80 - 90 \\implies S = 6S - 170\n\\]\n\\[\nS - 6S = -170 \\implies -5S = -170 \\implies S = 34\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( S = 34 \\) back into equation (2):  \n\\[\nA = 3(34) - 40 = 102 - 40 = 62\n\\]\n\nThus, Arjun has $62, and Sajal has $34. Verifying with the scenarios:  \n1. After Arjun gives $30 to Sajal:  \n   - Arjun has \\( 62 - 30 = 32 \\),  \n   - Sajal has \\( 34 + 30 = 64 \\).  \n   Sajal has twice Arjun's money: \\( 64 = 2 \\times 32 \\).  \n\n2. After Sajal gives $10 to Arjun:  \n   - Sajal has \\( 34 - 10 = 24 \\),  \n   - Arjun has \\( 62 + 10 = 72 \\).  \n   Arjun has thrice Sajal's money: \\( 72 = 3 \\times 24 \\).  \n\nBoth conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the correct answer is **62, 34**.\n\nAnswer: B",
