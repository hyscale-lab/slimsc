      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Shweta riding her bike. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says she rides at 10 km per hour but stops for 10 minutes every 15 km. We need to find out how long it takes her to cover 100 km. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I think I should calculate how long she spends riding without any breaks. Since her speed is 10 km/h, the time taken to cover a certain distance is distance divided by speed. So, for each 15 km segment, she rides for 15/10 hours, which is 1.5 hours. That makes sense because 10 km would take an hour, so 15 km would take 1.5 hours.\n\nWait, but she stops after every 15 km. So every time she completes 15 km, she takes a 10-minute break. Hmm, I need to figure out how many times she stops. Let's see, she's going 100 km total. So how many 15 km segments are in 100 km?\n\n100 divided by 15 is about 6.666. So that's 6 full 15 km segments, and then a remaining part. Wait, let me check: 15 * 6 = 90 km. So she has 10 km left after that. So she would have done 6 stops, right? Because after each 15 km, including the 6th, she stops. But wait, after the 90 km, which is the 6th segment, she takes a break, but then she has 10 km left. So the next segment is 10 km, which doesn't require a stop because she doesn't reach another 15 km. So the number of breaks is 6, not 7.\n\nWait, wait, let me make sure. So for each 15 km, she stops once. So 15 km: stops once. 30 km: two stops. So up to 90 km, 6 stops. Then she does 10 km more, but since that's less than 15, she doesn't stop after that. So total breaks are 6 times 10 minutes.\n\nEach break is 10 minutes, which is 1/6 of an hour. So 6 breaks would be 6*(1/6) = 1 hour total break time. So that's 1 hour.\n\nNow, the total riding time. She covers 100 km at 10 km/h, which would be 100/10 = 10 hours. But wait, that's without considering the breaks. But wait, that's not right because she doesn't ride continuously. Because she's stopping after every 15 km, except for the last part.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. The riding time isn't just 10 hours because she's not moving during the breaks. So the riding time is the time she spends actually riding, which is the time for each segment plus the breaks.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: calculate the time for each 15 km segment plus the break, and then handle the remaining 10 km.\n\nSo each 15 km segment takes 1.5 hours to ride, plus 10 minutes break. So each segment takes 1.5 + 0.1667 hours (since 10 minutes is 1/6 hour, which is approximately 0.1667). Let me compute 1.5 + 1/6 = 1.5 + 0.1667 = 1.6667 hours per segment.\n\nWait, 1.5 is 3/2, and 1/6 is 1/6. Adding them together: 3/2 + 1/6 = (9/6 + 1/6) = 10/6 = 5/3 hours per segment. So each 15 km segment takes 5/3 hours.\n\nShe has 6 such segments (each 15 km) before the last 10 km. So the time for the first 6 segments is 6 * (5/3) = 10 hours. Because 6*(5/3) = (6/1)*(5/3) = 30/3 =10. So that's 10 hours for 90 km, including the breaks after each segment.\n\nThen, she has 10 km left. That takes 10/10 = 1 hour. No break after that because she's done. So total time is 10 + 1 = 11 hours.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. So 6 segments: each 15 km, 6*15=90. Then 10 km. So for the 6 segments, she takes 6 breaks, each 10 minutes. So 6*(10) = 60 minutes, which is 1 hour. So the riding time is 6*(1.5) + 1*(1) = 9 +1 =10 hours, plus 1 hour break, making total 11 hours.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer would be 11 hours. Looking at the options, option C is 11 hours.\n",

Anyway, the problem says she rides at 10 km per hour. But every 15 km, she stops for 10 minutes to rest. The question is asking how long she'll take to cover 100 km. The options are from 9 to 13 hours, so I need to figure it out step by step.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. First, her speed is 10 km/h, which means without any stops, the time she would take is total distance divided by speed. So 100 km divided by 10 km/h is 10 hours. But wait, she's stopping every 15 km for 10 minutes. So that's going to add extra time.\n\nI think I need to calculate how many times she stops and how much extra time that adds. So, every 15 km she stops for 10 minutes. Let me see, how many 15 km segments are in 100 km?\n\nLet me compute 100 divided by 15. That's about 6.666. But since she stops after each 15 km, she'll stop 6 times? Wait, wait. Let me think. If she completes 15 km, then she stops. So for the first 15 km, she rides, then stops. Then another 15, and so on.\n\nWait, but 15 km multiplied by 6 is 90 km. So she's done 6 segments, 90 km, and then she has 10 km left. Does she stop after the last segment? Because the problem says she stops at the end of every 15 km. So after each 15 km, she rests. So after 90 km (6 segments), she stops, then she rides the remaining 10 km. So she doesn't need to stop after the last 10 km because that's less than 15 km.\n\nSo she stops 6 times. Each stop is 10 minutes. So total stop time is 6 * 10 = 60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm. Let's say she goes 15 km, stops. Then another 15, stops again. So for each 15 km, a stop. So for 100 km, how many 15 km parts are there? Let's see: 100 / 15 is 6 with a remainder of 10. So she has 6 full 15 km segments, each followed by a rest stop. Then the last 10 km is not a full 15, so no stop after that.\n\nSo 6 stops, each 10 minutes. 6 *10 =60 minutes. So 1 hour added.\n\nSo the total time would be the riding time plus the stop time.\n\nRiding time is 100 km at 10 km/h, which is 10 hours. Plus 1 hour for stops. So 11 hours.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Because each 15 km, she stops. So for the first 15 km, she rides for 15/10 = 1.5 hours, then stops for 10 minutes. Then another 15 km, same thing.\n\nSo maybe I should compute the time per segment, including the stop, and then multiply by the number of segments, then add the time for the last partial segment.\n\nSo number of full segments is 6. Each segment is 15 km, taking 1.5 hours, plus 10 minutes (which is 1/6 of an hour, since 60 minutes is 1 hour). So per segment, it's 1.5 + 0.166666... hours.\n\nWait, 10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour (since 60 min/hour). So 1.5 + (1/6) = (9/6 + 1/6) = 10/6 = 5/3 hours per segment.\n\nWait, 5/3 is approximately 1.6667 hours per segment. So for 6 segments, that's 6*(5/3) = 10 hours. Then the last 10 km is 10 km /10 km/h = 1 hour. So total is 10 +1 = 11 hours.\n\nWait, but that doesn't match what I thought earlier. Wait, no, because earlier I considered 10 hours riding plus 1 hour stop, which is 11. So same result.\n\nWait, but according to the per-segment calculation, 6 segments: each 1.5h ride + 0.1666h stop. So 6*(1.5 + 0.1666) = 6 *1.6666 = 10 hours. Then the last 10 km is 1 hour. So total 10 +1=11.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the total time is 11 hours.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 11 hours. So the answer should be C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Suppose she does 15 km in 1.5h, then stops for 10 minutes. So 1.5h + 0.1666h = 1.6666h per 15 km.\n\nHow many 15 km are there in 100? 6 full, and 10 km left. So 6*(15) =90, plus 10 km.\n\nSo 6*1.6666h = 10h. Then 10 km is 1h. So 10 +1 =11h.\n\nYep, that seems right. So the answer is C, 11 hours.\n",

So 1.5h + 0.1666h = 1.6666h per 15 km.\n\nHow many 15 km are there in 100? 6 full, and 10 km left. So 6*(15) =90, plus 10 km.\n\nSo 6*1.6666h = 10h. Then 10 km is 1h. So 10 +1 =11h.\n\nYep, that seems right. So the answer is C, 11 hours.\n\n\nShweta rides at a speed of 10 km/h and stops for 10 minutes after every 15 km. To determine how long she takes to cover 100 km, we break the journey into segments.\n\n1. **Full Segments (15 km each):**  \n   There are \\( \\frac{100}{15} = 6 \\) full segments of 15 km.  \n   - Time to ride 15 km: \\( \\frac{15}{10} = 1.5 \\, \\text{hours} \\).  \n   - Time for rest after each segment: \\( 10 \\, \\text{minutes} = \\frac{1}{6} \\, \\text{hours} \\).  \n   - Total time per segment: \\( 1.5 + \\frac{1}{6} = 1.6667 \\, \\text{hours} \\).  \n   - Total time for 6 segments: \\( 6 \\times 1.6667 = 10 \\, \\text{hours} \\).\n\n2. **Remaining Distance (10 km):**  \n   After completing 6 segments (90 km), Shweta has 10 km left.  \n   - Time to ride 10 km: \\( \\frac{10}{10} = 1 \\, \\text{hour} \\).  \n\n3. **Total Time:**  \n   Total time = time for 6 segments + time for remaining 10 km.  \n   - \\( 10 + 1 = 11 \\, \\text{hours} \\).\n\nThus, Shweta takes **11 hours** to cover 100 km.  \n\nAnswer: C",
