      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again carefully. The question says that the price of a product is reduced by 30%, and then by what percentage should it be increased to make it 100%. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, I think I get it. So the product's price is first decreased by 30%, and then we need to find the percentage increase needed to bring it back to its original price, which I assume is 100% of the original price.\n\nWait, maybe the original price is 100, but after a 30% decrease, it's 70. Then, to get back to 100, how much do I need to increase 70 by? Because that's what the question is asking.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. Let's say the original price is $100 (using dollars as an example makes it easier). If the price is reduced by 30%, that means it goes down by 30% of 100, which is $30. So the new price is $70.\n\nNow, the question is asking, what percentage increase from $70 will bring it back to $100? Because 100% of the original price is what we're aiming for.\n\nSo, the formula for percentage increase is: ((Final Value - Initial Value)/Initial Value) * 100%. In this case, the initial value after the decrease is $70, and the final value we want is $100.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: ((100 - 70)/70) * 100% = (30/70)*100%. Let's compute 30 divided by 70. Hmm, 30 divided by 70 is approximately 0.42857. Multiply that by 100% gives about 42.857%. So that's approximately 42.86%.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 42.86%. So the correct answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes when dealing with percentages, it's easy to get confused between the base percentages. For instance, the percentage decrease is taken from the original price, but the increase is calculated based on the reduced price, not the original.\n\nSo, the key is that after the 30% decrease, the new base is 70. So, when calculating the percentage needed to get back to 100, the percentage is relative to 70, not 100.\n\nLet me calculate 30/70 again. 30 divided by 70 is 0.42857, which is approximately 42.86%, which matches option B. So I think I'm confident that B is the right choice.\n",

The product's price is reduced by 30%, and I need to find out by what percentage it should be increased to bring it back to 100% of the original price. The options are A through E, with various percentages.\n\nHmm, I remember that percentage changes can be a bit tricky because when you decrease and then increase, the base changes. So let's break it down. Let's imagine the original price is 100 units for simplicity. That makes the math easier because percentages will directly translate to numbers.\n\nIf the original price is 100, and it's reduced by 30%, then the new price is 70. Because 30% of 100 is 30, so subtracting that gives 70. Now, the question is, what percentage increase from 70 will bring it back to 100.\n\nWait, right. So the formula for percentage increase is: ((New Value - Original Value)/Original Value) * 100%. But in this case, the original value for the increase is 70, and the new value is 100.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. The difference between 100 and 70 is 30. So, 30 is what percentage of 70? So 30 divided by 70 equals approximately 0.42857. Multiplying by 100% gives 42.857%. Rounding that, it's about 42.86%. Looking at the options, B is 42.86%, so that must be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the bases. Oh yeah, because when you have a decrease, the base changes, so the percentage needed to get back isn't just 30% again. It's a higher percentage because you're adding to a smaller number.\n\nLet me think of another way. Suppose the original price is P. After a 30% decrease, the new price is P*(1 - 0.30) = 0.7P. Let's call this new price Q, so Q = 0.7P. We need to find the percentage increase x such that Q*(1 + x) = P.\n\nSubstituting Q, we get 0.7P*(1 + x) = P. Dividing both sides by P (assuming P isn't zero), we have 0.7*(1 + x) = 1. Then, dividing both sides by 0.7, we get (1 + x) = 1 / 0.7. Calculating 1 divided by 0.7, that's approximately 1.42857. Subtracting 1, x is approximately 0.42857, or 42.857%. So yes, same result.\n\nI think that's solid. So the correct answer is B) 42.86%.\n",
