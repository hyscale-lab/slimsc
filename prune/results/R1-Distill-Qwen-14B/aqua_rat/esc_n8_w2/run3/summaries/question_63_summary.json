      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 in a cab. The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and then 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much money I have left after the initial charge. The initial charge is $3.50, right? So if I start with $8.50, subtracting the first charge would give me the amount left for the additional distance. Let me calculate that: 8.50 minus 3.50 equals... 5 dollars. So, I have $5 left after the first quarter mile.\n\nNow, each additional quarter mile costs 10 cents. Wait, 10 cents is $0.10. I need to see how many of these I can buy with the remaining $5. So I'll divide 5 by 0.10. Let me do that: 5 / 0.10 is 50. Oh, so I can go 50 more quarter miles.\n\nBut wait, each of those is a quarter mile. So how many miles is that? A quarter mile is 0.25 miles. So I multiply 50 by 0.25. Let's see, 50 times 0.25 is 12.5 miles. Hmm, that's a lot.\n\nBut wait, I shouldn't forget the initial quarter mile. Because that's included in the first charge. So the total distance would be the initial 0.25 miles plus the additional 12.5 miles. Let me add those: 0.25 + 12.5 = 12.75 miles. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12.75 miles. So that should be the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: the total cost is 3.50 + 0.10 * (number of additional quarter miles). The total cost can't exceed $8.50. So the equation would be 3.50 + 0.10 * x \u2264 8.50. Subtracting 3.50 gives 0.10x \u2264 5. So x \u2264 50. So 50 additional quarter miles, which is 12.5 miles. Plus the initial 0.25, so 12.75 total. Yep, that matches.\n\nSo I think the answer is B, 12.75 miles.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50, start by subtracting the initial charge of $3.50 for the first quarter mile. This leaves you with $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00 for additional distance. Each additional quarter mile costs $0.10, so divide the remaining $5.00 by $0.10 to find the number of additional quarter miles:  \n\\[\n\\frac{5.00}{0.10} = 50 \\text{ quarter miles}.\n\\]  \nEach quarter mile is 0.25 miles, so multiply by 0.25 to find the additional distance:  \n\\[\n50 \\times 0.25 = 12.5 \\text{ miles}.\n\\]  \nAdd the initial quarter mile (0.25 miles) to the additional distance:  \n\\[\n0.25 + 12.5 = 12.75 \\text{ miles}.\n\\]  \nThus, the maximum distance you can travel is **12.75 miles**, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",
