      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about an appliance's price. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost. Then, the appliance was sold for 20% less than that original retail price. I need to find out what percent more the selling price is compared to the wholesale cost.\n\nWait, let me break this down. Maybe I should assign a variable to the wholesale cost to make it easier. Let's say the wholesale cost is W. Then, the original retail price is 60% more than W. So, how do I calculate that? Oh right, 60% more than W is W plus 60% of W, which is W*(1 + 0.60) = 1.60 * W. So the original retail price is 1.6W.\n\nNow, the appliance was sold for 20% less than this original price. So I need to calculate 20% off of 1.6W. Wait, 20% less than 1.6W is 1.6W minus 20% of 1.6W. Let me compute that. 20% is 0.2, so 0.2 * 1.6W = 0.32W. Subtracting that from 1.6W gives 1.6W - 0.32W = 1.28W. So the selling price is 1.28 times the wholesale cost.\n\nBut wait, the question asks what percent more than the wholesale cost the selling price is. So, the selling price is 1.28W, which means it's 28% more than W because 1.28 is 128% of W. Oh wait, because 1.00 is 100%, so 0.28 is 28% more.\n\nLet me double-check that. If W is $100, the original retail would be $160. Then 20% off that is $160 - $32 = $128. $128 is 28% more than $100. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nSo looking at the options, B is 28%, which should be the correct answer.\n",

Let's say the wholesale cost is W. Then the original retail price is 60% more than W. Oh right, so that's W plus 60% of W. So mathematically, that would be W * (1 + 0.60) = 1.60 * W. Got it.\n\nNow, the appliance was sold for 20% less than that original retail price. So the selling price is the original retail price minus 20% of it. So original retail is 1.60W, and 20% less would be 1.60W * (1 - 0.20) = 1.60W * 0.80.\n\nLet me calculate that. 1.60 multiplied by 0.80. Hmm, 1.6 * 0.8 is 1.28. So the selling price is 1.28 times the wholesale cost. Wait, because W was the wholesale cost.\n\nSo the selling price is 1.28W. Now, the question is asking by what percent this selling price is more than the wholesale cost. Since the wholesale cost is W, the selling price is 28% more than W. Because 1.28 is 128% of W, which is 28% more than 100% (W).\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have the selling price as 1.28W, then the increase from W is 0.28W. So 0.28W is the amount over W, so the percentage increase is (0.28W / W) * 100% = 28%. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 28%, so I think that's the correct answer.\n",
