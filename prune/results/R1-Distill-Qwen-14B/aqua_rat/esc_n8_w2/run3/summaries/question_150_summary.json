      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two trains crossing each other. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. \n\nAlright, the problem says train M leaves City A at 5 am and arrives in City B at 9 am. So that's a four-hour trip. Then there's train N which departs City B at 7 am and arrives in City A at 10:30 am. Wait, 10:30 is like 10 and a half hours after midnight, but the departure is at 7 am. So the duration for N is from 7 to 10:30, which is 3.5 hours. So N takes 3.5 hours to go from B to A, and M takes 4 hours from A to B.\n\nI think I need to find the time when they cross each other. That is, when they are at the same point on the tracks at the same time. \n\nLet me visualize this. Both trains are moving towards each other. So their speeds are relative. Maybe I should calculate the speeds of both trains first.\n\nBut wait, do I know the distance between the cities? No, the problem doesn't give it. Hmm, maybe I can assume the distance as a variable or find a way without knowing the exact distance.\n\nWait, let's denote the distance between A and B as D. That should help. \n\nSo for train M:\nIt travels D distance in 4 hours. So speed of M, let's call it Vm, is D/4 per hour.\n\nFor train N:\nIt travels D distance in 3.5 hours. So speed of N, Vn, is D/(3.5) which is the same as 2D/7 per hour, because 3.5 is 7/2, so 1/(3.5) is 2/7.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check: 3.5 hours is 7/2 hours. So D divided by (7/2) is D * 2/7. Yes, so Vn = 2D/7 per hour.\n\nNow, the trains start moving towards each other at different times. So I need to figure out when they meet. \n\nWait, when do they start moving? Train M leaves A at 5 am. So by the time train N leaves B at 7 am, how far has M gone?\n\nFrom 5 am to 7 am is 2 hours. So in those 2 hours, M has traveled Vm * 2 = (D/4) * 2 = D/2. So at 7 am, when N starts moving, M is already D/2 away from A, meaning they're D/2 apart from each other. Because the total distance is D, so the remaining distance between them is D - (D/2) = D/2.\n\nWait, no. Because M is moving towards B, and N is moving towards A. So at 7 am, M is D/2 into the journey, so the distance between M and N is D - (D/2) = D/2.\n\nNow, after 7 am, both trains are moving towards each other. So their relative speed is Vm + Vn. Because when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds.\n\nSo Vm is D/4, Vn is 2D/7. Let me compute that:\n\nD/4 + 2D/7 = (7D + 8D) / 28 = 15D/28 per hour.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me add them correctly. The denominators are 4 and 7. So common denominator is 28.\n\nD/4 = 7D/28, 2D/7 = 8D/28. So adding gives 15D/28 per hour.\n\nSo the relative speed is 15D/28 per hour. The distance between them at 7 am is D/2. So the time taken for them to meet after 7 am would be (D/2) divided by (15D/28).\n\nLet me compute that: (D/2) / (15D/28) = (1/2) * (28)/(15) = (28)/(30) = 14/15 hours.\n\nWait, 28 divided by 30 is 14/15, which is approximately 0.9333 hours. To convert that into minutes, 0.9333 * 60 \u2248 56 minutes.\n\nSo they meet 56 minutes after 7 am. \n\nWait, 56 minutes after 7 am is 8:04 am. But looking at the options, I don't see that. Wait, the options are:\n\nA)1 hr 23 min \u2192 8:23\nB)1 hr 15 min \u2192 8:15\nC)1 hr 8 min \u2192 8:08\nD)56 min \u2192 7:56? Or is it 7 am plus 56 minutes? Wait, the time is 56 minutes after 7 am, which is 8:04. Hmm. But the options don't have that. Wait, the options are presented as durations, perhaps. Let me read the options again.\n\nWait, the options are labeled as A to E, but the time each represents is a duration, not the actual clock time. Wait, no. Let me check the question again.\n\nThe question asks, \"At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?\" So the options are the time, but looking at the options, they're written as A)1 hr 23 min. Wait, that's confusing. Because 1 hr 23 min after what? Or is each option the time in hours and minutes past midnight? No, that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are in terms of how much time has passed since 5 am or 7 am? Or perhaps they are the time of the meeting in hours and minutes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think again. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the options are presented as:\n\nA)1 hr 23 min\n\nB)1 hr 15 min\n\nC)1 hr 8 min\n\nD)56 min\n\nE)55 min\n\nWait, but the times are presented as durations, but the question asks for the time they cross. So perhaps the options are the time since midnight? That would be confusing because the events are at 5 am, 7 am, etc. Alternatively, perhaps the options are the meeting time in hours and minutes past 5 am or 7 am.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: Let me consider the timeline.\n\nTrain M departs A at 5:00, arrives B at 9:00 \u2192 4 hours.\n\nTrain N departs B at 7:00, arrives A at 10:30 \u2192 3.5 hours.\n\nThey start moving towards each other, but not at the same time. So I need to find the time when they meet after 7:00.\n\nAt 7:00, M has been traveling for 2 hours, so it's D/4 * 2 = D/2 from A. So the distance between M and N is D - D/2 = D/2.\n\nNow, their speeds are Vm = D/4, Vn = D/(3.5) = 2D/7.\n\nRelative speed is Vm + Vn = D/4 + 2D/7 = (7D +8D)/(28) = 15D/28 per hour.\n\nTime taken to cover D/2 at 15D/28 per hour: time t = (D/2) / (15D/28) ) = (D/2) * (28)/(15D) )= 28/(2*15) = 28/30 = 14/15 hours.\n\n14/15 hours is 56 minutes. So they meet 56 minutes after 7:00 am.\n\nSo the meeting time is 7:00 + 56 minutes = 7:56 am.\n\nBut looking at the options, D is 56 min. So perhaps the answer is 56 minutes after 7 am, which is 7:56 am. But the options are written as durations, but perhaps they're indicating the minutes past a certain point. Alternatively, perhaps the options are in terms of time since midnight.\n\nWait, the options are presented as 'A)1 hr 23 min' which could be 1:23 am, but that doesn't make sense because the trains started earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the options are the time of the meeting in terms of the duration since the start of the journey of one of the trains.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me calculate the time each train has traveled until they meet.\n\nLet me denote t as the time after 7 am when they meet.\n\nAt that time, M has been traveling for t + 2 hours (since it started at 5 am), and N has been traveling for t hours.\n\nThe distance covered by M is Vm*(t+2) = (D/4)(t+2).\n\nThe distance covered by N is Vn * t = (2D/7)*t.\n\nSince they meet, the sum of these distances should be D.\n\nSo:\n\n(D/4)(t + 2) + (2D/7)t = D.\n\nDivide both sides by D:\n\n(1/4)(t +2) + (2/7) t = 1.\n\nMultiply each term by 28 (the least common multiple of 4 and 7) to eliminate denominators:\n\n7(t + 2) + 8t = 28.\n\nExpand:\n\n7t +14 +8t =28 \u2192 15t +14 =28 \u2192 15t=14 \u2192 t=14/15 hours.\n\n14/15 hours is 56 minutes. So yes, same as before.\n\nSo the meeting time is 7:00 + 56 minutes = 7:56 am.\n\nLooking back at the options, the options are given as:\n\nA)1 hr 23 min \u2192 8:23 am? Or 1 hour and 23 minutes after 7 am would be 8:23 am. But according to the calculation, it's 56 minutes after 7 am.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are the time in terms of hours and minutes after 5 am. Let's see:\n\n56 minutes after 7 am is 7:56 am, which is 56 minutes after 7. So in terms of time since 5 am, 7:56 is 2 hours and 56 minutes after 5 am. But that's not one of the options. The options don't have that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are the time in minutes past midnight. 7:56 am is 7*60 +56=476 minutes. Let's see the options:\n\nA)1 hr 23 min \u2192 83 min.\n\nB)1 hr 15 min \u219275 min.\n\nC)1 hr 8 min \u219268 min.\n\nD)56 min.\n\nE)55 min.\n\nBut 476 is not among these. So perhaps the options are not in that format.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the time they meet in terms of how long after one of the trains started. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the relative speed approach. Let me try another method.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model their positions as functions of time.\n\nLet\u2019s set t as the time in hours after 5 am.\n\nFor train M:\n- Leaves at t=0 (5 am), arrives at t=4 (9 am).\n- Position function: x_M(t) = Vm * t = (D/4) * t.\n\nFor train N:\n- Leaves at t=2 (7 am), arrives at t=5.5 (10:30 am).\n- So for t >=2, x_N(t) = D - Vn*(t-2), since it's moving towards A.\n\nWait, no. Because when t=2, N starts moving towards A, so its position decreases from D. So x_N(t) = D - Vn*(t-2). Because at t=2, it's at D, and as t increases, it moves towards A.\n\nWait, but the position function for N would be:\n\nx_N(t) = D - (D / 3.5) * (t - 2) for t >=2.\n\nBecause it takes 3.5 hours to cover D, so speed is D/3.5 = 2D/7.\n\nSo when do x_M(t) and x_N(t) meet? When x_M(t) = x_N(t).\n\nSo:\n\n(D/4) t = D - (2D/7)(t -2)\n\nWe can divide both sides by D:\n\nt/4 = 1 - (2/7)(t -2)\n\nMultiply both sides by 28 to eliminate denominators:\n\n7t = 28 - 8(t-2)\n\nExpand right side:\n\n7t = 28 -8t +16 \u2192 7t = 44 -8t \u2192 15t=44 \u2192 t=44/15 \u22482.9333 hours.\n\n44/15 hours is 2 hours and 56 minutes (since 0.9333 *60 \u224856 min).\n\nSo t is 2 hours and 56 minutes after 5 am. So the time is 5:00 + 2:56 = 7:56 am.\n\nSo again, 7:56 am.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)1 hr 23 min \u2192 1h23m = 83 min.\n\nB)1 hr 15 min \u2192 75 min.\n\nC)1 hr 8 min \u219268 min.\n\nD)56 min.\n\nE)55 min.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are the time after 5 am. So 7:56 am is 2h56m after 5 am. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I've misunderstood the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are the duration since midnight. 7:56 am is 7*60 +56 = 476 minutes. The options are way shorter than that, so that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)1 hr 23 min \u2192 83 minutes.\n\nB)1 hr 15 min \u219275 min.\n\nC)1 hr 8 min \u219268 min.\n\nD)56 min.\n\nE)55 min.\n\nHmm. So the correct answer according to my calculation is 56 minutes after 7 am. So the time is 7:56 am. But the options don't directly have 56 minutes; option D is 56 min.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are the time in minutes since 5 am? Let's see: 7:56 am is 2 hours and 56 minutes after 5 am. 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 56 is 176 minutes. But none of the options are near that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are the duration after 7 am. So 56 minutes after 7 is option D.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 56 min. So that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought the options are in terms of minutes since midnight, that didn't make sense. But perhaps the options are simply the duration after 7 am, in minutes. So 56 minutes after 7 am is 7:56, which would correspond to option D.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D)56 min.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the time when the two trains cross each other, we analyze their speeds and the distance between City A and City B.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two trains crossing each other. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. \n\nAlright, the problem says train M leaves City A at 5 am and arrives in City B at 9 am. So that's a four-hour trip. Then there's train N which departs City B at 7 am and arrives in City A at 10:30 am. Wait, 10:30 is like 10 and a half hours after midnight, but the departure is at 7 am. So the duration for N is from 7 to 10:30, which is 3.5 hours. So N takes 3.5 hours to go from B to A, and M takes 4 hours from A to B.\n\nI think I need to find the time when they cross each other. That is, when they are at the same point on the tracks at the same time. \n\nLet me visualize this. Both trains are moving towards each other. So their speeds are relative. Maybe I should calculate the speeds of both trains first.\n\nBut wait, do I know the distance between the cities? No, the problem doesn't give it. Hmm, maybe I can assume the distance as a variable or find a way without knowing the exact distance.\n\nWait, let's denote the distance between A and B as D. That should help. \n\nSo for train M:\nIt travels D distance in 4 hours. So speed of M, let's call it Vm, is D/4 per hour.\n\nFor train N:\nIt travels D distance in 3.5 hours. So speed of N, Vn, is D/(3.5) which is the same as 2D/7 per hour, because 3.5 is 7/2, so 1/(3.5) is 2/7.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check: 3.5 hours is 7/2 hours. So D divided by (7/2) is D * 2/7. Yes, so Vn = 2D/7 per hour.\n\nNow, the trains start moving towards each other at different times. So I need to figure out when they meet. \n\nWait, when do they start moving? Train M leaves A at 5 am. So by the time train N leaves B at 7 am, how far has M gone?\n\nFrom 5 am to 7 am is 2 hours. So in those 2 hours, M has traveled Vm * 2 = (D/4) * 2 = D/2. So at 7 am, when N starts moving, M is already D/2 away from A, meaning they're D/2 apart from each other. Because the total distance is D, so the remaining distance between them is D - (D/2) = D/2.\n\nWait, no. Because M is moving towards B, and N is moving towards A. So at 7 am, M is D/2 into the journey, so the distance between M and N is D - (D/2) = D/2.\n\nNow, after 7 am, both trains are moving towards each other. So their relative speed is Vm + Vn. Because when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds.\n\nSo Vm is D/4, Vn is 2D/7. Let me compute that:\n\nD/4 + 2D/7 = (7D + 8D) / 28 = 15D/28 per hour.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me add them correctly. The denominators are 4 and 7. So common denominator is 28.\n\nD/4 = 7D/28, 2D/7 = 8D/28. So adding gives 15D/28 per hour.\n\nSo the relative speed is 15D/28 per hour. The distance between them at 7 am is D/2. So the time taken for them to meet after 7 am would be (D/2) divided by (15D/28).\n\nLet me compute that: (D/2) / (15D/28) = (1/2) * (28)/(15) = (28)/(30) = 14/15 hours.\n\nWait, 28 divided by 30 is 14/15, which is approximately 0.9333 hours. To convert that into minutes, 0.9333 * 60 \u2248 56 minutes.\n\nSo they meet 56 minutes after 7 am. \n\nWait, 56 minutes after 7 am is 8:04 am. But looking at the options, I don't see that.

So they meet 56 minutes after 7:00 am.\n\nSo the meeting time is 7:00 + 56 minutes = 7:56 am.\n\nBut looking at the options, D is 56 min. So perhaps the answer is 56 minutes after 7 am, which is 7:56 am. But the options are written as durations, but perhaps they're indicating the minutes past a certain point. Alternatively, perhaps the options are in terms of time since midnight.\n\nWait, the options are presented as 'A)1 hr 23 min' which could be 1:23 am, but that doesn't make sense because the trains started earlier.

Or 1 hour and 23 minutes after 7 am would be 8:23 am. But according to the calculation, it's 56 minutes after 7 am.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are the time in terms of hours and minutes after 5 am. Let's see:\n\n56 minutes after 7 am is 7:56 am, which is 56 minutes after 7. So in terms of time since 5 am, 7:56 is 2 hours and 56 minutes after 5 am. But that's not one of the options. The options don't have that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are the time in minutes past midnight. 7:56 am is 7*60 +56=476 minutes.

So perhaps the options are not in that format.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the time they meet in terms of how long after one of the trains started. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the relative speed approach. Let me try another method.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model their positions as functions of time.\n\nLet\u2019s set t as the time in hours after 5 am.\n\nFor train M:\n- Leaves at t=0 (5 am), arrives at t=4 (9 am).\n- Position function: x_M(t) = Vm * t = (D/4) * t.\n\nFor train N:\n- Leaves at t=2 (7 am), arrives at t=5.5 (10:30 am).\n- So for t >=2, x_N(t) = D - Vn*(t-2), since it's moving towards A.\n\nWait, no. Because when t=2, N starts moving towards A, so its position decreases from D. So x_N(t) = D - Vn*(t-2). Because at t=2, it's at D, and as t increases, it moves towards A.\n\nWait, but the position function for N would be:\n\nx_N(t) = D - (D / 3.5) * (t - 2) for t >=2.\n\nBecause it takes 3.5 hours to cover D, so speed is D/3.5 = 2D/7.\n\nSo when do x_M(t) and x_N(t) meet? When x_M(t) = x_N(t).\n\nSo:\n\n(D/4) t = D - (2D/7)(t -2)\n\nWe can divide both sides by D:\n\nt/4 = 1 - (2/7)(t -2)\n\nMultiply both sides by 28 to eliminate denominators:\n\n7t = 28 - 8(t-2)\n\nExpand right side:\n\n7t = 28 -8t +16 \u2192 7t = 44 -8t \u2192 15t=44 \u2192 t=44/15 \u22482.9333 hours.\n\n44/15 hours is 2 hours and 56 minutes (since 0.9333 *60 \u224856 min).\n\nSo t is 2 hours and 56 minutes after 5 am. So the time is 5:00 + 2:56 = 7:56 am.\n\nSo again, 7:56 am.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)1 hr 23 min \u2192 1h23m = 83 min.\n\nB)1 hr 15 min \u2192 75 min.\n\nC)1 hr 8 min \u219268 min.\n\nD)56 min.\n\nE)55 min.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are the time after 5 am. So 7:56 am is 2h56m after 5 am. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I've misunderstood the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are the duration since midnight. 7:56 am is 7*60 +56 = 476 minutes. The options are way shorter than that, so that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)1 hr 23 min \u2192 83 minutes.\n\nB)1 hr 15 min \u219275 min.\n\nC)1 hr 8 min \u219268 min.\n\nD)56 min.\n\nE)55 min.\n\nHmm. So the correct answer according to my calculation is 56 minutes after 7 am. So the time is 7:56 am. But the options don't directly have 56 minutes; option D is 56 min.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are the time in minutes since 5 am? Let's see: 7:56 am is 2 hours and 56 minutes after 5 am. 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 56 is 176 minutes. But none of the options are near that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are the duration after 7 am. So 56 minutes after 7 is option D.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 56 min. So that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought the options are in terms of minutes since midnight, that didn't make sense. But perhaps the options are simply the duration after 7 am, in minutes. So 56 minutes after 7 am is 7:56, which would correspond to option D.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D)56 min.\n\n\nTo determine the time when the two trains cross each other, we analyze their speeds and the distance between City A and City B. Let the distance between the cities be denoted as \\( D \\).\n\n### Train M:\n- Departs City A at 5:00 am and arrives in City B at 9:00 am, taking 4 hours.\n- Speed of Train M:  \n  \\[\n  V_m = \\frac{D}{4} \\, \\text{per hour}.\n  \\]\n\n### Train N:\n- Departs City B at 7:00 am and arrives in City A at 10:30 am, taking 3.5 hours.\n- Speed of Train N:  \n  \\[\n  V_n = \\frac{D}{3.5} = \\frac{2D}{7} \\, \\text{per hour}.\n  \\]\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. By 7:00 am, Train M has already been traveling for 2 hours. In this time, it covers:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance covered by M} = V_m \\cdot 2 = \\frac{D}{4} \\cdot 2 = \\frac{D}{2}.\n   \\]\n   Thus, the distance between Train M and Train N at 7:00 am is:  \n   \\[\n   D - \\frac{D}{2} = \\frac{D}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n2. After 7:00 am, both trains are moving towards each other. Their relative speed is:  \n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{relative}} = V_m + V_n = \\frac{D}{4} + \\frac{2D}{7} = \\frac{7D + 8D}{28} = \\frac{15D}{28} \\, \\text{per hour}.\n   \\]\n\n3. The time taken for the trains to meet after 7:00 am is:  \n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{\\text{Distance between them}}{\\text{Relative speed}} = \\frac{\\frac{D}{2}}{\\frac{15D}{28}} = \\frac{D}{2} \\cdot \\frac{28}{15D} = \\frac{28}{30} = \\frac{14}{15} \\, \\text{hours}.\n   \\]\n   Converting \\( \\frac{14}{15} \\, \\text{hours} \\) to minutes:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{14}{15} \\cdot 60 = 56 \\, \\text{minutes}.\n   \\]\n\n### Meeting Time:\nThe trains meet 56 minutes after 7:00 am, which is at **7:56 am**.\n\n### Matching with Options:\nThe options are given as durations, and the correct answer corresponds to **56 minutes**, which matches option **D**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two trains crossing each other, and I'm supposed to figure out the time they meet. Hmm, let me try to break it down.\n\nAlright, let's see. Train M leaves City A at 5 am and arrives in City B at 9 am. So that's a four-hour trip. Train N leaves City B at 7 am and gets to City A at 10:30 am. So its trip takes, let's see, from 7 to 10:30 is 3 and a half hours, which is 3.5 hours.\n\nWait, I think I need to find out the speeds of both trains. Because if I know how fast each is going, I can figure out when they meet somewhere on the track between the cities.\n\nSo first, let's find the distance between the cities. Let's assume the distance is D. For train M, the time taken is 4 hours, so speed is D/4. For train N, the time is 3.5 hours, so speed is D/3.5. Wait, but 3.5 is 7/2, so D/(7/2) is 2D/7. So speed of M is D/4, and speed of N is 2D/7.\n\nNow, I need to find when they meet. Let's think about their positions over time. Train M starts at 5 am, and train N starts at 7 am. So when train N starts, train M has already been traveling for two hours.\n\nIn those two hours, how far has train M gone? Speed is D/4 per hour. So in 2 hours, it covers (D/4)*2 = D/2. So at 7 am, when train N starts, train M is halfway to City B.\n\nNow, from 7 am onwards, both trains are moving towards each other. So the distance between them at 7 am is D minus D/2, which is D/2.\n\nNow, I need to find the time it takes for them to cover this D/2 distance together. Since they're moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds.\n\nSpeed of M is D/4, speed of N is 2D/7. So adding them together: D/4 + 2D/7. Let me calculate that. Let's find a common denominator, which is 28.\n\nD/4 is 7D/28, and 2D/7 is 8D/28. So together, 7D +8D =15D/28. So their combined speed is 15D/28 per hour.\n\nThe distance between them at 7 am is D/2. So time taken to meet is (D/2) divided by (15D/28). Let me compute that.\n\n(D/2) / (15D/28) = (D/2) * (28/(15D)) )= (28)/(2*15) )= 28/30 = 14/15 hours.\n\nWait, 14/15 hours is how many minutes? 14/15 *60 = 56 minutes. So they meet 56 minutes after 7 am.\n\nSo 7 am plus 56 minutes is 7:56 am. But wait, the options are given in terms of time durations, not specific times. Hmm, let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions are:\nA)1 hr 23 min \u2192 83 min\nB)1 hr 15 min \u219275 min\nC)1 hr 8 min \u219268 min\nD)56 min\nE)55 min\n\nWait, but the problem says \"at what time do the two trains cross one another?\" So the answer should be the time they meet, which is 7:56 am. But the options don't list times; they list durations. Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I misread the options.\n\nWait the options are given as durations, but that can't be the case. Because the question is asking for the time, not the duration. Wait, perhaps the options are in minutes, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the options are the time in terms of how much after a certain point. Alternatively, perhaps the options are in minutes after 7 am.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the options are given as the time taken after a certain starting point, not the actual time. Hmm, maybe I should re-examine.\n\nWait, the question says \"At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?\" So the answer should be a specific time, like 7:56 am. But the options are in terms of time durations. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Unless I'm misunderstanding the options.\n\nWait the options are written as:\n\nA)1 hr 23 min \u2192 83 minutes\n\nB)1 hr 15 min \u219275\n\nC)1 hr 8 min \u219268\n\nD)56 min \u219256\n\nE)55 min \u219255\n\nWait, but 56 minutes is one of the options. So if the meeting happens 56 minutes after 7 am, that would make the time 7:56 am. So the duration after 7 am is 56 minutes. So the correct option is D.\n\nWait, but I thought the options are for the time, but maybe the options are giving the time after a certain point. Wait, the problem states \"At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?\" but the options don't include 7:56 am, but the duration after 7 am is 56 minutes. So if the options are D)56 min, which would be 56 minutes after 7 am, then the answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nDistance between the cities is D.\n\nTrain M takes 4 hours: speed is D/4.\n\nTrain N takes 3.5 hours: speed is D/(3.5) = 2D/7.\n\nAt 7 am, when N starts, M has been traveling for 2 hours, covering D/2.\n\nSo the distance between them is D - D/2 = D/2.\n\nTheir speeds towards each other: D/4 + 2D/7 = (7D +8D)/(28) )=15D/28 per hour.\n\nTime to meet: (D/2) / (15D/28) = (28/(2*15)) )=14/15 hours. 14/15 *60 =56 minutes.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the time they meet is 56 minutes after 7 am, which is 7:56 am. But the options don't give 7:56, but the duration after 7 am is 56 minutes, which is option D.\n\nSo the correct answer is D)56 min.\n",
