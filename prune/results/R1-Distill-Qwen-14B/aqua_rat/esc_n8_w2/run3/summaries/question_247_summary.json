      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. The area is 240 square meters. I need to find out how much fencing she needs.\n\nHmm, let's think about the rectangle. A rectangle has two pairs of equal sides. Let's say the sides are length and width. So, in this case, one of the sides is 10 meters, but which one? Wait, the problem says she's leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. So that side doesn't need fencing.\n\nWait, but wait. She's fencing three sides. So the fourth side is 10 meters and not fenced. So, if the yard is rectangular, the opposite sides are equal. So, if the unfenced side is 10 meters, then the opposite side (the one that's fenced) would also be 10 meters? No, wait, no. Because she's leaving one side unfenced, which is 10 meters. So the fencing is on the other three sides. Wait, but in a rectangle, there are two lengths and two widths. So perhaps the unfenced side is one of the lengths or one of the widths.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let me define the variables. Let's say the yard has a length (L) and a width (W). So, the area is L * W = 240.\n\nShe is leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. So either L or W is 10 meters. Let's assume that the unfenced side is the length, so L = 10 meters. Wait, but then the opposite side would be 10 meters, but she's fencing three sides, so that would include the other length and both widths. Or wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, she's fencing three sides. So if the unfenced side is one of the lengths, then she's fencing the other length and both widths. Alternatively, if the unfenced side is one of the widths, then she's fencing the other width and both lengths.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of which side is unfenced. So, she's not fencing a 10-meter side. So, the fencing is along three sides. Let me imagine the yard: she's fencing the front, left, and right sides, leaving the back (10 meters) unfenced. So, in that case, the front and back are the lengths, and the left and right are the widths. So, the back is 10 meters, so the front is also 10 meters. Then, the fencing would be front (10m) + left (W) + right (W) = 10 + 2W meters. But wait, no, because if the back is 10m, then the front is also 10m. But then the fencing is on the front, left, and right. So, that's 10 + W + W = 10 + 2W.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the unfenced side is a width. So, for example, the left side is 10m, unfenced. Then the front, right, and back are fenced. So, front is L, right is W, back is L. So total fencing is L + W + L = 2L + W.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's approach it step by step.\n\nLet me consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: The unfenced side is a length (L) of 10 meters.\n\nThen, the other length (front) is also 10 meters. The widths are W each. So, she's fencing the two widths and the other length. So fencing needed is L + 2W = 10 + 2W.\n\nThe area is L * W = 240. Since L is 10, W = 240 / 10 = 24 meters.\n\nSo fencing needed is 10 + 2*24 = 10 +48=58 meters. Hmm, that's one of the options (Option A).\n\nCase 2: The unfenced side is a width (W) of 10 meters.\n\nThen, the other width is also 10 meters. The lengths are L each. She's fencing the two lengths and one width. So fencing needed is 2L + W = 2L +10.\n\nThe area is L * W = 240. W is 10, so L = 240 /10 = 24 meters.\n\nFencing needed is 2*24 +10 =48+10=58 meters again. Wait, same number. Hmm, but that can't be right. Because the two cases should give different fencing requirements, but here both give 58.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the cases.\n\nIn case 1, unfenced side is length (L)=10 m. The fencing is L + 2W. So L=10, W=24, fencing is 10 + 2*24=58.\n\nIn case 2, unfenced side is width (W)=10 m. The fencing is 2L + W. So W=10, L=24. Fencing is 2*24 +10 =58. So same answer.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So regardless of whether the unfenced side is length or width, the fencing required is 58 meters. But that seems odd because the perimeter would be different, but in this specific scenario, both cases result in the same fencing. So the answer is 58 meters, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Did I mix up the sides in the fencing?\n\nIn case 1: fencing is L + 2W.\n\nWait, no, because if the unfenced side is a length (10m), then the fencing includes the other length and both widths. So yes, that's 10 + W + W = 10 + 2W. But if L is 10, W=24, so fencing is 10 + 48=58.\n\nIn case 2: unfenced side is W=10. So fencing is 2L + W (since two lengths and one width). L=24, so 2*24=48 +10=58. So both cases give 58.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because if the yard is longer in one dimension, wouldn't the fencing needed be longer? But perhaps in this specific case, the numbers work out so that both scenarios give the same fencing.\n\nSo the correct answer would be 58 meters, which is option A.\n",
