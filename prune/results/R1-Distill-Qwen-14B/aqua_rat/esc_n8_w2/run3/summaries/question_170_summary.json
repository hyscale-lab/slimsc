      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. I need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. Hmm, wait, the options are all just numbers of trousers, but the question asks for the ratio. Oh wait, maybe the options are giving the number of trousers, and we have to figure out the corresponding number of shirts to get the ratio.\n\nSo, the goal is to maximize the number of trousers. That means I should buy as many trousers as possible without exceeding the total amount of 810 rupees. Then, whatever money is left after buying the maximum number of trousers, I'll spend on shirts.\n\nLet me think. Each trouser costs 70, each shirt 30. Let me denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S.\n\nSo, the equation is: 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize T, so I'll start by finding the maximum possible T such that 70*T \u2264 810.\n\nCalculating 810 divided by 70. Let's see, 70 * 11 is 770. Because 70*10 is 700, plus 70 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So maximum T can be 11? Wait, but 70*11=770, which leaves 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333... So that's not a whole number. So we can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So the remaining money isn't enough for another shirt.\n\nWait, so if T is 11, S would be 40/30, which is 1.333. So that's not possible. So maybe T can't be 11. Hmm, perhaps I need to reduce T until the remaining amount is divisible by 30.\n\nLet's try T=11: 70*11=770, remaining 40. 40 isn't divisible by 30. So S would be 1 shirt (30) and 10 left, which isn't allowed. So that's no good.\n\nNext, T=10: 70*10=700. Remaining 110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... So not a whole number. So 3 shirts would take 90, leaving 20, which isn't enough for another shirt. So that's not possible.\n\nT=9: 70*9=630. Remaining 180. 180/30=6. So S=6. That works because 6 shirts cost 180. So that's a valid combination. So the ratio would be 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I can go even higher than T=11? No, because T=11 is 770, which is less than 810, but T=12 is 840, which is over. So 11 is the maximum possible T, but then the remaining money isn't enough for a shirt. So perhaps the next possible T is 10, but that leaves 110, which also isn't divisible by 30.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's think again. The problem says he spends exactly 810. So the total cost must be exactly 810. So 70T +30S=810. So we can write this as 7T +3S=81, by dividing both sides by 10. So 7T +3S=81.\n\nWe need to find integer solutions for T and S where T is as large as possible.\n\nSo, let's find T_max such that 7T <=81, and (81-7T) is divisible by 3. Since 7 and 3 are coprime, perhaps we can find T values.\n\nWait, 81 is divisible by 3, so 7T must also be such that 81-7T is divisible by 3. Let's see: 7T mod3 must equal 0, because 81 mod3 is 0. 7 mod3 is 1, so 7T mod3 = T mod3. So T must be a multiple of 3. So T can be 3,6,9,12... but 12 is beyond our maximum possible T.\n\nWait, what's the maximum T possible? 70*T <=810 \u2192 T_max = 810/70 \u224811.57 \u2192 T can be up to 11.\n\nSo possible T values are 3,6,9, but 9 is 9, 6 is 6, etc. Let's check:\n\nFor T=9: 7*9=63 \u2192 81-63=18 \u2192 S=18/3=6. So yes, 6 shirts. So that's possible. So the ratio is 9:6 \u2192 3:2.\n\nWait, but can I find a higher T than 9 that is a multiple of 3? Next multiple is 12, but that's beyond 11. So 9 is the maximum T possible in this scenario.\n\nWait, but earlier I tried T=11 and T=10, which aren't multiples of 3. Let me see what happens when T is not a multiple of 3.\n\nSo, if T=11, then 7*11=77. 81-77=4. So 4/3 is not an integer. So no solution. So S can't be 4/3.\n\nT=10: 7*10=70 \u2192 81-70=11 \u2192 11/3 \u22483.666, which isn't integer.\n\nT=8: 7*8=56 \u2192 81-56=25 \u2192 25/3 \u22488.333 \u2192 nope.\n\nT=7: 7*7=49 \u2192 81-49=32 \u2192 32/3\u224810.666 \u2192 no.\n\nT=6: 7*6=42 \u2192 81-42=39 \u2192 39/3=13 \u2192 S=13. So that's possible. So ratio is 6:13, but that's a lower number of trousers than 9.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought T=9 is the maximum possible, which gives S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut wait, another thought: perhaps the question is not about the ratio but the number of trousers. But the options are all numbers, so the correct answer would be 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, let me check the options again. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, it says the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased. So the ratio would be T:S.\n\nSo when T is maximum, which is 9, S is 6. So ratio is 9:6, which reduces to 3:2.\n\nBut the options are giving the number of trousers, so the correct option is A)9.\n\nWait, but in the options, the letters are A to E, each with a number. So the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. So the problem is about a man who spent 810 rupees buying trousers and shirts. Trousers are 70 each and shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. Hmm, the options are given as A to E, each representing a number of trousers, but I need to find the ratio, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question is a bit confusing. Oh wait, the options are just the number of trousers, but the question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt\" when the maximum number of trouser is purchased. So, perhaps the options are the possible maximum number of trousers, and from that, we can find the ratio.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me read it again. \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" Oh, so the ratio is between the number of trousers and shirts, and we need to find that ratio when he buys as many trousers as possible.\n\nSo, first, I need to figure out the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding 810 rupees. Then, with the remaining money, buy shirts. Then, the ratio of trousers to shirts will be determined.\n\nLet me think. So, the cost per trouser is 70, shirt is 30. Total amount is 810.\n\nSo, the maximum number of trousers is when the total spent on trousers is as much as possible without exceeding 810. So, divide 810 by 70 to find how many he can buy.\n\n810 \u00f7 70. Let's calculate that. 70 times 11 is 770 (because 70*10=700, plus 70 is 770). 70*11=770. 810 - 770 is 40. So, 40 rupees left. Now, can he buy shirts with 40? Each shirt is 30. So 40 \u00f730 is 1.333, which means he can buy one shirt, spending 30, leaving 10. But 10 isn't enough for another shirt, so only one shirt.\n\nWait, but wait, that would mean 11 trousers and 1 shirt. So the ratio is 11:1. But wait, let me check if 11 is the maximum possible.\n\nWait another way: 70 * 11 = 770. 810 -770=40. So 40 left. But can he buy more than 1 shirt? No, because 40 is less than 30*2=60. So only 1 shirt.\n\nBut wait, what if he buys 10 trousers? 10 *70=700. 810-700=110. 110 /30 = 3.666, so 3 shirts, 3*30=90. 110-90=20 left, which isn't enough for another shirt. So 3 shirts.\n\nSo, 10 trousers and 3 shirts. Ratio 10:3.\n\nWait, but the question is about the maximum number of trousers. So 11 is more than 10, so the maximum is 11. So the ratio would be 11:1.\n\nBut wait, let me check if 11 is possible. 70 *11=770, 810-770=40. He can't buy another shirt because 30 >40? No, 40 is more than 30. Wait, 40 is more than 30. So he can buy one shirt for 30, and have 10 left. So yes, 1 shirt.\n\nWait, but that's only one shirt. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut wait, what if there's a way to buy more shirts with the remaining 40? Because 40 is more than 30. So he can buy one shirt, but that's it. So 11 trousers, 1 shirt. Ratio 11:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nSo option E is 11. So the ratio would be 11:1. But the question is, what's the ratio of trouser to shirt when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So, that's 11:1.\n\nBut wait, the options are just the number of trousers. The question says, what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased? So, the options are the number of trousers, but the answer would be the ratio, but the options are giving only the number of trousers. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy, and that's the answer. Because the options are all numbers of trousers. So, the question is, when he buys the maximum number of trousers, what is the ratio of trousers to shirts. But the options don't list ratios; they list the number of trousers. So perhaps the correct approach is to find the maximum number of trousers, which is 11, so the answer is E)11 Trousers. But the question is about the ratio, so maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the initial problem statement says \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So, the ratio is required. But the options are numbers of trousers, not ratios. Hmm, that's conflicting. Unless the options are the number of trousers, and the ratio is just the count, so perhaps the ratio is the number of trousers bought. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, and the options are the possible maximum number of trousers, and the correct answer is E)11. Because that's the maximum number of trousers he can buy with 810.\n\nSo, perhaps the actual question is, what is the maximum number of trousers he can buy? Then the ratio is 11:1. But the options don't include that ratio, they just have the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the maximum number of trousers, not the ratio. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So, perhaps the ratio is between the number of trousers and shirts. So, when he buys the maximum number of trousers (11), he buys 1 shirt. So the ratio is 11:1. But the options don't have ratios, they have the number of trousers.

Let me restate:\n\nTotal amount: 810.\n\nEach trouser: 70.\n\nEach shirt:30.\n\nHe buys x trousers and y shirts.\n\nSo, 70x + 30y = 810.\n\nWe need to find the maximum x possible, which would be the highest integer x such that 70x \u2264810.\n\nSo, x_max = 810 //70.\n\nCalculating that: 70 * 11=770, 70*12=840>810. So x_max=11.\n\nSo, x=11, then 70*11=770. Remaining money: 810-770=40. So y=40//30=1, since 30*1=30 \u226440.\n\nSo, y=1. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers is 11, which is option E. So the answer is E.\n\nBut the question was about the ratio.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. So the problem is about a man who spent 810 rupees buying trousers and shirts. Trousers are 70 each and shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. Hmm, the options are given as A to E, each representing a number of trousers, but I need to find the ratio, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question is a bit confusing. Oh wait, the options are just the number of trousers, but the question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt\" when the maximum number of trouser is purchased. So, perhaps the options are the possible maximum number of trousers, and from that, we can find the ratio.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me read it again. \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" Oh, so the ratio is between the number of trousers and shirts, and we need to find that ratio when he buys as many trousers as possible.\n\nSo, first, I need to figure out the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding 810 rupees. Then, with the remaining money, buy shirts. Then, the ratio of trousers to shirts will be determined.\n\nLet me think. So, the cost per trouser is 70, shirt is 30. Total amount is 810.\n\nSo, the maximum number of trousers is when the total spent on trousers is as much as possible without exceeding 810. So, divide 810 by 70 to find how many he can buy.\n\n810 \u00f7 70. Let's calculate that. 70 times 11 is 770 (because 70*10=700, plus 70 is 770). 70*11=770. 810 - 770 is 40. So, 40 rupees left. Now, can he buy shirts with 40? Each shirt is 30. So 40 \u00f730 is 1.333, which means he can buy one shirt, spending 30, leaving 10. But 10 isn't enough for another shirt, so only one shirt.\n\nWait, but wait, that would mean 11 trousers and 1 shirt. So the ratio is 11:1. But wait, let me check if 11 is the maximum possible.\n\nWait another way: 70 * 11 = 770. 810 -770=40. So 40 left. But can he buy more than 1 shirt? No, because 40 is less than 30*2=60. So only 1 shirt.\n\nBut wait, what if he buys 10 trousers? 10 *70=700. 810-700=110. 110 /30 = 3.666, so 3 shirts, 3*30=90. 110-90=20 left, which isn't enough for another shirt. So 3 shirts.\n\nSo, 10 trousers and 3 shirts. Ratio 10:3.\n\nWait, but the question is about the maximum number of trousers. So 11 is more than 10, so the maximum is 11. So the ratio would be 11:1.\n\nBut wait, let me check if 11 is possible. 70 *11=770, 810-770=40. He can't buy another shirt because 30 >40? No, 40 is more than 30. Wait, 40 is more than 30. So he can buy one shirt for 30, and have 10 left. So yes, 1 shirt.\n\nWait, but that's only one shirt. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut wait, what if there's a way to buy more shirts with the remaining 40? Because 40 is more than 30. So he can buy one shirt, but that's it. So 11 trousers, 1 shirt. Ratio 11:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nSo option E is 11. So the ratio would be 11:1. But the question is, what's the ratio of trouser to shirt when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So, that's 11:1.\n\nBut wait, the options are just the number of trousers. The question says, what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased? So, the options are the number of trousers, but the answer would be the ratio, but the options are giving only the number of trousers. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy, and that's the answer. Because the options are all numbers of trousers. So, the question is, when he buys the maximum number of trousers, what is the ratio of trousers to shirts. But the options don't list ratios; they list the number of trousers. So perhaps the correct approach is to find the maximum number of trousers, which is 11, so the answer is E)11 Trousers. But the question is about the ratio, so maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the initial problem statement says \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So, the ratio is required. But the options are numbers of trousers, not ratios. Hmm, that's conflicting. Unless the options are the number of trousers, and the ratio is just the count, so perhaps the ratio is the number of trousers bought. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, and the options are the possible maximum number of trousers, and the correct answer is E)11. Because that's the maximum number of trousers he can buy with 810.\n\nSo, perhaps the actual question is, what is the maximum number of trousers he can buy? Then the ratio is 11:1. But the options don't include that ratio, they just have the number of trousers. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the maximum number of trousers, not the ratio. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So, perhaps the ratio is between the number of trousers and shirts. So, when he buys the maximum number of trousers (11), he buys 1 shirt. So the ratio is 11:1. But the options don't have ratios, they have the number of trousers.

So the first part is to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy, and then see what the ratio is.\n\nSo, let's think. He wants to buy as many trousers as possible. Each trouser is 70, so how many can he buy with 810?\n\nLet me calculate 810 divided by 70. Let's see, 70 times 11 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So maximum 11? But wait, 11 *70 is 770, which leaves 810-770=40. But each shirt is 30. So 40 can't buy a shirt because 30 is less than 40, but wait, he can buy one shirt for 30, leaving 10. But 10 is less than 30, so no more shirts. So in that case, the total spent is 770 +30=800, which is under 810. But wait, maybe he can buy more shirts with the remaining money? Let's see.\n\nWait, no, because 40 is left after buying 11 trousers. So he can buy 1 shirt (30) and have 10 remaining, which isn't enough for another shirt or trouser. So the total expenditure is 770+30=800. That's within 810. But he's only spent 800, leaving 10 unspent. But perhaps he can adjust the number of trousers to buy more shirts, but the question is about maximizing the number of trousers.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the maximum number of trousers, regardless of how much money is left? Or must he spend all 810? The question says \"spend 810 in buying,\" so I think he must spend exactly 810.\n\nAh, that's an important point. So he has to spend all 810. So let's think again. So he buys x number of trousers and y number of shirts, and 70x +30y=810.\n\nWe need to find integer solutions for x and y where x is as large as possible.\n\nSo the equation is 70x +30y=810. Let's try to solve for y in terms of x.\n\n70x +30y=810 \u2192 30y=810-70x \u2192 y=(810-70x)/30.\n\nWe need y to be an integer, so (810-70x) must be divisible by 30.\n\nAlternatively, 70x must leave a remainder such that when subtracted from 810, it's divisible by 30.\n\nLet me think about this. 70x mod 30. 70 mod 30 is 10. So 70x mod30= (10x) mod30. So 810 mod30 is 0, since 810/30=27.\n\nSo for (810 -70x) to be divisible by 30, 70x mod30 must be 0. So 10x mod30=0 \u2192 10x must be a multiple of 30 \u2192 x must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo x can be 3,6,9,12, etc., but we need x as large as possible such that 70x \u2264810.\n\nWait, let's find maximum x.\n\n70x \u2264810 \u2192 x \u2264 810/70 \u224811.57. So maximum integer x is 11.\n\nBut wait, x must be a multiple of 3 because of the earlier condition.\n\nSo the largest x less than or equal to 11 and a multiple of 3 is 9. Because 9*70=630, then 810-630=180. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So y=6.\n\nSo when x=9, y=6. Then the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut the question is about the maximum number of trousers, which in this case is 9. So the ratio is 9:6 or 3:2, but the options are just the number of trousers. So the correct option is A)9.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought x could be 11, but when x=11, 70*11=770, which leaves 40. 40 isn't divisible by 30, so y would be 40/30=1.333, which isn't an integer. So x=11 isn't allowed because y has to be integer.\n\nSo the next possible x is 9, which gives y=6, which is integer.

But also, since S has to be a whole number, because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt, I think.\n\nSo, the equation is 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nI can rearrange this to solve for S in terms of T. Let's see: 30S = 810 - 70T. Then S = (810 -70T)/30.\n\nSimplify that: S = (810/30) - (70T)/30. 810 divided by 30 is 27, and 70/30 is 7/3. So S = 27 - (7/3)T.\n\nBut S must be an integer because you can't have a fraction of a shirt. So (7/3)T must result in an integer when subtracted from 27. Alternatively, (70T) must be such that when subtracted from 810, the remainder is divisible by 30.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's think about the total amount. 70*T must leave a remainder that is a multiple of 30 when subtracted from 810. Because 810 -70T must be divisible by 30.\n\nSo, 810 mod 30 is 0, because 30 times 27 is 810. So 70T mod 30 must also be 0, because 810-70T has to be divisible by 30.\n\nSo 70T \u2261 0 mod 30. Let's compute 70 mod 30. 30*2=60, so 70-60=10. So 70 \u226110 mod30. So 70T \u226110T mod30. We need 10T \u22610 mod30.\n\nWhich simplifies to 10T must be a multiple of 30. So 10T =30k, where k is integer. So T must be 3k. So T has to be a multiple of 3. That's an important point.\n\nWait, so T can be 3,6,9,12, etc., but since the total money is 810, the maximum T can't be more than 810/70. Let's calculate that. 810 divided by 70 is 11.57. So T can be at most 11, but since it must be a multiple of 3, the possible Ts are 3,6,9,12? Wait 12*70 is 840, which is more than 810, so no. So max T possible is 11? But wait, 11 isn't a multiple of 3. So the next lower multiple of 3 is 9. So maximum T is 9.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check if T=11 is possible. Let's compute 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333... which is not an integer. So S would be 40/30 = 1.333, which isn't allowed. So T=11 isn't possible because S isn't an integer.\n\nSo the next possible T is 9, since 9 is a multiple of 3. Let me check T=9. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6. That's valid. So with T=9, S=6. So the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut wait, the options are just numbers of Trousers. The question is, what is the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the maximum T is 9. So the answer would be 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check if a higher T is possible. For example, T=10. Let's see. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666..., which isn't an integer. So S=3.666, which isn't allowed.\n\nHow about T=8? 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30 is 8.333..., not integer.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought T must be a multiple of 3, because 70T mod30=0, which implies T must be a multiple of 3. So the possible T's are 3,6,9, etc.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, since 9*70=630, 810-630=180, which is 6 shirts. So that's acceptable.\n\nWait, but what if T=12? 12*70=840, which is more than 810. So that's not possible.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9. So the ratio is 9 trousers to 6 shirts, which is 3:2. But the question is only about the number of trousers in the ratio, or the ratio of the count of trousers to shirts.\n\nWait, the question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So it's T:S. So 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options are just numbers, like 9,8, etc., so perhaps the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me test T=9, S=6.\n\n70*9=630, 30*6=180. 630+180=810. Perfect.\n\nWhat about T=10? 70*10=700, 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666, which isn't an integer. So no.\n\nWhat about T=12? 840, which is over 810. So no.\n\nSo the maximum number of T is 9. So the answer is A)9 Trousers.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem here. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options given are all different numbers of trousers, like 9, 8, etc.\n\nHmm, wait, I think I need to figure out how many of each he bought so that he spends exactly 810, and the number of trousers is as high as possible. Because the question is about the maximum number of trousers, right?\n\nSo, let me think. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. The total cost would be 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize T, which means we want as many T as possible without exceeding the total amount. But also, since S has to be a whole number, because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt, I think.\n\nSo, the equation is 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nI can rearrange this to solve for S in terms of T. Let's see: 30S = 810 - 70T. Then S = (810 -70T)/30.\n\nSimplify that: S = (810/30) - (70T)/30. 810 divided by 30 is 27, and 70/30 is 7/3. So S = 27 - (7/3)T.\n\nBut S must be an integer because you can't have a fraction of a shirt. So (7/3)T must result in an integer when subtracted from 27. Alternatively, (70T) must be such that when subtracted from 810, the remainder is divisible by 30.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's think about the total amount. 70*T must leave a remainder that is a multiple of 30 when subtracted from 810. Because 810 -70T must be divisible by 30.\n\nSo, 810 mod 30 is 0, because 30 times 27 is 810. So 70T mod 30 must also be 0, because 810-70T has to be divisible by 30.\n\nSo 70T \u2261 0 mod 30. Let's compute 70 mod 30. 30*2=60, so 70-60=10. So 70 \u226110 mod30. So 70T \u226110T mod30. We need 10T \u22610 mod30.\n\nWhich simplifies to 10T must be a multiple of 30. So 10T =30k, where k is integer. So T must be 3k. So T has to be a multiple of 3. That's an important point.\n\nWait, so T can be 3,6,9,12, etc., but since the total money is 810, the maximum T can't be more than 810/70. Let's calculate that. 810 divided by 70 is 11.57. So T can be at most 11, but since it must be a multiple of 3, the possible Ts are 3,6,9,12? Wait 12*70 is 840, which is more than 810, so no. So max T possible is 11? But wait, 11 isn't a multiple of 3. So the next lower multiple of 3 is 9. So maximum T is 9.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check if T=11 is possible. Let's compute 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333... which is not an integer. So S would be 40/30 = 1.333, which isn't allowed. So T=11 isn't possible because S isn't an integer.\n\nSo the next possible T is 9, since 9 is a multiple of 3. Let me check T=9. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6. That's valid. So with T=9, S=6. So the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut wait, the options are just numbers of Trousers. The question is, what is the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the maximum T is 9. So the answer would be 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check if a higher T is possible. For example, T=10. Let's see. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666..., which isn't an integer. So S=3.666, which isn't allowed.\n\nHow about T=8? 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30 is 8.333..., not integer.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought T must be a multiple of 3, because 70T mod30=0, which implies T must be a multiple of 3. So the possible T's are 3,6,9, etc.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, since 9*70=630, 810-630=180, which is 6 shirts. So that's acceptable.\n\nWait, but what if T=12? 12*70=840, which is more than 810. So that's not possible.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9. So the ratio is 9 trousers to 6 shirts, which is 3:2. But the question is only about the number of trousers in the ratio, or the ratio of the count of trousers to shirts.\n\nWait, the question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So it's T:S. So 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options are just numbers, like 9,8, etc., so perhaps the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure.

So no.\n\nSo the maximum number of T is 9.
