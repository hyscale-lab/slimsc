      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I've got this problem here about a worker's wages over a fortnight, which is 15 days. The question is asking for his wage on the 8th day. Hmm, I'll need to break this down step by step.\n\nSo, the average wage for all 15 days is $90 per day. That means the total wages over the fortnight would be 15 multiplied by 90. Let me calculate that: 15 * 90 is 1350. So the total is $1350.\n\nNow, the problem says that during the first 7 days, his average was $87 per day. So for those 7 days, the total would be 7 * 87. Let me compute that: 7*80 is 560, and 7*7 is 49, so total is 609. So first 7 days total $609.\n\nSimilarly, the last 7 days have an average of $92 per day. So 7 * 92. Let me do that: 7*90 is 630, and 7*2 is 14, so 630+14 is 644. So last 7 days total $644.\n\nWait, but the fortnight is 15 days, right? So the first 7, then the 8th day, and then the last 7. Oh wait, no, because 7 +1 +7 is 15. So the 8th day is the middle day.\n\nSo the total of the first 7 days is 609, the total of the last 7 days is 644. So if I add those together, what do I get? 609 + 644 = 1253.\n\nBut the total for all 15 days is 1350. So the 8th day's wage must make up the difference between 1253 and 1350.\n\nSo subtract 1253 from 1350: 1350 - 1253. Let me calculate that. 1253 + 97 is 1350, right? Because 1253 + 90 is 1343, plus 7 is 1350. So 97.\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right. Because 1253 plus 97 is 1350. So the 8th day's wage is $97.\n\nLooking at the options, D is $97. So the answer should be D.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a worker's wages over a fortnight. Hmm, a fortnight is 14 days, but the problem says it's 15 consecutive working days. Oh wait, maybe that's just the duration, so 15 days total. The average wage per day is $90. So first, I think I should calculate the total wages for the entire period.\n\nSo total average is $90 for 15 days. That would be 15 multiplied by 90. Let me calculate that: 15*90 is 1350. So the total wages for all 15 days add up to $1350.\n\nNow, the problem says that during the first 7 days, the average was $87 per day. So for those 7 days, the total is 7*87. Let me compute that: 7 times 80 is 560, 7 times 7 is 49, so 560+49=609. So first 7 days total $609.\n\nThen, the average during the last 7 days was $92. So those 7 days would be 7*92. 7*90 is 630, plus 7*2=14, so 630+14=644. So last 7 days total $644.\n\nWait, but the fortnight is 15 days, so the first 7, the last 7, and one day in between, which is the 8th day. Oh right, because 7 + 1 +7 =15 days. So the 8th day is the middle day.\n\nSo the total of the first 7 is $609, the total of the last 7 is $644, and the 8th day is what we're looking for. So adding all together: 609 (first 7) + x (8th day) + 644 (last 7) = total of 15 days, which is 1350.\n\nSo putting it together: 609 + x + 644 = 1350.\n\nLet me add 609 and 644 first. 600+600=1200, 9+44=53. So 1200+53=1253. So 1253 + x = 1350.\n\nSo x = 1350 - 1253. Let's subtract. 1350 - 1253. Hmm, 1253 plus 97 is 1350 because 1253 + 97 = 1350. So x is 97.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. 1253 +97 = 1350. So yes, that's correct. So the wage on the 8th day is $97.\n\nLooking at the options, D is $97. So the answer should be D.\n",
