      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two cars and their speeds. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that car X covers 320 km in 8 hours, and car Y covers 415 km in 5 hours. I need to find the difference in their speeds. The options are given from A to E, and I have to pick the correct one.\n\nWait, I remember that speed is calculated by dividing distance by time. So for each car, I should compute their speeds separately and then find the difference.\n\nStarting with car X. It went 320 km in 8 hours. So speed of X is 320 divided by 8. Let me calculate that. 320 divided by 8 is 40. So X's speed is 40 km/h.\n\nNow car Y. It covered 415 km in 5 hours. So Y's speed is 415 divided by 5. Let me do that math. 415 divided by 5. Well, 5 times 80 is 400, and 415 minus 400 is 15. 15 divided by 5 is 3. So 80 plus 3 is 83. So Y's speed is 83 km/h.\n\nNow I need the difference between the two speeds. So subtract X's speed from Y's. 83 minus 40 equals 43. So the difference is 43 km/h.\n\nLooking back at the options: A)42, B)41, C)43, D)45, E)None. So the correct answer should be option C.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. For X: 320/8 is definitely 40. Y: 415/5, 5*83 is 415? Let me see. 5 times 80 is 400, 5 times 3 is 15, so yes, 415. So 83-40 is 43. Yep, that's right. So the answer is C.\n",

Speed is basically distance divided by time, right? So I'll calculate each car's speed and then subtract them to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with Car X. The distance is 320 km, and the time is 8 hours. So speed equals distance over time. So 320 divided by 8. Let me do that math. 8 times 40 is 320, right? So 320/8 is 40. So Car X's speed is 40 km/h. Got that.\n\nNow for Car Y. It goes 415 km in 5 hours. So again, speed is distance divided by time. 415 divided by 5. Let's see, 5 times 80 is 400, so 415 minus 400 is 15. 15 divided by 5 is 3.

Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, I need the difference in their speeds. So I subtract the two speeds. Which one is faster? Car Y is at 83, Car X is 40. So 83 minus 40 is... let's see, 43. Oh wait, 83 minus 40 is 43. So the difference is 43 km/h. Let me look at the options.\n\nThe options are A)42, B)41, C)43, D)45, E)None. So option C is 43, which matches my calculation.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the cars. Did I subtract correctly? Car Y is faster. So Y's speed minus X's speed. 83-40=43.
