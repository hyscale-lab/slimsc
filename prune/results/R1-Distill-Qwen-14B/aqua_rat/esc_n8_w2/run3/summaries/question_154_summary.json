      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about two ants and their shadows. Hmm, I need to find out how long the shadow of the taller ant is. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, so the problem says there are two ants standing side by side. One ant is 4 inches tall and casts a shadow that's 10 inches long. The other ant is 6 inches tall, and I need to find its shadow length. Wait, wait, but wait\u2014are they under the same lighting conditions? I think so, because they're standing side by side, so the sun's position should be the same for both. That means the ratio of their heights to their shadow lengths should be the same.\n\nSo this sounds like a proportion problem. Proportions are when two ratios are equal. So, the height of the first ant to its shadow length should be the same as the height of the second ant to its shadow length. Let me write that down.\n\nLet me denote the unknown shadow length as S. So for the first ant, height is 4 inches, shadow is 10 inches. The ratio is 4:10. For the second ant, height is 6 inches, shadow is S inches. So ratio is 6:S.\n\nSince these ratios are equal, I can set up the proportion:\n\n4 / 10 = 6 / S\n\nWait, or is it the other way around? Oh, wait, no, the ratio of height to shadow length should be the same. So 4/10 = 6/S. Yeah, that makes sense. Alternatively, I could write it as (4 inches height)/(10 inches shadow) = (6 inches height)/(S inches shadow).\n\nSo to solve for S, I can cross-multiply. That would give 4 * S = 10 * 6. Let me compute that. 10 times 6 is 60. So 4S = 60. Then, divide both sides by 4. S = 60 /4. Hmm, 60 divided by 4 is 15. Oh, wait, so S is 15 inches? But wait, that seems a bit small. Let me double-check my steps.\n\nWait, the first ant is shorter (4 inches) and has a longer shadow (10 inches). The second ant is taller (6 inches), so its shadow should be longer than 10 inches. Because if you're taller, your shadow would be longer if the sun's angle is the same. Oh wait, but wait, in this calculation, I got 15 inches, which is longer than 10. Oh, that's correct. So 15 is longer than 10, which makes sense. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, I see option D is 15. But wait, another thought: maybe I set up the ratio incorrectly. Because sometimes, in shadow problems, the ratio could be height to shadow length, or maybe shadow length to height. Let me think: if the sun's angle is the same, then the ratio of the height to the shadow length should be the same for both ants. So for the first ant, 4 inches tall, 10 inches shadow: 4/10 = 0.4. So the second ant is 6 inches, so 6 inches divided by the shadow length S should also be 0.4. So 6/S = 0.4. Solving for S: S = 6 / 0.4 = 15. Yep, same answer. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the triangles formed by the ants and their shadows. Since the ants are standing perpendicular to the ground and the light is coming from the same direction, the triangles would be similar. So the ratio of the ant's height to the shadow length would be the same for both.\n\nWait another thought: sometimes, in proportion problems, you can also set up the proportion as height1 / shadow1 = height2 / shadow2. Which is what I did earlier. So 4/10 = 6/S. Cross-multiplying gives 4S =60, S=15. So D is 15, which would be the answer.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again: the options are A)36, B)28, C)42, D)15, E)20. So 15 is option D. So that's the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, another way to think: maybe the first ant's shadow is longer, so the sun is low, so the second ant's shadow would be longer than 10 inches. 15 is longer than 10, so that makes sense. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the steps. So the shadow length should be 15 inches. So the answer is D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we recognize that the two ants are under the same lighting conditions, meaning the ratio of their heights to their shadow lengths is constant.
