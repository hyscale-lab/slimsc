      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about two machines making yo-yos. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is asking after how many minutes both machines will have produced 10 yo-yos each, I think. Wait, no, wait. Let me read it again. Oh right, the question says, \"After how many minutes will they have produced 10 yo-yos?\" Wait, does that mean each machine makes 10, or together they make 10? Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Wait, the way it's phrased, \"they\" refers to both machines, so maybe it's the total of 10. Or perhaps each machine makes 10, but that seems like it would take longer. Let me think. Oh, but looking at the options, the numbers are in the tens and maybe higher, so perhaps it's each machine making 10.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should reevaluate. The way the question is written, \"After how many minutes will they have produced 10 yo-yos?\" So 'they' are both machines, so perhaps together they have made 10 yo-yos in total. Hmm, but that would be a very small number, like 30 minutes or something. But looking at the options, the smallest is 24, which is higher. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps each machine is producing 10 yo-yos. Because otherwise, if they're together making 10, that's a much lower number. So maybe the question is, after how many minutes will each machine have produced 10 yo-yos? That makes more sense with the options given.\n\nSo Machine A makes a yo-yo every 6 minutes. So to make 10, how long does that take? Let's calculate. If it's every 6 minutes, then for 10, that would be 10 * 6 = 60 minutes. But wait, but machine B is every 9 minutes, so 10 *9=90 minutes. But that would mean the time when both have made 10 would be when both have finished their 10th, which would be 90 minutes, but that's not one of the options. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about when they've produced the same number of yo-yos. No, the question says \"they have produced 10 yo-yos.\" Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"Machine A puts out a yo-yo every 6 minutes. Machine B puts out a yo-yo every 9 minutes. After how many minutes will they have produced 10 yo-yos?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the question is, after how many minutes will each machine have produced 10 yo-yos? Because that's the only way to get a time where both have made 10. So for A: 10 yo-yos at 6 min each is 60 min. For B: 10 at 9 min each is 90 min. So the time when both have produced 10 would be the least common multiple (LCM) of 60 and 90. Let me calculate that.\n\nWait, wait, but perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the question is just asking for when they've each made 10, and the answer is when both have done it. But 60 and 90 are the times each takes. So the time when both have finished would be the maximum of 60 and 90, which is 90 minutes. But that's not an option. So perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe the question is asking when both together have produced 10 yo-yos. So in total, 10. So how long until they've made 10 together. That would be a different calculation. Let's think about that.\n\nSo machine A makes one every 6 minutes, so rate is 1/6 per minute. Machine B is 1/9 per minute. Together, their combined rate is 1/6 + 1/9 = (3 + 2)/18 = 5/18 per minute. So to make 10 yo-yos, time would be 10 / (5/18) = 10 * (18/5) = 36 minutes. So that's 36 minutes. Looking at the options, option C is 36 minutes.\n\nWait, but that's an option, so maybe that's the correct approach. But let me think again. The wording says \"they have produced 10 yo-yos.\" The way it's phrased, it's ambiguous whether it's each or together. If it's together, then 36 minutes is correct. If it's each, then perhaps 90 is the answer, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended meaning is together, so the correct answer is C)36.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as when each has made 10, but that's when both have made 10, so the time is when both have finished their 10th. So for A, 10th is at 60 minutes. For B, 10th is at 90. So the time when both have done it is at 90 minutes, but that's not an option. So that can't be right. So perhaps the question is about when together they have made 10.\n\nSo the correct approach is calculating the combined rate. So 36 minutes is the answer, option C.\n",
