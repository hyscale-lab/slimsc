      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a shop assistant's salary. Let me read it again carefully. The question says that her monthly salary S is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. I need to find out what the monthly sales should be so that her salary reaches $1500. Hmm, okay.\n\nWait, so the total salary is fixed plus a percentage of sales. So the formula would be S = 500 + 0.05 * sales. Right, because 5% is 0.05. And I need to find the sales amount when S is 1500.\n\nLet me write that down. So 1500 equals 500 plus 0.05 times the sales. Let's denote sales as x. So 1500 = 500 + 0.05x.\n\nI need to solve for x. So first, subtract 500 from both sides. 1500 minus 500 is 1000. So 1000 = 0.05x.\n\nNow, to find x, I'll divide both sides by 0.05. So x = 1000 / 0.05. Let me calculate that. 0.05 is the same as 5 cents. So how many 5 cents are in 1000 dollars? Well, 1000 divided by 0.05 is the same as 1000 multiplied by 20, because 1/0.05 is 20. So 1000 *20 = 20,000. So x is 20,000.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Because 0.05 times 20,000 would be 1000. Adding the fixed 500, that gives 1500. Yeah, that makes sense. So the monthly sales should be $20,000.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is $20,000. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me redo the math. 5% of 20,000 is 0.05 * 20,000 = 1000. Then 500 + 1000 is 1500, which matches the target salary. So yes, that's correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So the correct option is D.\n",
