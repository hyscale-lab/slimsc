      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. \n\nAlright, the question says that professors borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest. After 3 years, the university got Rs. 300 on interest. I need to find the rate of interest per annum. The options are A)2%, B)8%, C)5%, D)10%, E)None of these.\n\nWait, simple interest, right. I remember the formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T. Where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest per annum, and T is the time in years. So in this case, I is 300, P is 5000, T is 3 years.\n\nSo plugging the numbers into the formula: 300 = 5000 * R * 3. Let me write that out. \n\nWait, so 300 equals 5000 times R times 3. Let me rearrange that to solve for R. So R would be 300 divided by (5000 *3). Let me compute that denominator first. 5000 multiplied by 3 is 15000. So R equals 300 divided by 15000.\n\nHmm, 300 divided by 15000. Let me think, 15000 divided by 300 is 50. So 300 divided by 15000 is 1/50, which is 0.02. So R is 0.02, which is 2%. \n\nWait, so that would be option A)2%. But wait a second, that seems low. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nI is 300, P is 5000, T is 3. So I = P*R*T => R = I/(P*T). So R = 300/(5000*3) = 300 / 15000 = 0.02. Yeah, that's 2%. So the rate is 2% per annum. So the correct answer should be A)2%. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The principal is 5000, time is 3 years, interest is 300. So 5000 * R *3 =300. So R =300/(5000*3)= 300/15000= 0.02. So 2% is correct. So option A.\n",
