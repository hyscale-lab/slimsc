      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: A cyclist is traveling at 12 miles per hour. I need to find out how many minutes it will take to travel 48 miles. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that speed is distance divided by time. The formula is speed = distance/time. So if I rearrange that, time equals distance divided by speed. Right, so time = distance / speed.\n\nIn this case, the distance is 48 miles, and the speed is 12 mph. So plugging those numbers in, time = 48 miles / 12 mph. Let me do that division. 48 divided by 12 is 4. So the time is 4 hours.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the time in minutes, not hours. Oh right, because the options are in minutes. So I need to convert hours to minutes. I know that 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 4 hours would be 4 times 60.\n\nLet me calculate that: 4 * 60 is 240 minutes. So the time taken is 240 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 240. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, did I miss anything? Let me double-check. The speed is 12 mph, so in one hour, the cyclist goes 12 miles. For 48 miles, how many times does 12 go into 48? 4 times. So 4 hours. 4 hours is 240 minutes. Yep, that seems right.\n",
