      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Ram and Krishna starting from points A and B respectively, moving towards each other. Hmm. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nSo, Ram is starting from A, and he's moving at 20 meters per second. Krishna starts from B at the same time and moves towards A at 40 meters per second. They meet at point C after 10 seconds. The question is asking for the total distance between A and B.\n\nWait, right. So, when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Because they're moving towards each other, their speeds add up. So, the combined speed would be 20 + 40 = 60 m/s.\n\nOh, wait, that makes sense. Because if Ram is moving at 20 and Krishna at 40, in one second, together they cover 60 meters. So in 10 seconds, they would have covered 60 * 10 = 600 meters. But wait, that's the distance they cover until they meet, right? So the total distance between A and B should be the same as the distance they've covered together when they meet. Because they started at opposite ends and met somewhere in between.\n\nSo the distance between A and B is the sum of the distances each traveled until they met. Let me think. Alternatively, since they started at the same time and met after 10 seconds, I can calculate how much each traveled in those 10 seconds and add them together.\n\nRam's speed is 20 m/s. In 10 seconds, he would have gone 20 * 10 = 200 meters. Krishna's speed is 40 m/s, so he would have gone 40 * 10 = 400 meters. Adding those together, 200 + 400 = 600 meters. So the total distance between A and B is 600 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 600 meters. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Did I add their speeds correctly? Yes, 20 plus 40 is 60 m/s. Multiply by time, 10 seconds, gives 600 meters. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it: the time until they meet is the same for both. So, the distance each covers is speed multiplied by time. Adding those gives the total distance between A and B.\n\nYes, so I'm confident the answer is E) 600 meters.\n",

Their speeds are given as 20 m/s and 40 m/s. They meet after 10 seconds, and I need to find the total distance between A and B. Hmm, I think I can solve this by calculating the distance each covers until they meet and then adding those distances together.\n\nWait, so when they start moving towards each other, their speeds add up in terms of closing the distance between A and B. Oh right, because they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So that would be 20 m/s + 40 m/s = 60 m/s. \n\nBut wait, another approach is to calculate how far each has traveled in those 10 seconds and then add them. Because the time taken until they meet is the same for both, right? So for Ram, moving at 20 m/s for 10 seconds would be 20 * 10 = 200 meters.

Sometimes in these problems, the distance between A and B is the same as the combined distance each has traveled before meeting. So yeah, that's correct. Because when they meet at point C, the total distance covered by both equals the initial distance between A and B. So 200 +400 =600 meters is the total distance. \n\nI don't think I made a mistake here. The options don't have 600 in all except E, so I'm confident. So the answer is E.\n",
