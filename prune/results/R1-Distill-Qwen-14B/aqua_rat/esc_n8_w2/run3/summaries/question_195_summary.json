      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about three bells ringing at different intervals, and I need to find out when they'll all ring together again. Hmm, I remember that when things happen at regular intervals, the time they all coincide is related to the least common multiple, or LCM, of their intervals. Right, so the LCM will give me the next time they all ring together after starting at the same time.\n\nThe intervals given are 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds. So I need to find the LCM of these three numbers. Let me think about how to compute that. I remember that LCM can be found by breaking each number down into its prime factors and then taking the highest power of each prime that appears.\n\nLet me start by factorizing each number:\n\n36 seconds: Let's see, 36 divided by 2 is 18, then 9. 9 is 3 squared. So 36 is 2^2 * 3^2.\n\n40 seconds: 40 divided by 2 is 20, divided by 2 again is 10, then 5. So 40 is 2^3 * 5^1.\n\n48 seconds: 48 divided by 2 is 24, again by 2 is 12, again by 2 is 6, and again by 2 is 3. So 48 is 2^4 * 3^1.\n\nNow, for the LCM, I take the highest exponent of each prime present in these factorizations. The primes here are 2, 3, and 5.\n\n- For 2: the highest exponent is 4 (from 48's 2^4).\n- For 3: the highest exponent is 2 (from 36's 3^2).\n- For 5: the highest exponent is 1 (from 40's 5^1).\n\nSo the LCM is 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^1. Let me calculate that.\n\n2^4 is 16. 3^2 is 9. 16 multiplied by 9 is 144. Then, 144 multiplied by 5 is 720. So the LCM is 720 seconds.\n\nWait, I need to convert this into minutes because the options are in minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 720 divided by 60 is 12. So that's 12 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is after 12 minutes. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Let me think if there's any possibility I made a mistake in the factorization or the LCM calculation.\n\n36: 2*2*3*3. Correct.\n40: 2*2*2*5. Correct.\n48: 2*2*2*2*3. Correct.\n\nSo the exponents are correct. So LCM is indeed 2^4 (16) *3^2 (9) *5 (5). 16*9 is 144, 144*5 is 720. 720 seconds is 12 minutes. So yeah, option B.\n",
