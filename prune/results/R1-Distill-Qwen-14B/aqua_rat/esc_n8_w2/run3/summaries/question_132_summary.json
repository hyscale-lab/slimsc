      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out this math problem. Hmm, the question is [(272 - 32) (124 + 176)] divided by (17 x 15 - 15). I need to find the value of this expression and choose the correct option from A to E.\n\nAlright, let's break it down step by step. First, I'll handle the operations inside the brackets and parentheses.\n\nStarting with the numerator: (272 - 32) multiplied by (124 + 176). Let's calculate each part separately.\n\n272 minus 32: Let me subtract. 272 minus 30 is 242, minus another 2 is 240. So that's 240.\n\nNow the other part: 124 plus 176. Hmm, adding those. 124 + 176. Let me think, 124 + 176 is like 124 + 170 is 294, plus 6 is 300. Wait, no, wait, 176 is 170 +6, so 124 +170 is 294, plus 6 is 300. Oh right, that's 300.\n\nSo the numerator is 240 multiplied by 300. Let me compute that. 240 times 300. Hmm, 240 * 3 is 720, so 240 * 300 is 72,000. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 240 * 300 is 240 * 3 * 100, which is 720 * 100 = 72,000. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow the denominator is (17 x 15) minus 15. Let me compute that. 17 multiplied by 15. Hmm, 15 times 17. Let me calculate: 10*15=150, 7*15=105. Wait, no, wait, 17 is 10 +7. So 15 * 10 is 150, 15 *7 is 105. Adding them together gives 150+105=255. So 17 x 15 is 255. Then subtract 15: 255 -15 is 240.\n\nSo now the denominator is 240.\n\nSo putting it all together, the expression is 72,000 divided by 240. Let me compute that.\n\nDividing 72,000 by 240. Hmm. Let me simplify this division. Maybe I can simplify the numbers by dividing numerator and denominator by 10, which gives 7,200 / 24. That's easier.\n\n7,200 divided by 24. Let me think, 24 times 300 is 7,200, because 24*300=7,200. So that's 300.\n\nWait, so the result is 300. Now I look at the options. Option C is 300, so that's probably the answer. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me recalculate the numerator:\n\n272 -32 is indeed 240. 124 +176: 124 +176 is 300. 240 *300 is 72,000. Correct.\n\nDenominator: 17*15 is 255, 255-15 is 240. Correct.\n\n72,000 /240: 72,000 divided by 240. Let me compute it another way. 240 times 300 is 72,000. So yes, 300 is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be option C, 300.\n",

And then I have to choose the correct option from A to E.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the problem to visualize it better. So, the numerator is (272 - 32) multiplied by (124 + 176), and the denominator is (17\u00d715 - 15). I think I should compute each part separately and then combine them.\n\nStarting with the numerator: I'll handle the two parts inside the brackets first. Let's do 272 minus 32. Hmm, 272 - 30 is 242, and then minus 2 more is 240. So that part is 240.\n\nNext, the other part of the numerator: 124 plus 176. Let me add those. 124 + 176... Well, 120 + 170 is 290, and 4 +6 is 10, so 290+10=300. So that part is 300.\n\nNow, the numerator is 240 multiplied by 300. Wait, what's 240\u00d7300? Let me think. 240 times 3 is 720, so 240 times 300 would be 72,000. Right? Because 300 is 3\u00d7100, so 720\u00d7100 is 72,000.\n\nNow the denominator: 17 multiplied by 15 minus 15. Let me calculate 17\u00d715 first. Hmm, 15 times 10 is 150, and 15 times 7 is 105. So 150 + 105 is 255. So 17\u00d715 is 255. Then subtract 15 from that. 255 -15 is 240.

So 72,000 /240 = 72,000 \u00f7 (240). Let me compute 72,000 \u00f7240.\n\nAlternatively, 72,000 \u00f7240 can be thought of as 72,000 \u00f7 (24 \u00d710) )= (72,000 \u00f724) \u00f710.\n\n72,000 \u00f724: 24 \u00d73000 is 72,000 (because 24\u00d7300=7200, so 24\u00d73000=72,000).

Correct. 124 +176: 124+176 is 300. Correct. So 240\u00d7300 is 72,000. Yes. Denominator: 17\u00d715 is 255. 255-15 is 240. So 72,000 \u00f7240.
