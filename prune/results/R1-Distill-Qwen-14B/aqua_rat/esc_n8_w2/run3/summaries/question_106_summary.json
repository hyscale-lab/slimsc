      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out how much money John has. Let's read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nMark tells John, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" Then John responds, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" Hmm, so we have two scenarios here, each involving giving some portion of their money and resulting in a certain amount.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to set up some equations. Let's denote the amount of money Mark has as M and John has as J.\n\nFirst scenario: John gives half his money to Mark. So John gives away J/2. After that, John would have J - (J/2) = J/2 left. Mark, on the other hand, would have M + (J/2). According to Mark's statement, this amount equals Rs.75. So the first equation is:\n\nM + (J/2) = 75.\n\nSecond scenario: Mark gives one third of his money to John. So Mark gives M/3 to John. Now, after this exchange, Mark has M - (M/3) = (2M/3) left. John, who initially had J, now has J + (M/3). According to John's statement, this equals 75. So the second equation is:\n\nJ + (M/3) = 75.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n\n1) M + (J/2) = 75\n2) J + (M/3) = 75\n\nI need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find J, which is what the question is asking for.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEquation 1: M + (J/2) = 75\nEquation 2: J + (M/3) = 75\n\nHmm, maybe I can express M from one equation and substitute into the other. Let's solve equation 1 for M.\n\nFrom equation 1: M = 75 - (J/2)\n\nNow plug this expression for M into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2 becomes: J + [(75 - (J/2))/3] = 75.\n\nLet me compute this step by step. Let's compute the term (75 - J/2)/3 first.\n\nSo, J + [ (75 - (J/2) ) /3 ] =75.\n\nLet me combine the terms. Maybe I can multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator.\n\nMultiplying each term by 3:\n\n3*J + (75 - (J/2)) = 3*75.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n3J +75 - (J/2) =225.\n\nCombine like terms. Let's get all the J terms together.\n\n3J - (J/2) = 3J - 0.5J = 2.5J.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n2.5J +75 =225.\n\nSubtract 75 from both sides:\n\n2.5J = 225 -75 =150.\n\nNow, J =150 /2.5.\n\nWhat's 150 divided by 2.5? Let me calculate that. 2.5 *60=150. Because 2.5 * 60 = 150. So J=60.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So John has Rs.60. Let me check the options. Option B is 60. So that's probably the answer. But wait, let me verify the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me plug J=60 back into equation 1 to find M.\n\nEquation 1: M + (60/2) =75 \u2192 M +30=75 \u2192 M=45.\n\nSo Mark has Rs.45.\n\nNow let's check the second scenario. Mark gives 1/3 of his money, which is 45/3=15, to John. So John would have 60 +15=75. That's correct according to the problem statement.\n\nAlso, in the first scenario, John gives half his money (30) to Mark. So Mark would have 45+30=75. Correct.\n\nSo everything checks out. John has 60, which is option B.\n",

Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem goes like this: Mark tells John, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" Then John responds, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" I need to find out how much money John has.\n\nHmm, okay, so it's a two-part problem where both Mark and John are making statements about exchanging money and ending up with Rs.75. I think I need to set up some equations based on their statements.\n\nLet me denote the variables. Let's say John has J rupees, and Mark has M rupees.\n\nFirst, let's look at Mark's statement. He says if John gives him half of John's money, Mark will have Rs.75. So, if John gives half his money to Mark, Mark's new amount becomes his original amount plus half of John's. And John's new amount becomes his original amount minus half of his money, which is half of J.\n\nWait, but in Mark's statement, he's saying that after this exchange, he (Mark) will have Rs.75. So the equation would be:\n\nM + (J/2) = 75.\n\nThat's equation one.\n\nNow, John's statement. He says, if Mark gives him one third of Mark's money, John will have Rs.75. So in this scenario, Mark gives John a third of his (Mark's) money. So John's new amount is his original J plus (M/3). Mark's new amount is M minus (M/3) which is (2M/3).\n\nBut according to John's statement, after this exchange, he (John) will have Rs.75. So the equation is:\n\nJ + (M/3) = 75.\n\nThat's equation two.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) M + (J/2) = 75\n2) J + (M/3) = 75\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find J (John's money).\n\nLet me write them again for clarity.\n\nEquation 1: M + (J/2) = 75\nEquation 2: J + (M/3) = 75\n\nHmm, I can solve these using substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination would be easier here. Let me try to rearrange the equations to express M and J in terms that can be substituted.\n\nFrom equation 1: Let's solve for M.\n\nM = 75 - (J/2)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for M into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2 becomes: J + [(75 - (J/2))/3] = 75\n\nLet me simplify this step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the substitution:\n\nJ + (75/3) - (J/2)/3 = 75\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n75/3 is 25. So that becomes:\n\nJ + 25 - (J/6) =75\n\nWait, because (J/2)/3 is (J)/(6). So, the equation now is:\n\nJ - (J/6) + 25 = 75\n\nCombine like terms. J - J/6 is the same as (6J/6 - J/6) = (5J/6).\n\nSo, 5J/6 +25 =75\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides:\n\n5J/6 = 50\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\n5J = 300\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nJ =60.\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options. Option B is 60. So John has 60 rupees.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me plug J=60 back into equation 1 to find M.\n\nEquation 1: M + (60/2) =75 \u2192 M +30=75 \u2192 M=45.\n\nSo Mark has 45 rupees.\n\nNow, let's check John's statement with these values.\n\nJohn says if Mark gives him a third of Mark's money, he'll have 75.\n\nMark's money is 45, so a third is 15. So John's new amount is 60 +15=75. That checks out.\n\nAnd Mark's new amount would be 45 -15=30.\n\nWait, but Mark's statement was that if John gives him half of John's money, Mark will have 75.\n\nJohn has 60, so half is 30. So Mark's new amount is 45 +30=75. That also checks out.\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied with J=60 and M=45. So the answer should be 60, which is option B.\n",
