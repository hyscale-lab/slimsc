      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem about the average number of microwave ovens sold over 22 months. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwaves per month. Wait, but wait, how many months are in a year? Oh right, 12 months. So last year's total sales would be 42 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that. 42 times 12... 42*10 is 420, and 42*2 is 84, so 420+84 is 504. So last year, they sold 504 microwaves.\n\nNow, this year, in the first 10 months, they've sold an average of 20 per month. So the total for those 10 months is 20 times 10, which is 200. \n\nSo, the total sales over the entire 22 months would be last year's total plus this year's first 10 months. That's 504 plus 200, which equals 704. \n\nWait, wait, wait. Oh, wait a second, I think I might have messed that up. Because the 22 months period includes last year's 12 months and this year's 10 months. So yes, 504 plus 200 is 704 total microwaves sold.\n\nNow, to find the average per month over the 22 months, I need to divide the total by 22. So 704 divided by 22. Let's compute that. Hmm, 22 times 31 is 682, because 22*30 is 660, plus 22 is 682. Then, 22*32 is 704, because 682 +22 is 704. Oh wait, so 22 multiplied by 32 equals 704. So 704 divided by 22 is 32. \n\nWait, that can't be right because 32 times 22 is 704, so the average would be 32. But wait, the options given are A)21, B)30, C)31, D)32, E)None. So D is 32, which would be the answer. \n\nWait, but wait another moment. Did I calculate the totals correctly? Let me double-check. Last year: 12 months at 42 each: 12 *42=504. Correct. This year's first 10 months: 10*20=200. So total is 504+200=704. Then, 704 /22=32. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo the average is 32. Looking at the options, D is 32, so the answer should be D.\n",

Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.\n\nThe problem says that last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month. Then, in the first 10 months of this year, they sold an average of 20 per month. The question is asking for the average number of microwaves sold per month over the entire 22-month period. The options are A to E, with E being none of the above.\n\nHmm, so I think I need to calculate the total number of microwaves sold in each period and then find the overall average.\n\nWait, let's break it down. Last year, which is 12 months, right? Because a year has 12 months. So if they sold an average of 42 per month, the total for last year would be 42 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that. 42 times 12. Let me think, 40 times 12 is 480, and 2 times 12 is 24. So 480 plus 24 is 504. So last year's total is 504 microwaves.\n\nThen this year, the first 10 months have an average of 20 per month. So the total for this period is 20 multiplied by 10, which is 200.\n\nWait, but the total time we're considering is 22 months. Oh, right! Because last year was 12 months, and this year's first 10 months make it 22 in total. So the combined total sales would be 504 plus 200. Let's add those together: 504 plus 200 is 704. So the total number of microwaves sold over 22 months is 704.\n\nNow, to find the average per month, I divide the total by the number of months. So 704 divided by 22. Let me compute that. Hmm, 22 times 30 is 660. 704 minus 660 is 44. So 22 goes into 44 twice (22*2=44). So 30 plus 2 is 32. So the average is 32 per month.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 32. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I get the months right? Last year is 12 months, and this year's first 10 make it 22? Yes, 12 plus 10 is 22. So the periods are correct.\n\nYes, the calculations seem right. 504 plus 200 is 704. Divided by 22 is 32. So the correct answer is D.\n",
