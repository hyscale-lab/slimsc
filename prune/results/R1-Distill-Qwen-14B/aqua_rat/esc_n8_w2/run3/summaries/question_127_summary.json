      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about alloys made of zinc and copper. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, there are two alloys, X and Y. Alloy X is made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9. Alloy Y is mixed in 7:11. Then, they take 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y, melt them, and mix them to form alloy Z. I need to find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z.\n\nWait, ratios can sometimes be tricky. Let me think. Each alloy has its own composition, so I should find out how much zinc and copper are in each part when they're melted and then combine them.\n\nStarting with alloy X: the ratio is 6:9. That simplifies to 2:3, right? Because 6 and 9 are both divisible by 3. So, for every 2 parts of zinc, there are 3 parts copper. But wait, what's the total parts? 2+3=5 parts. So each part is equal to the mass of the alloy divided by 5. Oh wait, no. Because alloy X is 40 grams. Or wait, no, the ratios are given as parts per alloy. So for each alloy, I need to calculate the mass of zinc and copper in those 40 grams and 60 grams respectively.\n\nWait, no, wait. The ratio is per alloy. So for alloy X, the ratio is 6:9, which is 2:3. So the total parts are 2+3=5 parts. So each part is 40g divided by 5, which is 8g. So zinc in X is 6 parts *8g=48g. Copper is 3*8=24g. Wait, wait, no. Wait, no. Because the ratio is 6:9, which is parts of zinc to copper. So for every 6 parts zinc, 9 parts copper. So 6+9=15 parts total. Oh! Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because 6:9 is the same as 2:3, but perhaps I should keep it as 6:9 to make the calculation easier.\n\nSo for alloy X, 6:9 ratio. So total parts =15. So each part is 40g /15. So zinc in X is 6*(40/15) = 6*(8/3) = 16 grams. Wait, 40 divided by 15 is 8/3? Let me double-check: 15*(8/3) is 40, yes. So 6*(8/3) is 16 grams of zinc. Similarly, copper in X is 9*(8/3)=24 grams.\n\nWait, that seems right. So X contributes 16g zinc and 24g copper.\n\nNow, alloy Y has a ratio of 7:11 for zinc to copper. So total parts 7+11=18. The alloy Y is 60 grams. So each part is 60/18 = 10/3 grams per part. So zinc in Y is 7*(10/3) = 70/3 \u224823.333 grams. Copper is 11*(10/3)=110/3 \u224836.666 grams.\n\nWait, but I should keep these as fractions to be precise. So zinc from Y is 70/3 grams, copper is 110/3 grams.\n\nNow, adding the zinc from X and Y. Zinc total is 16 + (70/3). Let me compute that. 16 is 48/3, so 48/3 +70/3 = 118/3 grams zinc.\n\nCopper total is 24 + (110/3). 24 is 72/3, so 72/3 +110/3= 182/3 grams copper.\n\nSo the ratio of zinc to copper in Z is (118/3) : (182/3). The denominators are the same, so they cancel out. So it's 118:182.\n\nHmm, can this be simplified? Let's see. Both numbers are even, so divide by 2: 59:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91. Looking at the options, option D is 59:91, and option B is 59:91 as well? Wait, wait. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nWait, options B and D are the same. That's a bit odd. Maybe a typo in the options, but assuming that D is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be option D)59:91.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about alloys made of zinc and copper. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says X and Y are two alloys. X is made by mixing zinc and copper in a ratio of 6:9. Y is made in the ratio 7:11. Then, 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z. I need to find the ratio of zinc to copper in Z.\n\nWait, ratios can sometimes be tricky. Let me think. So, for alloy X, the ratio is 6:9. I think that's zinc to copper. So, for every 6 parts of zinc, there are 9 parts of copper. Similarly, Y is 7:11, so 7 parts zinc to 11 parts copper.\n\nBut wait, the total parts for X would be 6+9=15 parts. And for Y, 7+11=18 parts. So, when we take 40 grams of X, we need to find how much zinc and copper are in that. Similarly for Y, 60 grams.\n\nLet me break it down. For alloy X:\n\nTotal parts = 15. So each part is 40g divided by 15? No, wait. Wait, no. Because 40 grams is the entire alloy. So each part is 40g /15.\n\nSo zinc in X: (6/15)*40g. Let me calculate that. 6/15 is 2/5. 2/5 of 40 is (2*40)/5=80/5=16 grams of zinc. Then copper is 9/15 of 40, which is 3/5 *40=24 grams. So X contributes 16g Zn and 24g Cu.\n\nNow for alloy Y: ratio 7:11. Total parts 18. So each part is 60g /18 = 3.333... grams. Wait, 60/18 is 10/3, which is approximately 3.333 grams per part.\n\nZinc in Y: 7 parts. So 7*(10/3) = 70/3 \u224823.333 grams. Copper is 11 parts: 11*(10/3)=110/3 \u224836.666 grams. So Y contributes about 23.333g Zn and 36.666g Cu.\n\nNow, adding them together: total Zn is 16 + (70/3). Let me compute that. 16 is 48/3, so 48/3 +70/3= 118/3 grams of Zn.\n\nTotal Cu is 24 + (110/3). 24 is 72/3, so 72/3 +110/3= 182/3 grams of Cu.\n\nSo the ratio of Zn to Cu is (118/3) : (182/3). The denominators are same, so they cancel. So ratio is 118:182.\n\nWait, can I simplify this? Let's see. Both are even numbers. 118 \u00f7 2=59, 182 \u00f72=91. So the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 59:91. Option B is 59:91 as well? Wait no, checking the options again. Let me see:\n\nOptions:\nA)69:91\nB)59:91\nC)59:90\nD)59:91\nE)69:101\n\nWait, both B and D are 59:91. Oh, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, wait. Let me recheck. For alloy X, 40g. Ratio 6:9 is 2:3, so zinc is 2/5 *40=16, copper 24. Correct.\n\nAlloy Y: 60g, ratio 7:11. 7+11=18 parts. Each part is 60/18=10/3 \u22483.333. Zinc is 7*(10/3)=70/3\u224823.333. Copper 11*(10/3)=110/3\u224836.666. So Zn is 16 +70/3= (48+70)/3=118/3. Cu is 24 + 110/3= (72 +110)/3=182/3.\n\nSo ratio is (118/3)/(182/3)=118/182=59/91. So ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, both B and D are 59:91. Wait, that can't be. Oh wait, perhaps a typo in the options. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the user presented the options as:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because both B and D are the same. Hmm, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recalculate the totals.\n\nZn: 16 (from X) + (70/3) from Y.\n\nWait, 16 is 48/3, so 48/3 +70/3=118/3.\n\nCu: 24 (72/3) +110/3=182/3.\n\nSo yes, 118:182 is 59:91. So the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, both B and D are 59:91. That's a problem because in reality, each option should be unique.\n\nWait, perhaps the options were meant to have D as 59:91 and B as something else. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the ratios correctly.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z\". So that's Zn:Copper.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91, which is option B and D. But the options have B as 59:91 and D as 59:91. That can't be right. So perhaps the options are misnumbered, but I have to choose from the given.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are as follows:\n\nOption B is 59:91, and D is 59:91 as well? That's impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me check the initial ratios again. Alloy X is zinc to copper 6:9. So 6 parts Zn to 9 parts Cu. So in X, 40 grams is 15 parts. So each part is 40/15=8/3 grams. So Zn is 6*(8/3)=16 grams, Cu 9*(8/3)=24 grams. Correct.\n\nAlloy Y is 7:11. So 18 parts, 60 grams. Each part is 60/18=10/3 grams. So Zn is 7*(10/3)=70/3 \u224823.333g, Cu 11*(10/3)=110/3\u224836.666g.\n\nTotal Zn:16 +70/3 = (48 +70)/3= 118/3 \u224839.333g.\n\nTotal Cu:24 + 110/3 = (72 +110)/3=182/3 \u224860.666g.\n\nRatio Zn:Cu is (118/3) : (182/3) = 118:182.\n\nSimplify: Divide numerator and denominator by 2. 59:91.\n\nSo the correct ratio is 59:91, which is option D. Wait, but in the options given, B and D are same. Oh, perhaps a typo in the question. Let me recheck the options.\n\nWait, the user presented the options as:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nWait, so both B and D are same. That's a mistake. So perhaps the correct option is D, but perhaps the intended answer is B, but in reality, it's 59:91, so both B and D are correct. But in reality, the options should have unique answers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 40 grams of X, which is 15 parts. 40/15=8/3 per part. So Zn in X:6*(8/3)=16g.\n\nY is 60g, 18 parts. 60/18=10/3 per part. Zn:7*(10/3)=70/3\u224823.333g.\n\nTotal Zn:16 +70/3 = (48 +70)/3=118/3.\n\nTotal Cu:24 + 110/3= (72+110)/3=182/3.\n\nRatio is 118/3 : 182/3 =118:182=59:91.\n\nSo the answer should be 59:91, which is option B and D. But since both are same, perhaps the correct intended option is D, but the way the options are written, perhaps it's option D.\n\nWait, looking at the options, I think the correct answer is 59:91, which is present in both B and D. But perhaps in the original problem, only one of them is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the math. Let me see: 118 divided by 2 is 59, and 182 divided by 2 is 91. So yes, 59:91.\n\nSo the correct answer is 59:91. Looking at the options, options B and D are same. So perhaps the correct answer is B, but maybe the options are wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the total grams of Zn and Cu, then find the ratio.\n\nTotal Zn = 16 + (70/3) = (48 +70)/3 = 118/3.\n\nTotal Cu = 24 + (110/3) = (72 +110)/3 = 182/3.\n\nSo ratio is (118/3)/(182/3) =118/182=59/91.\n\nSo 59:91. So looking at the options, both B and D have this ratio. Hmm, that's confusing. But perhaps the correct answer is D, but I can't tell. Alternatively, perhaps the options are misnumbered.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are:\n\nA) 69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nWait, that can't be. So the correct answer is 59:91, which is options B and D. But that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the total Zn and Cu. Let me try a different approach.\n\nFor alloy X:\n\n40 grams in total. Ratio 6:9 \u2192 2:3.\n\nSo Zn: (2/5)*40 =16g.\n\nCu: (3/5)*40=24g.\n\nFor Y:\n\n60 grams, ratio 7:11 \u21927/(7+11)=7/18 Zn.\n\nZn: (7/18)*60= (7*60)/18=7*(10/3)=70/3 \u224823.333g.\n\nCu: (11/18)*60= (11*10/3)=110/3\u224836.666g.\n\nTotal Zn:16 +70/3 = (48 +70)/3= 118/3.\n\nTotal Cu:24 +110/3= (72 +110)/3=182/3.\n\nRatio: 118/3 : 182/3 \u2192 118:182 \u2192 59:91.\n\nSo the correct answer is 59:91. Looking at the options, both B and D are same. So perhaps the intended correct option is D, but I can't be sure. Alternatively, perhaps the options are wrong, but the correct answer is 59:91, which is options B and D.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the options again. Let me read the user's question again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nWait, so both B and D are same. That's impossible. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, but why are both B and D same? Hmm. Maybe it's a typo, and the correct option is D, perhaps the correct option is D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct and I made a mistake. Let me think again. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternative approach: Calculate the amount of Zn and Cu from each alloy and sum.\n\nAlloy X: 40g, ratio Zn:Cu=6:9=2:3.\n\nSo Zn = (2/5)*40=16g, Cu=24g.\n\nAlloy Y:60g, ratio Zn:Cu=7:11.\n\nZn= (7/18)*60=23.333g, Cu=36.666g.\n\nTotal Zn:16 +23.333=39.333g.\n\nTotal Cu:24+36.666=60.666g.\n\nRatio Zn:Cu is 39.333 :60.666.\n\nMultiply both by 3 to eliminate decimals: 118:182 \u2192 59:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91.\n\nSo looking at the options, the correct answer is either B or D, but since both are same, perhaps the intended answer is D.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about alloys made of zinc and copper. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says X and Y are two alloys. X is made by mixing zinc and copper in a ratio of 6:9. Y is made in the ratio 7:11. Then, 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z. I need to find the ratio of zinc to copper in Z.\n\nWait, ratios can sometimes be tricky. Let me think. So, for alloy X, the ratio is 6:9. I think that's zinc to copper. So, for every 6 parts of zinc, there are 9 parts of copper. Similarly, Y is 7:11, so 7 parts zinc to 11 parts copper.\n\nBut wait, the total parts for X would be 6+9=15 parts. And for Y, 7+11=18 parts. So, when we take 40 grams of X, we need to find how much zinc and copper are in that. Similarly for Y, 60 grams.\n\nLet me break it down. For alloy X:\n\nTotal parts = 15. So each part is 40g divided by 15? No, wait. Wait, no. Because 40 grams is the entire alloy. So each part is 40g /15.\n\nSo zinc in X: (6/15)*40g. Let me calculate that. 6/15 is 2/5. 2/5 of 40 is (2*40)/5=80/5=16 grams of zinc. Then copper is 9/15 of 40, which is 3/5 *40=24 grams. So X contributes 16g Zn and 24g Cu.\n\nNow for alloy Y: ratio 7:11. Total parts 18. So each part is 60g /18 = 3.333... grams. Wait, 60/18 is 10/3, which is approximately 3.333 grams per part.\n\nZinc in Y: 7 parts. So 7*(10/3) = 70/3 \u224823.333 grams. Copper is 11 parts: 11*(10/3)=110/3 \u224836.666 grams. So Y contributes about 23.333g Zn and 36.666g Cu.\n\nNow, adding them together: total Zn is 16 + (70/3). Let me compute that. 16 is 48/3, so 48/3 +70/3= 118/3 grams of Zn.\n\nTotal Cu is 24 + (110/3). 24 is 72/3, so 72/3 +110/3= 182/3 grams of Cu.\n\nSo the ratio of Zn to Cu is (118/3) : (182/3). The denominators are same, so they cancel. So ratio is 118:182.\n\nWait, can I simplify this? Let's see. Both are even numbers. 118 \u00f7 2=59, 182 \u00f72=91. So the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 59:91. Option B is 59:91 as well? Wait no, checking the options again. Let me see:\n\nOptions:\nA)69:91\nB)59:91\nC)59:90\nD)59:91\nE)69:101\n\nWait, both B and D are 59:91. Oh, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, wait. Let me recheck. For alloy X, 40g. Ratio 6:9 is 2:3, so zinc is 2/5 *40=16, copper 24. Correct.\n\nAlloy Y: 60g, ratio 7:11. 7+11=18 parts. Each part is 60/18=10/3 \u22483.333. Zinc is 7*(10/3)=70/3\u224823.333. Copper 11*(10/3)=110/3\u224836.666. So Zn is 16 +70/3= (48+70)/3=118/3. Cu is 24 + 110/3= (72 +110)/3=182/3.\n\nSo ratio is (118/3)/(182/3)=118/182=59/91. So ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, both B and D are 59:91. Wait, that can't be. Oh wait, perhaps a typo in the options. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the user presented the options as:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because both B and D are the same. Hmm, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recalculate the totals.\n\nZn: 16 (from X) + (70/3) from Y.\n\nWait, 16 is 48/3, so 48/3 +70/3=118/3.\n\nCu: 24 (72/3) +110/3=182/3.\n\nSo yes, 118:182 is 59:91. So the ratio is 59:91.\n\nLooking at the options, both B and D are 59:91. That's a problem because in reality, each option should be unique.\n\nWait, perhaps the options were meant to have D as 59:91 and B as something else. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the ratios correctly.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z\". So that's Zn:Copper.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91, which is option B and D. But the options have B as 59:91 and D as 59:91. That can't be right. So perhaps the options are misnumbered, but I have to choose from the given.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are as follows:\n\nOption B is 59:91, and D is 59:91 as well? That's impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me check the initial ratios again. Alloy X is zinc to copper 6:9. So 6 parts Zn to 9 parts Cu. So in X, 40 grams is 15 parts. So each part is 40/15=8/3 grams. So Zn is 6*(8/3)=16 grams, Cu 9*(8/3)=24 grams. Correct.\n\nAlloy Y is 7:11. So 18 parts, 60 grams. Each part is 60/18=10/3 grams. So Zn is 7*(10/3)=70/3 \u224823.333g, Cu 11*(10/3)=110/3\u224836.666g.\n\nTotal Zn:16 +70/3 = (48 +70)/3= 118/3 \u224839.333g.\n\nTotal Cu:24 + 110/3 = (72 +110)/3=182/3 \u224860.666g.\n\nRatio Zn:Cu is (118/3) : (182/3) = 118:182.\n\nSimplify: Divide numerator and denominator by 2. 59:91.\n\nSo the correct ratio is 59:91, which is option D. Wait, but in the options given, B and D are same. Oh, perhaps a typo in the question. Let me recheck the options.\n\nWait, the user presented the options as:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nWait, so both B and D are same. That's a mistake. So perhaps the correct option is D, but perhaps the intended answer is B, but in reality, it's 59:91, so both B and D are correct. But in reality, the options should have unique answers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 40 grams of X, which is 15 parts. 40/15=8/3 per part. So Zn in X:6*(8/3)=16g.\n\nY is 60g, 18 parts. 60/18=10/3 per part. Zn:7*(10/3)=70/3\u224823.333g.\n\nTotal Zn:16 +70/3 = (48 +70)/3=118/3.\n\nTotal Cu:24 + 110/3= (72+110)/3=182/3.\n\nRatio is 118/3 : 182/3 =118:182=59:91.\n\nSo the answer should be 59:91, which is option B and D. But since both are same, perhaps the correct intended option is D, but the way the options are written, perhaps it's option D.\n\nWait, looking at the options, I think the correct answer is 59:91, which is present in both B and D. But perhaps in the original problem, only one of them is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the math. Let me see: 118 divided by 2 is 59, and 182 divided by 2 is 91. So yes, 59:91.\n\nSo the correct answer is 59:91. Looking at the options, options B and D are same. So perhaps the correct answer is B, but maybe the options are wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the total grams of Zn and Cu, then find the ratio.\n\nTotal Zn = 16 + (70/3) = (48 +70)/3 = 118/3.\n\nTotal Cu = 24 + (110/3) = (72 +110)/3 = 182/3.\n\nSo ratio is (118/3)/(182/3) =118/182=59/91.\n\nSo 59:91. So looking at the options, both B and D have this ratio. Hmm, that's confusing. But perhaps the correct answer is D, but I can't tell. Alternatively, perhaps the options are misnumbered.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are:\n\nA) 69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nWait, that can't be. So the correct answer is 59:91, which is options B and D. But that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the total Zn and Cu. Let me try a different approach.\n\nFor alloy X:\n\n40 grams in total. Ratio 6:9 \u2192 2:3.\n\nSo Zn: (2/5)*40 =16g.\n\nCu: (3/5)*40=24g.\n\nFor Y:\n\n60 grams, ratio 7:11 \u21927/(7+11)=7/18 Zn.\n\nZn: (7/18)*60= (7*60)/18=7*(10/3)=70/3 \u224823.333g.\n\nCu: (11/18)*60= (11*10/3)=110/3\u224836.666g.\n\nTotal Zn:16 +70/3 = (48 +70)/3= 118/3.\n\nTotal Cu:24 +110/3= (72 +110)/3=182/3.\n\nRatio: 118/3 : 182/3 \u2192 118:182 \u2192 59:91.\n\nSo the correct answer is 59:91. Looking at the options, both B and D are same. So perhaps the intended correct option is D, but I can't be sure. Alternatively, perhaps the options are wrong, but the correct answer is 59:91, which is options B and D.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the options again. Let me read the user's question again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nWait, so both B and D are same. That's impossible. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, but why are both B and D same? Hmm. Maybe it's a typo, and the correct option is D, perhaps the correct option is D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct and I made a mistake. Let me think again. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternative approach: Calculate the amount of Zn and Cu from each alloy and sum.\n\nAlloy X: 40g, ratio Zn:Cu=6:9=2:3.\n\nSo Zn = (2/5)*40=16g, Cu=24g.\n\nAlloy Y:60g, ratio Zn:Cu=7:11.\n\nZn= (7/18)*60=23.333g, Cu=36.666g.\n\nTotal Zn:16 +23.333=39.333g.\n\nTotal Cu:24+36.666=60.666g.\n\nRatio Zn:Cu is 39.333 :60.666.\n\nMultiply both by 3 to eliminate decimals: 118:182 \u2192 59:91.\n\nSo the ratio is 59:91.\n\nSo looking at the options, the correct answer is either B or D, but since both are same, perhaps the intended answer is D. But in the options, both B and D are same. So perhaps the correct answer is B, but it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the options have a typo, but the correct answer is 59:91, which is options B and D. So perhaps the intended answer is D, but in the options presented, both B and D are same. Therefore, the correct answer must be either B or D, but since both are same, perhaps the correct choice is B.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should represent the fractions as exact numbers.\n\nTotal Zn: 118/3 grams.\n\nTotal Cu:182/3 grams.\n\nRatio: (118/3)/(182/3)=118/182=59/91.\n\nSo 59:91 is correct.\n\nThus, the answer is 59:91, which is option B and D. But since both are same, perhaps the correct answer is D.\n\nBut looking back at the options, perhaps I misread them. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread option D. Let me see:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nHmm, so options B and D are same. That's an error in the options. So perhaps the intended answer is B or D, but since they are same, I'll go with D.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct answer is option D, which is 59:91.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the amount of zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) in each alloy and then determine their total contributions to alloy Z.\n\n### Alloy X:\n- Ratio of Zn to Cu: **6:9** (which simplifies to **2:3**).\n- Total parts = 6 + 9 = 15.\n- Each part = \\( \\frac{40}{15} = \\frac{8}{3} \\) grams.\n- Zn in X = \\( 6 \\times \\frac{8}{3} = 16 \\) grams.\n- Cu in X = \\( 9 \\times \\frac{8}{3} = 24 \\) grams.\n\n### Alloy Y:\n- Ratio of Zn to Cu: **7:11**.\n- Total parts = 7 + 11 = 18.\n- Each part = \\( \\frac{60}{18} = \\frac{10}{3} \\) grams.\n- Zn in Y = \\( 7 \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{70}{3} \\) grams.\n- Cu in Y = \\( 11 \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{110}{3} \\) grams.\n\n### Total Zn and Cu in Alloy Z:\n- Total Zn = Zn from X + Zn from Y = \\( 16 + \\frac{70}{3} = \\frac{48}{3} + \\frac{70}{3} = \\frac{118}{3} \\) grams.\n- Total Cu = Cu from X + Cu from Y = \\( 24 + \\frac{110}{3} = \\frac{72}{3} + \\frac{110}{3} = \\frac{182}{3} \\) grams.\n\n### Ratio of Zn to Cu in Alloy Z:\n- Ratio = \\( \\frac{\\frac{118}{3}}{\\frac{182}{3}} = \\frac{118}{182} \\).\n- Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: \\( \\frac{59}{91} \\).\n- Final ratio = **59:91**.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- **A) 69:91**: Incorrect.\n- **B) 59:91**: Correct.\n- **C) 59:90**: Incorrect.\n- **D) 59:91**: Correct.\n- **E) 69:101**: Incorrect.\n\nBoth **B** and **D** represent the same ratio, **59:91**, which is the correct answer.
