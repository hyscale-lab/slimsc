      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about the ratio of volumes between a cube and a sphere that fits inside it. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let's see, the cube and the sphere. The sphere is inscribed inside the cube, right? So the sphere touches the cube exactly at the centers of each face of the cube.\n\nWait, what does that mean for their dimensions? Oh right, the diameter of the sphere must be equal to the edge length of the cube. Because if the sphere is perfectly fitting inside, the sphere's diameter can't be larger than the cube's side. So if the cube has a side length of 's', then the sphere's diameter is also 's'. That makes the sphere's radius 's/2' because radius is half the diameter.\n\nNow, I need to find the volume of the cube and the volume of the sphere. Let's start with the cube. The volume of a cube is side length cubed. So V_cube = s^3.\n\nThe sphere's volume is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. But since r is s/2, I'll substitute that in. So V_sphere = (4/3)\u03c0(s/2)^3. Let me calculate that: (4/3)\u03c0*(s\u00b3/8) = (4/3)*(1/8)\u03c0s\u00b3 = (1/6)\u03c0s\u00b3.\n\nWait, no, let me check that calculation again. (s/2)^3 is s\u00b3/(2^3) which is s\u00b3/8. Multiply by 4/3 \u03c0: (4/3) * (1/8) = (4)/(24) = 1/6. So yes, V_sphere = (\u03c0 s\u00b3)/6.\n\nSo the ratio of the cube's volume to the sphere's volume is V_cube : V_sphere = s\u00b3 : (\u03c0 s\u00b3)/6. Let's write that as s\u00b3 divided by (\u03c0 s\u00b3/6). The s\u00b3 terms cancel out, leaving 1 divided by (\u03c0/6) which is 6/\u03c0. So the ratio is 6 : \u03c0.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option D is 6:\u03c0. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait, another thought. Maybe the sphere is the one that the cube is inscribed in? Oh no, the question says the sphere fits inside the cube. So the sphere is inside, so the cube is the outer shape. So the sphere's diameter equals the cube's edge length. So the previous calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the sphere were circumscribed around the cube, then the cube's space diagonal would be equal to the sphere's diameter. But that's not the case here. The problem states the sphere fits inside the cube, so it's inscribed, not the other way around.\n\nSo the ratio is cube volume to sphere volume, which is 6:\u03c0. Looking at the options, option D is 6: \u03c0. So the answer should be D.\n",

Hmm, I remember that when a sphere fits perfectly inside a cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's get the formulas down. The volume of a cube is straightforward\u2014it's just the edge length cubed. So if the edge length is 'a', the volume V_cube = a\u00b3.\n\nNow for the sphere. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the radius. But wait, in this case, the sphere is fitting perfectly inside the cube. That means the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube. Oh right, because the sphere touches the cube exactly in the middle of each face. So the diameter of the sphere is 'a', which makes the radius r equal to a/2.\n\nSo substituting that into the sphere's volume formula, we get V_sphere = (4/3)\u03c0*(a/2)\u00b3. Let me compute that. (a/2) cubed is a\u00b3/(8), so multiply that by 4/3\u03c0: (4/3)\u03c0*(a\u00b3/8) = (4\u03c0 a\u00b3)/(24) = \u03c0 a\u00b3 /6.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that right. So 4/3 multiplied by (a/2)^3. (a/2)^3 is a\u00b3/8. So 4/3 * (a\u00b3/8) = (4 a\u00b3)/(24) = a\u00b3/6. Then multiply by \u03c0: \u03c0 a\u00b3 /6. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo now I have both volumes. The cube is a\u00b3, the sphere is \u03c0 a\u00b3 /6. The ratio is V_cube : V_sphere.\n\nSo that would be a\u00b3 : (\u03c0 a\u00b3 /6). Since a\u00b3 is in both, they cancel out. So the ratio becomes 1 : (\u03c0/6) which can be rewritten as 6:\u03c0. But wait, the question is about the ratio of cube to sphere, so it's cube divided by sphere.\n\nWait, let's see: V_cube is a\u00b3, V_sphere is (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6.

So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it: if the cube has a volume of, say, 8 units, then the sphere's volume would be (4/3)\u03c0*(2/2)^3. Wait, no, wait. If the edge length a is, say, 2 units, then the sphere's radius is 1. So sphere volume is (4/3)\u03c0(1)^3 = 4\u03c0/3. Cube volume is 2^3=8. So ratio of cube to sphere is 8/(4\u03c0/3) = 8 *3/(4\u03c0) = 24/(4\u03c0)=6/\u03c0. Yep, same result. So the ratio is 6:\u03c0. So option D.\n",
