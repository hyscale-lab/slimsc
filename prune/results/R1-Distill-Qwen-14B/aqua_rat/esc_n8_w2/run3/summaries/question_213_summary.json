      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a survey John did on car colors. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says that 60% of the people surveyed were women. That means the remaining 40% were men because 100% minus 60% is 40%. So if I let the total number of people be T, then the number of men would be 0.4 * T.\n\nNext, it says that 75% of the men preferred red cars over green cars. So that means 75% of the men liked red more than green. But wait, the problem also mentions that 10 men liked green more than red. Hmm, so if 75% prefer red, then the remaining 25% must prefer green. Because 100% -75% is 25%. \n\nSo if 25% of the men liked green, and that equals 10 men, then I can set up an equation. Let me write that down. Let the number of men be M. So 25% of M is 10. That would be 0.25 * M = 10. \n\nSolving for M: M = 10 / 0.25. Let me compute that. 10 divided by 0.25 is the same as 10 * 4, which is 40. So there are 40 men in the survey.\n\nWait, but earlier I said that the number of men is 0.4 * T. So M = 0.4 * T. Since M is 40, I can find T. So 40 = 0.4 * T. To find T, I divide both sides by 0.4. So T = 40 / 0.4. Let me calculate that. 40 divided by 0.4 is 100 because 0.4 is 2/5, and 40 times 5/2 is 100. So the total number of people surveyed is 100. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 100. So the answer should be A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the percentage of men surveyed**:  \n   The problem states that 60% of the survey participants were women, so the remaining 40% were men.

John did the survey, and some percentages are given. I need to find out how many people took the survey.\n\nAlright, let's break down the problem. The first piece of information is that 60% of the people surveyed were women. So, that means 40% were men because 100% minus 60% is 40%. So, if I let the total number of people be, say, T, then the number of men would be 40% of T, which is 0.4 * T. And the number of women would be 0.6 * T.\n\nNext, the problem says that of the men surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. Wait, so 75% of men prefer red, which means the remaining 25% prefer green. Because if 75% like red, then 100-75=25% like green more.\n\nThen, it's given that 10 men liked green cars more than red. So, these 10 men represent the 25% of the men surveyed who preferred green. Oh, so I can set up an equation here.\n\nLet me define M as the number of men surveyed. Since 25% of M is 10, I can write that as 0.25 * M = 10. So, solving for M, I divide both sides by 0.25. 10 divided by 0.25 is 40. So, M equals 40. That means there were 40 men surveyed.\n\nBut wait, M is 40% of the total survey participants. Because earlier, we said 40% of the total are men. So, M = 0.4 * T. But we just found M is 40, so 0.4 * T = 40. To find T, I can divide both sides by 0.4. So, T = 40 / 0.4. Let me compute that. 40 divided by 0.4 is the same as 40 multiplied by 2.5. 40 times 2 is 80, and 40 times 0.5 is 20, so 80 +20=100. So, T is 100.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. The options are A)100, B)120, C)50, D)200, E)80. So, 100 is option A. But I'm a bit confused because when I calculate 40 men, which is 40% of 100, that makes sense. And 10 men are 25% of 40, which is correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check my math. 25% of 40 is indeed 10 because 0.25 *40 =10. And 40 is 40% of 100, so 0.4 *100=40. Yeah, that all adds up.\n\nSo the total number of people surveyed is 100, which is option A.\n",
