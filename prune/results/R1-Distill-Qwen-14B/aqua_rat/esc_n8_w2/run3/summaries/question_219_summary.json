      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find out what percentage of the class passed based on their averages. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that passing students averaged 83, failing ones averaged 55. The overall class average is 76. I think I can approach this using weighted averages. Because the overall average is between 55 and 83, more students must have failed than passed, but wait, no, wait. Let me think. Wait, no, the overall average is 76, which is closer to 83 than to 55. Hmm, wait, 76 is 23 above 55 and 7 below 83. Oh, so maybe more students passed? Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, because if more students passed, the average would be closer to 83. Oh, right, because if the class average is 76, which is closer to 83, that suggests more high scorers, meaning a higher percentage passed. So, maybe the majority passed. Hmm, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's set up some equations.\n\nLet me denote the number of passing students as P and the number of failing students as F. The average for the class is 76, which is the total points divided by the total number of students.\n\nThe total points can be calculated in two ways. The passing students contribute 83*P points, and failing ones contribute 55*F points. So the total points are 83P + 55F.\n\nThe total number of students is P + F.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n(83P + 55F) / (P + F) = 76\n\nI can multiply both sides by (P + F) to get rid of the denominator:\n\n83P +55F = 76(P + F)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n83P +55F = 76P +76F\n\nNow, let's bring like terms together. Subtract 76P from both sides:\n\n83P -76P +55F =76F\n\nWhich is 7P +55F =76F\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me do the steps again. So after subtracting 76P and 55F from both sides, I think it's better to collect all terms on one side. Let me subtract 76P and 55F from both sides.\n\nSo 83P -76P = 76F -55F.\n\nWait, that's better. So 83P -76P is 7P, and 76F -55F is 21F.\n\nSo 7P =21F\n\nDivide both sides by 7:\n\nP = 3F\n\nHmm, so P is three times F. That means for every F students, there are 3 P students. So the ratio of P to F is 3:1.\n\nWait, wait. So if P is 3F, then the total number of students is P + F =3F +F =4F.\n\nSo the percentage of students who passed is P/(P +F) *100. Since P is 3F, and total is 4F, that's 3F /4F = 3/4. 3/4 is 75%, so 75% passed.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because I might have made a mistake. Let me see the calculations again.\n\nThe equation was:\n\n83P +55F =76P +76F\n\nSubtract 76P and 55F from both sides:\n\n7P = 21F\n\nDivide both sides by 7: P =3F.\n\nSo the ratio is P:F =3:1.\n\nSo in the class, for every 3 passers, there is 1 failer. So total is 4 parts, 3 pass, 1 fail.\n\nSo percentage passed is (3/4)*100 =75%.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 75%. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the class average is closer to the passing average. Wait, 76 is 76-55=21 above the failing average, and 83-76=7 below the passing average. So the ratio would be inverse of the distances? So the ratio of F to P is 7:21, which is 1:3. So F is 1, P is 3. So same as before, 75% passed.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer is E)75%.\n",

I remember that averages have to do with the total points divided by the number of people, right? \n\nThe problem says that the passing students had an average of 83, and the failing ones had 55. The overall class average was 76. I need to find the percentage of the class that passed. Hmm, so this must be a weighted average problem. \n\nWait, how does that work again? Oh right, if I let the number of passing students be a certain number and the failing students another, the total points would be the sum of both groups. Then the overall average is the total points divided by the total number of students.\n\nLet me think in terms of variables. Let's say the number of passing students is P and the number of failing is F. The total score for passers would be 83 * P, and for failers 55 * F. The overall total is 83P +55F. The total number of students is P + F.\n\nThe overall average is (83P +55F)/(P + F) =76. So that's the equation I need to solve.\n\nWait, but I don't know P or F. So I have one equation with two variables. Hmm, I need another equation, but wait, maybe I can express it in terms of a ratio. Like, maybe the ratio of P to F is something I can find.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. 83P +55F =76(P + F). Let's expand that: 83P +55F =76P +76F.\n\nSubtract 76P from both sides: 83P -76P +55F =76F. So that's 7P +55F =76F.\n\nWait, wait, no, wait. Let me do that again. 83P +55F =76P +76F.\n\nSubtract 76P and 55F from both sides: 83P -76P =76F -55F. That gives 7P =21F.\n\nOh, okay, so 7P equals 21F. I can simplify that by dividing both sides by 7: P =3F.\n\nSo P is three times F. That means for every F, there are three Ps. So the ratio of P to F is 3:1.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because if the passing average is higher than the overall, the number of passers should be lower, right? Because if more people passed, the average would be closer to 83. Hmm, wait, no. Let me think. The overall average is 76, which is closer to 83 than to 55. Wait, 76 is 17 points above 55 and 7 points below 83. Oh, so actually, more people must have passed. Because the average is closer to the passing score, implying more passers. Oh, so that ratio makes sense because P is 3F. So for every F, there are three Ps.\n\nWait, so if F is 1, P is 3. So total students are 4, and 3/4 passed. That's 75%. But wait, the options don't have 75% as the correct answer in the options. Wait, the options are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%.\n\nWait, but wait, I thought that the ratio was P=3F, which would make the percentage of passers 75% (since 3/(3+1) =75%). But let me check my math again because maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLet me re-calculate the equation:\n\n83P +55F =76(P + F)\n83P +55F =76P +76F\nSubtract 76P and 55F from both sides:\n\n83P -76P =76F -55F\n7P =21F\nDivide both sides by 7: P =3F.\n\nSo yes, P is three times F. So the ratio is 3:1. So in the class, 3 out of every 4 students passed, so 75%. But wait, looking at the options, E is 75%. So why is that not the correct answer? Because the options include E as 75%, which seems to fit.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because maybe I'm mixing up the ratio. Because if P=3F, then the number of passers is three times the number of failers. So the total is P + F =3F +F=4F.\n\nSo the percentage of passers is (3F /4F)*100% =75%. So E would be the answer.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember sometimes when the overall average is closer to one group's average, the proportion of that group is higher. So in this case, the overall average is closer to 83 than 55. Let's see: 83-76=7, 76-55=21. So the difference is much bigger on the failing side.
