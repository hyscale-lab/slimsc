      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says that events A and B are independent. I remember that independent events mean the occurrence of one doesn't affect the other. So, the probability of both A and B happening is the product of their individual probabilities. That is, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).\n\nThe probability that event A occurs is given as 0.6. So, P(A) = 0.6. \n\nNext, it says the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. Hmm, I think this refers to the union of A and B. So, P(A \u222a B) = 0.96.\n\nWait, how do I calculate the union of two events? Oh right, the formula is P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). But since A and B are independent, P(A \u2229 B) is just P(A)*P(B). So substituting that in, the formula becomes P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B) = 0.96.\n\nLet me plug in the values I know. P(A) is 0.6, so substituting:\n\n0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)) = 0.96\n\nLet me simplify this equation. Let's combine the terms. So:\n\n0.6 + P(B)*(1 - 0.6) = 0.96\n\nBecause 0.6 * P(B) is subtracted from P(B), so P(B) times (1 - 0.6) which is 0.4.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n0.6 + 0.4 * P(B) = 0.96\n\nNow I can solve for P(B). Subtract 0.6 from both sides:\n\n0.4 * P(B) = 0.96 - 0.6 = 0.36\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.4:\n\nP(B) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9\n\nWait, that's 0.9. Let me check the options. The options are A)0.5, B)0.6, C)0.7, D)0.8, E)0.9. So E is 0.9, which would be the answer. \n\nBut wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nWe have P(A) = 0.6, P(A \u222a B) = 0.96. Since A and B are independent, P(A \u2229 B) = 0.6 * P(B). So the union formula becomes 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)) = 0.96.\n\nWhich simplifies to 0.6 + (1 - 0.6) * P(B) = 0.96. 1-0.6 is 0.4, so 0.4 * P(B). So 0.6 + 0.4 P(B) = 0.96. Subtract 0.6: 0.4 P(B) = 0.36. Divide by 0.4: P(B)= 0.9. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be E) 0.9.\n",

So substituting that in, the equation becomes P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B).\n\nGiven that P(A) is 0.6, and P(A \u222a B) is 0.96. Let's plug those into the equation.\n\nSo, 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)).\n\nLet me simplify the right side. 0.6 plus P(B) minus 0.6 P(B). That can be written as 0.6 + (1 - 0.6) P(B). Because P(B) minus 0.6 P(B) is 0.4 P(B). So 0.6 + 0.4 P(B) = 0.96.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check that again. 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 P(B) is the same as 0.6 + (1 - 0.6) P(B), which is 0.6 + 0.4 P(B).\n\nSo 0.6 + 0.4 P(B) = 0.96.\n\nNow, subtract 0.6 from both sides. 0.4 P(B) = 0.96 - 0.6. What's 0.96 minus 0.6? That's 0.36.\n\nSo 0.4 P(B) = 0.36. To find P(B), divide both sides by 0.4. So P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4.\n\nWhat's 0.36 divided by 0.4? Hmm, 0.36 divided by 0.4 is the same as 36/40, which simplifies to 9/10, so 0.9. Wait, no, wait. 36 divided by 4 is 9, but 40 is the denominator. So 36/40 is 0.9? No, wait, 36 divided by 40 is 0.9? Let me calculate. 40 times 0.9 is 36, yes. So 36/40 is 0.9. So P(B) is 0.9? But wait, looking at the options, option E is 0.9. But wait, I'm a bit confused because the calculation suggests that, but let me double-check my steps.\n\nWait, let me go through the equation again. So:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)).\n\nSo, 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6).\n\nWhich is 0.6 + 0.4 P(B) = 0.96.\n\nSubtracting 0.6 gives 0.36 = 0.4 P(B).\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4: P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9.\n\nSo that's 90% chance. So the probability of B is 0.9, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If P(A) is 0.6, and P(B) is 0.9, then P(A \u222a B) would be 0.6 + 0.9 - (0.6*0.9) = 1.5 - 0.54 = 0.96. Which matches the given value. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. If A and B are independent, and their probabilities are 0.6 and 0.9, then the probability that neither occurs is (1 - 0.6) * (1 - 0.9) = 0.4 * 0.1 = 0.04. So the probability that at least one occurs is 1 - 0.04 = 0.96, which is correct.\n\nSo everything checks out. So the answer should be E) 0.9.\n",
