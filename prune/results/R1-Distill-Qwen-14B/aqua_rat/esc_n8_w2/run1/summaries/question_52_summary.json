      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is: A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is? And then there are five options provided.\n\nHmm, so the man's monthly income is what we're looking for. He spends 3500 and saves 12.5% of his income. Wait, wait, wait. Let me think about this. So, his total income is split into spending and saving. So, his income equals what he spends plus what he saves. But wait, the problem says he saves 12.5% of his income. So that means the remaining part is what he spends.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. If he saves 12.5%, then he's spending the rest. Because his total income is split into spending and saving. So, his income minus his savings is his spending. Or, alternatively, his spending is 100% minus 12.5% of his income.\n\nLet me try to structure this. Let's denote his monthly income as I. He saves 12.5% of I, which is 0.125 * I. So, his spending would be I minus the amount he saves. So, spending = I - 0.125 I = 0.875 I.\n\nBut wait, the problem says he spends Rs. 3500. So, 0.875 I equals 3500. So, I = 3500 / 0.875.\n\nLet me compute that. Hmm, 3500 divided by 0.875. Let me think about how to calculate that. Alternatively, I can write 0.875 as a fraction. 0.875 is the same as 7/8. Because 7 divided by 8 is 0.875. So, 3500 divided by (7/8) is the same as 3500 multiplied by (8/7). So, 3500 * 8 /7.\n\nLet me compute that. 3500 divided by 7 is 500. So, 500 multiplied by 8 is 4000. So, I is 4000.\n\nSo the man's monthly income is Rs. 4000. Looking at the options, option C is 4000. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my reasoning. Because sometimes these problems can be a bit tricky. So, if his income is 4000, 12.5% of that is 500. So, 4000 minus 500 is 3500, which is exactly what he spends. So that makes sense. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: If he saves 12.5%, that's like saving 1/8 of his income. So, the amount he saves is I/8. Then, the amount he spends is 7I/8. And that equals 3500. So, 7I/8 =3500. Multiply both sides by 8: 7I=28000. Then, I=28000/7=4000.\n\nYep, same result. So definitely, option C is the correct answer.\n",

So, I think the key here is to understand that his total income is made up of what he spends and what he saves. So, if I can find out how much he saves, I can add that to his spending to get his total income.\n\nWait, wait. Alternatively, since the problem gives his spending and the percentage he saves, maybe I can model this as:\n\nSavings = (Savings Percentage) * Income.\n\nAnd since his Income equals his Savings plus his Spending, I can set up an equation.\n\nLet me try that. Let's denote his monthly income as I. He saves 12.5% (because 1/2 is 0.5, so 12.5%) of I. So, savings S = (12.5/100) * I.\n\nAnd his spending is Rs. 3500. So, his total income I is S + 3500.\n\nSubstituting S into the equation: I = (12.5/100)*I + 3500.\n\nHmm, that makes sense. Now I can rearrange this equation to solve for I.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nI = (12.5/100) * I + 3500.\n\nLet me subtract (12.5/100)*I from both sides to get:\n\nI - (12.5/100)I = 3500.\n\nFactor out I on the left side:\n\nI [1 - (12.5/100)] = 3500.\n\nCalculate 12.5% of 100, which is 0.125. So, 1 - 0.125 = 0.875.\n\nSo, I * 0.875 = 3500.\n\nTo find I, I can divide both sides by 0.875.\n\nI = 3500 / 0.875.\n\nLet me compute that. Hmm, 3500 divided by 0.875. Alternatively, I can think of 0.875 as 7/8, because 7 divided by 8 is 0.875. So, dividing by 7/8 is the same as multiplying by 8/7.\n\nSo, 3500 * (8/7) = ?\n\n3500 divided by 7 is 500. So, 500 * 8 = 4000. So, I = 4000.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that calculation. 3500 multiplied by 8 is 28,000. Then divided by 7: 28,000 /7 is 4000. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo his monthly income is Rs. 4000. Looking at the options, option C is 4000. So, that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. Another way to think about it is that 12.5% is 1/8. So if he saves 1/8 of his income, that means he spends 7/8 of it. Because 100% minus 12.5% is 87.5%, which is 7/8.\n\nSo, spending is 7/8 of income. Spending is 3500. So,\n\n3500 = (7/8) * I.\n\nTo find I, multiply both sides by 8/7:\n\nI = 3500 * (8/7) = 4000. Yep, same answer. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be C) Rs. 4000.\n",
