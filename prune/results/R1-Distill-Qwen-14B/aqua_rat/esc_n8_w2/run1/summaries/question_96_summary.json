      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question is about some friends planning a picnic and their expenses. Hmm, I need to find out how many attended the picnic.\n\nAlright, the problem says that a group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. But then, four of them didn't show up. Because of that, the remaining people had to contribute Rs. 4 more each. My job is to find out how many attended.\n\nLet me break this down. Let's denote the number of friends who planned to come as N. So originally, each was supposed to contribute 96 divided by N. But then four didn't come, so the number of attendees became N minus 4. And each of them now has to pay Rs. 4 more than the original amount.\n\nSo the original contribution per person is 96/N. After four didn't come, each pays (96/N) + 4. And that amount is also equal to 96 divided by (N-4), because now the total expense is still 96, but split among fewer people.\n\nSo I can set up an equation. The new contribution per person is 96/(N-4) and that equals the original per person plus 4. So:\n\n96/(N-4) = (96/N) + 4.\n\nHmm, I need to solve this equation for N. Let me write that down:\n\n96/(N-4) = 96/N +4.\n\nTo solve this, maybe I can find a common denominator or cross-multiply. Let's subtract 96/N from both sides to get:\n\n96/(N-4) - 96/N =4.\n\nFactor out 96:\n\n96 [ 1/(N-4) - 1/N ] =4.\n\nSimplify the terms inside the brackets:\n\n[ (N - (N-4)) / (N(N-4)) ) ] =4/96.\n\nWait, let me compute the numerator first. 1/(N-4) minus 1/N equals [N - (N-4)] / [N(N-4)].\n\nSo the numerator is N - (N-4) = 4. So the bracket becomes 4/(N(N-4)).\n\nSo the equation now is 96 * [4/(N(N-4))] =4.\n\nMultiply 96 and 4: 96 *4 = 384.\n\nSo 384/(N(N-4)) ) =4.\n\nMultiply both sides by N(N-4):\n\n384 =4*N(N-4).\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n96 = N(N-4).\n\nSo N squared minus 4N minus 96 equals zero. Let's write that as:\n\nN^2 -4N -96 =0.\n\nNow I need to solve this quadratic equation. I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is in the form aN^2 + bN + c =0, where a=1, b=-4, c=-96.\n\nThe formula is N = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 -4ac)] / (2a).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nb^2 is (-4)^2 =16.\n\n4ac is 4*1*(-96)= -384.\n\nSo discriminant is 16 - (4*1*(-96)) = 16 + 384=400.\n\nSquare root of 400 is 20.\n\nSo N = [4 \u00b120]/2.\n\nWe have two possible solutions:\n\n(4 +20)/2 =24/2=12.\n\n(4-20)/2 = (-16)/2= -8.\n\nSince the number of people can't be negative, N=12.\n\nWait, but wait. Because N is the original number of friends. So the number of attendees is N-4=12-4=8.\n\nSo the number of people who attended is 8. Looking at the options, option A is 8.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's plug N=12 into the original scenario.\n\nEach was supposed to pay 96/12=8 Rs. Then four didn't come, so 8 attendees. Each now pays 96/8=12 Rs. So each pays 4 more. Which matches the problem statement.\n\nSo yes, the number of attendees is 8, which is option A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says that a group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables for their picnic. But then, four of them didn't show up. Because of that, the remaining people had to each contribute Rs. 4 extra. The question is asking how many people attended the picnic. The options are A)8, B)12, C)16, D)24, E)25.\n\nHmm, okay. So I think I should set up some variables to model this situation. Let me see. Let's denote the number of friends who attended as 'n'. Originally, all the friends (including the four who didn't come) were planning to split the Rs. 96. So the original number of friends would be n + 4, right? Because four didn't come, so the total was n attending plus four not attending, making n+4 total friends.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait a second. Let me clarify. The problem says four didn't turn up, so the number that attended is n, and the number that was supposed to attend was n + 4. Because n is the number that actually came, and four more were supposed to come but didn't. So the original plan was for (n + 4) people to split the Rs. 96.\n\nBut when four didn't come, only n people came. So each of those n had to pay Rs. 4 more than originally planned. So the cost per person increased by 4 Rs.\n\nLet me think about how much each person was supposed to pay initially and how much they ended up paying.\n\nOriginally, each person was supposed to pay 96 divided by (n + 4) Rs. Because the total is 96, and the number of people is n+4.\n\nAfter four people didn't come, each person paid (96 / n) Rs. Because now the same 96 is being split among n people.\n\nAnd the problem says that each person had to contribute Rs. 4 extra. So the amount each person paid after is Rs. 4 more than what they were supposed to pay initially.\n\nSo putting that into an equation: (96 / n) = (96 / (n + 4)) + 4.\n\nOkay, so now I have an equation to solve for n. Let me write that down:\n\n96/n = 96/(n+4) + 4.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me double-check. So the amount per person after is 96/n, which is 4 more than the original 96/(n+4). Yep, that makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to solve this equation for n. Let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, subtract 96/(n+4) from both sides to get:\n\n96/n - 96/(n+4) = 4.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor 96 out of the left side. Let's see:\n\n96 [1/n - 1/(n+4)] = 4.\n\nCompute the difference inside the brackets. Let's find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n1/n - 1/(n+4) = [(n+4) - n] / [n(n+4)] = (4) / [n(n+4)].\n\nSo substituting back, the equation becomes:\n\n96 * [4 / (n(n+4))] = 4.\n\nSimplify the left side: 96 *4 is 384. So 384 / [n(n+4)] = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n384 / [n(n+4)] = 4.\n\nMultiply both sides by [n(n+4)] to get rid of the denominator:\n\n384 = 4 * n(n+4).\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n96 = n(n +4).\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\nn\u00b2 +4n -96 =0.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation. Let's write it as:\n\nn\u00b2 +4n -96 = 0.\n\nI need to solve for n. Let's try factoring. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -96 and add up to +4.\n\nLet me think: 12 and -8. Because 12 * (-8) = -96, and 12 + (-8) = 4. Yes, that works.\n\nSo the equation factors as:\n\n(n +12)(n -8) =0.\n\nSo the solutions are n = -12 or n =8.\n\nBut since n represents the number of people who attended, it can't be negative. So n=8.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the algebra.\n\nLet me go through the steps again. Starting with:\n\n96/n = 96/(n+4) +4.\n\nSubtract 96/(n+4):\n\n96/n -96/(n+4) =4.\n\nFactor 96: 96 [1/n - 1/(n+4)] =4.\n\nWhich becomes 96 [ (n+4 -n) / (n(n+4)) ] =4.\n\nSo 96*(4)/(n(n+4)) =4.\n\nWhich is 384/(n(n+4))=4.\n\nMultiply both sides by n(n+4):\n\n384=4n(n+4).\n\nDivide both sides by 4: 96 =n(n+4).\n\nSo n\u00b2 +4n -96=0.\n\nFactoring: looking for two numbers that multiply to -96 and add to 4.\n\nWait, 12 and -8: 12*-8= -96; 12-8=4. So yes, factors are (n+12)(n-8)=0. So n=8.\n\nSo the number of people who attended is 8. Looking at the options, option A is 8.\n\nBut wait, wait another moment. Let me think about it differently. Because sometimes when we set up equations, we can have multiple interpretations.\n\nLet me think about it again. The total cost is 96. Initially, they thought there would be n+4 people, so each would pay 96/(n+4). But four people didn't show up, so n people paid 96/n each. The difference is 4 Rs per person.\n\nSo 96/n = 96/(n+4) +4. Which is correct.\n\nWait, but when I solved for n, I got n=8. So the number of attendees is 8, which is option A. But let me check the options. The options are A)8, B)12, etc.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think about another approach.\n\nSuppose the original number of friends was x. So they planned to each pay 96/x. But four didn't come, so x-4 people attended. Each had to pay 96/(x-4). The difference between these two is 4.\n\nSo:\n\n96/(x-4) - 96/x =4.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Let's see if this gives the same result.\n\nSo,\n\n96/(x-4) -96/x =4.\n\nFactor 96:\n\n96 [1/(x-4) -1/x ] =4.\n\nCompute the difference:\n\n[ x - (x-4) ] / [x(x-4)] =4 / [x(x-4)].\n\nSo,\n\n96 * [4/(x(x-4))] =4.\n\nSimplify:\n\n384/(x(x-4))=4.\n\nMultiply both sides by x(x-4):\n\n384=4 x(x-4).\n\nDivide both sides by4:\n\n96= x(x-4).\n\nWhich gives:\n\nx\u00b2 -4x -96=0.\n\nSolving this quadratic:\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -96 and add to -4. Let's see: 12 and -8. Because 12 * (-8) =-96, and 12 + (-8)=4. Wait, but the equation is x\u00b2 -4x -96=0. So the factors would be (x -12)(x +8)=0. So x=12 or x= -8.\n\nSo x=12 is the solution. So the original number of friends was 12. So the number of attendees is x-4=12-4=8. So again, we get 8 attendees. So the answer is A)8.\n\nWait, so why did I get the same answer using both methods? Because in the first approach, n was the number of attendees, which is 8. In the second approach, x was the original number, so 12, and attendees are 8. So both lead to the same conclusion.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is 8, which is option A.\n\nBut let me double-check with another approach. Let's plug the value of 8 into the original equation.\n\nIf n=8, then the original number was 12. So each was supposed to pay 96/12=8 Rs. But when four didn't come, 8 people paid 96/8=12 Rs each. So the difference is 12-8=4 Rs, which matches the condition.\n\nSo yes, that works. So the answer is A)8.\n",

Because the total is 96, and the number of people is n+4.\n\nAfter four people didn't come, each person paid (96 / n) Rs. Because now the same 96 is being split among n people.\n\nAnd the problem says that each person had to contribute Rs. 4 extra. So the amount each person paid after is Rs. 4 more than what they were supposed to pay initially.\n\nSo putting that into an equation: (96 / n) = (96 / (n + 4)) + 4.\n\nOkay, so now I have an equation to solve for n. Let me write that down:\n\n96/n = 96/(n+4) + 4.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me double-check. So the amount per person after is 96/n, which is 4 more than the original 96/(n+4). Yep, that makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to solve this equation for n. Let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, subtract 96/(n+4) from both sides to get:\n\n96/n - 96/(n+4) = 4.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor 96 out of the left side. Let's see:\n\n96 [1/n - 1/(n+4)] = 4.\n\nCompute the difference inside the brackets. Let's find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n1/n - 1/(n+4) = [(n+4) - n] / [n(n+4)] = (4) / [n(n+4)].\n\nSo substituting back, the equation becomes:\n\n96 * [4 / (n(n+4))] = 4.\n\nSimplify the left side: 96 *4 is 384. So 384 / [n(n+4)] = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n384 / [n(n+4)] = 4.\n\nMultiply both sides by [n(n+4)] to get rid of the denominator:\n\n384 = 4 * n(n+4).\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n96 = n(n +4).\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\nn\u00b2 +4n -96 =0.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation. Let's write it as:\n\nn\u00b2 +4n -96 = 0.\n\nI need to solve for n. Let's try factoring. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -96 and add up to +4.\n\nLet me think: 12 and -8. Because 12 * (-8) = -96, and 12 + (-8) = 4. Yes, that works.\n\nSo the equation factors as:\n\n(n +12)(n -8) =0.\n\nSo the solutions are n = -12 or n =8.\n\nBut since n represents the number of people who attended, it can't be negative. So n=8.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the algebra.\n\nLet me go through the steps again. Starting with:\n\n96/n = 96/(n+4) +4.\n\nSubtract 96/(n+4):\n\n96/n -96/(n+4) =4.\n\nFactor 96: 96 [1/n - 1/(n+4)] =4.\n\nWhich becomes 96 [ (n+4 -n) / (n(n+4)) ] =4.\n\nSo 96*(4)/(n(n+4)) =4.\n\nWhich is 384/(n(n+4))=4.\n\nMultiply both sides by n(n+4):\n\n384=4n(n+4).\n\nDivide both sides by 4: 96 =n(n+4).\n\nSo n\u00b2 +4n -96=0.\n\nFactoring: looking for two numbers that multiply to -96 and add to 4.\n\nWait, 12 and -8: 12*-8= -96; 12-8=4. So yes, factors are (n+12)(n-8)=0. So n=8.\n\nSo the number of people who attended is 8. Looking at the options, option A is 8.\n\nBut wait, wait another moment. Let me think about it differently. Because sometimes when we set up equations, we can have multiple interpretations.\n\nLet me think about it again. The total cost is 96. Initially, they thought there would be n+4 people, so each would pay 96/(n+4). But four people didn't show up, so n people paid 96/n each. The difference is 4 Rs per person.\n\nSo 96/n = 96/(n+4) +4. Which is correct.\n\nWait, but when I solved for n, I got n=8. So the number of attendees is 8, which is option A. But let me check the options. The options are A)8, B)12, etc.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think about another approach.\n\nSuppose the original number of friends was x. So they planned to each pay 96/x. But four didn't come, so x-4 people attended. Each had to pay 96/(x-4). The difference between these two is 4.\n\nSo:\n\n96/(x-4) - 96/x =4.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Let's see if this gives the same result.\n\nSo,\n\n96/(x-4) -96/x =4.\n\nFactor 96:\n\n96 [1/(x-4) -1/x ] =4.\n\nCompute the difference:\n\n[ x - (x-4) ] / [x(x-4)] =4 / [x(x-4)].\n\nSo,\n\n96 * [4/(x(x-4))] =4.\n\nSimplify:\n\n384/(x(x-4))=4.\n\nMultiply both sides by x(x-4):\n\n384=4 x(x-4).\n\nDivide both sides by4:\n\n96= x(x-4).\n\nWhich gives:\n\nx\u00b2 -4x -96=0.\n\nSolving this quadratic:\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -96 and add to -4. Let's see: 12 and -8. Because 12 * (-8) =-96, and 12 + (-8)=4. Wait, but the equation is x\u00b2 -4x -96=0. So the factors would be (x -12)(x +8)=0. So x=12 or x= -8.\n\nSo x=12 is the solution. So the original number of friends was 12. So the number of attendees is x-4=12-4=8. So again, we get 8 attendees. So the answer is A)8.\n\nWait, so why did I get the same answer using both methods? Because in the first approach, n was the number of attendees, which is 8. In the second approach, x was the original number, so 12, and attendees are 8. So both lead to the same conclusion.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is 8, which is option A.\n\nBut let me double-check with another approach. Let's plug the value of 8 into the original equation.\n\nIf n=8, then the original number was 12. So each was supposed to pay 96/12=8 Rs. But when four didn't come, 8 people paid 96/8=12 Rs each. So the difference is 12-8=4 Rs, which matches the condition.\n\nSo yes, that works. So the answer is A)8.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of friends who attended a picnic after four initially planned attendees did not show up. The total expense for eatables was Rs. 96, and the remaining attendees had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each compared to the original plan.\n\nLet the number of attendees be \\( n \\). Originally, the total number of friends was \\( n + 4 \\), and each was supposed to pay \\( \\frac{96}{n+4} \\) Rs. After four friends did not attend, the remaining \\( n \\) friends paid \\( \\frac{96}{n} \\) Rs each. According to the problem, the amount paid per person increased by Rs. 4, leading to the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{96}{n} = \\frac{96}{n+4} + 4.\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\( \\frac{96}{n+4} \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{96}{n} - \\frac{96}{n+4} = 4.\n\\]\n\nFactoring out 96:\n\n\\[\n96 \\left( \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{n+4} \\right) = 4.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the fractions:\n\n\\[\n96 \\cdot \\frac{(n+4) - n}{n(n+4)} = 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 96 \\cdot \\frac{4}{n(n+4)} = 4.\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{384}{n(n+4)} = 4.\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( n(n+4) \\):\n\n\\[\n384 = 4n(n+4).\n\\]\n\nDividing by 4:\n\n\\[\n96 = n(n+4).\n\\]\n\nRewriting as a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 4n - 96 = 0.\n\\]\n\nFactoring:\n\n\\[\n(n + 12)(n - 8) = 0.\n\\]\n\nThe solutions are \\( n = -12 \\) or \\( n = 8 \\). Since \\( n \\) represents the number of attendees, it cannot be negative, so \\( n = 8 \\).\n\nTo verify, if \\( n = 8 \\), the original number of friends was \\( 12 \\). Each was supposed to pay \\( \\frac{96}{12} = 8 \\) Rs. After four friends did not attend, the remaining \\( 8 \\) friends paid \\( \\frac{96}{8} = 12 \\) Rs each. The difference is \\( 12 - 8 = 4 \\) Rs, which matches the condition.\n\nThus, the number of attendees is **8**, corresponding to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
