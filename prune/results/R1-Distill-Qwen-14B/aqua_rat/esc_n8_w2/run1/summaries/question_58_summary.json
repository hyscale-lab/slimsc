      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about chocolates in a store. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored. So, no other options besides these two. \n\nAlright, the first piece of information is that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored. So that means the rest, which would be 90%, are vanilla flavored. Because all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa, right? So 100% minus 10% cocoa is 90% vanilla. Got that down.\n\nThen the next part says 90% of the rest are squashed. Wait, the \"rest\" here must refer to the vanilla-flavored chocolates because it's after the 10% cocoa part. So, the rest is the 90% vanilla. So, 90% of those 90% vanilla chocolates are squashed. Hmm, okay, so let me compute that.\n\nSo 90% of 90% is 0.9 * 90 = 81%. Wait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 90% of 90% would be 81% of the total chocolates? Or is it 90% of the 90% vanilla? Let me think. Oh, right, because the squashed ones are a subset of the vanilla. So, 90% of the vanilla chocolates are squashed. So if vanilla is 90%, then 90% of that is 0.9 * 90% = 81%. So 81% of total chocolates are vanilla and squashed?\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. Oh, right, so the ones that are vanilla but not squashed. So if 81% are squashed vanilla, then the remaining vanilla ones would be 90% minus 81%, which is 9%. So that's 9% of the total chocolates.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let's imagine the store has 100 chocolates for easy calculation.\n\nTotal chocolates: 100.\n\nCocoa: 10% \u2192 10 chocolates.\n\nVanilla: 90% \u2192 90 chocolates.\n\nOf the vanilla, 90% are squashed. So 90% of 90 is 81. So 81 squashed vanilla.\n\nSo the vanilla not squashed would be 90 - 81 = 9 chocolates.\n\nSo 9 out of 100, which is 9%. So the answer should be D)9%.\n\nWait, looking at the options, D is 9%. So yeah, that's the correct answer.\n",

Alright, the problem says all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored. So, the two types are vanilla and cocoa. Got that.\n\nIt says 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored. Wait, so if I consider the total number of chocolates as 100 for simplicity, 10% would be 10 chocolates. That means the rest must be vanilla, right? Because they're only vanilla or cocoa. So 100 total minus 10 cocoa is 90 vanilla. So 90% are vanilla. That makes sense.\n\nNext part: 90% of the rest are squashed. Wait, the rest refers to what? Oh, I think it's referring to the vanilla ones because the 10% cocoa is already taken out. So the rest after 10% cocoa is 90, and 90% of those are squashed. Let me calculate that. 90% of 90 is 81.
