      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party with 8 people. Now, she's having another party with 12 people, and I need to find out how many bottles she needs to buy. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14.\n\nHmm, first, I should figure out how much soda each person drinks on average. Since there were 8 people and 10 bottles, each person would have 10 divided by 8 bottles. Let me calculate that. 10 divided by 8 is 1.25. So each person, on average, drinks 1.25 bottles.\n\nNow, for the next party, there are 12 people. If each person drinks the same amount, I should multiply 12 by 1.25. Let me do that math. 12 times 1 is 12, and 12 times 0.25 is 3. So 12 plus 3 equals 15. Wait, but 15 isn't one of the options. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong here.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check the question again. Oh, the first time, Jill bought 10 bottles for 8 people. So, perhaps it's not about per person, but maybe the total. But the question is, how does the number scale? Maybe it's a direct proportion. Let me think about proportions.\n\nSo, 8 people need 10 bottles. So, for 12 people, how many? So, setting up a proportion: 8 people / 10 bottles = 12 people / x bottles. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Actually, the number of bottles is directly proportional to the number of people. So, 8 people : 10 bottles is the same as 12 people : x bottles. So, 8/10 = 12/x, but wait, no, that's not correct because the more people, the more bottles. So, the ratio should be 8:10 as 12:x, but as a proportion, it's 8/10 = 12/x. Wait, no, that's not right because 8 is to 10 as 12 is to x. So, the correct proportion would be 8/12 = 10/x? Or is it 10/8 = x/12?\n\nLet me think. If 8 people take 10 bottles, then 1 person takes 10/8 bottles. So, 12 people would take 12*(10/8) = (12*10)/8 = 120/8 = 15. So that brings me back to 15. But the options don't have 15. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that each person drinks one bottle, but the first time she bought 10 for 8, which would be more than one per person. So perhaps it's about having two per person or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Maybe she just needs to buy the same number of bottles per person, regardless of the number. Wait, but 10 bottles for 8 people is more than one per person. So, 10 divided by 8 is 1.25 per person. So for 12 people, 1.25 times 12 is 15. But again, 15 isn't an option.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that perhaps the first time, she bought 10 bottles, maybe that's for each person to have one, and an extra two. So, maybe 2 extra for the 8 people, so for 12, she might need 14? Let me think. If 8 people needed 10, that's 1 each plus 2 extra. So 12 people would need 12 plus 2, which is 14. Oh, that would make option E)14.\n\nBut wait, that's an assumption that the extra is two per party, not per person. Alternatively, perhaps she just scales it up proportionally. Alternatively, maybe the first time, it's 10 bottles for 8, so 10/8 = 1.25. So for 12, 1.25 *12 = 15. But since 15 isn't an option, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is implying that each person drinks one bottle. So, 8 people need 8 bottles, but she bought 10, so maybe she has 2 left over. So for 12 people, she needs 12 bottles. So the answer would be D)12.\n\nWait, but in the first scenario, she bought 10 for 8, which is more than one per person. So perhaps she's being cautious, buying 25% more per person. So 8 *1.25=10. Then 12 *1.25=15. But since 15 isn't an option, maybe she's buying one per person, so 12.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a proportional approach. Let's see, 8 people need 10. So 12 is 1.5 times 8. So 10 *1.5=15, but again, not an option. So perhaps the problem is intended to think that she needs to buy one bottle per person, so 12.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a simple ratio. 8 people :10 bottles. So 12 people would be (12/8)*10 = 15. But since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the problem expects rounding up to the nearest option given. The options are 6,8,10,12,14. 15 is not present. Hmm.\n\nWait, another angle. Maybe the number of bottles is the same regardless of the number of people. But that doesn't make sense because more people would need more soda. So that's probably not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial 10 bottles are enough for 8 people, meaning each person had 1.25, but maybe she only needs to buy 10 again, thinking each person will have the same as before. But that doesn't make sense for 12 people. Or perhaps she just scales up the initial number. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find how many more bottles she needs to buy. But no, the question says how many in total. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that 8 people drank 10 bottles, so each person drinks 1.25. For 12, it's 15, but perhaps she can't buy a fraction, so she rounds up to 15. But since 15 isn't an option, maybe she needs to buy 14, which is the closest option provided. But that's a bit of a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have 10 bottles for 8 people, so 10 divided by 8 is 1.25 per person. For 12 people, 12 *1.25 is 15. But since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is 12, which is option D.\n\nWait, but why would that be the case? Maybe the problem expects that each person has one bottle, so 12. But that doesn't fit with the first scenario where 8 people needed 10.\n\nWait, maybe the first scenario is 10 bottles for 8 people, meaning that each person has a little more than one. So for 12, she needs 12 * (10/8) =15. But since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is 14, but that's not matching either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question. The first time, 8 people, 10 bottles. So maybe for each additional person, she buys 1.25 more bottles. So for 12 people, which is 4 more than 8, 4 *1.25=5. So 10+5=15. Again, not an option.\n\nWait, another approach. Maybe the number of bottles is 10 when 8 people attend. So, maybe the number of bottles is fixed at 10, regardless of the number of people. But that doesn't make sense because 12 people would need more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is E)14, but I'm not sure why. Maybe the problem expects a simple ratio without considering the decimal, but that's unclear.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is assuming that each person drinks one bottle, so 12 people would need 12. But that doesn't align with the first scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the number of bottles is the same as the number of people, so 12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem might be that each person drinks one bottle, so 12 people would need 12. So the answer would be D)12.\n\nBut why was the first scenario 10 for 8? Maybe that's a red herring, and the question is implying that each person needs one bottle. So regardless of the initial number, the answer is 12. That might be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about how many more she needs to buy beyond the initial 10, but the question says \"how many bottles...will she need to buy\". So it's the total.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the initial 10 bottles were for 8 people, so for 12, it's 10 + (12-8)*something. But without knowing how much per additional person, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of bottles is directly proportional. So 8 \u219210, 12 \u2192 x. So 8/10=12/x \u2192 cross multiply, 8x=120 \u2192x=15. But 15 isn't an option.\n\nHmm. Since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is D)12, assuming each person drinks one. Or perhaps the problem expects that the number of bottles is 10 regardless, which is option C.\n\nBut that wouldn't make sense for 12 people. So maybe the correct approach is to go with the proportion, even if it's not an option. But that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is implying that she buys the same number as before, 10, regardless of the number of people. But that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about how many more she needs to buy, but the question says \"how many bottles of soda will she need to buy\", which suggests the total.\n\nI'm a bit stuck here. Let me think of the options again. The options are 6,8,10,12,14.\n\nSo, if 8 people require 10 bottles, which is 1.25 per person. 12 people would require 15. But since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is 14, but that would mean 14/12 is about 1.16 per person. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting a simple ratio where 8 people have 10 bottles, so 12 people would have (10 *12)/8=15. Again, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14.\n\nIf the answer isn't 15, perhaps the problem expects that each person drinks one bottle, so 12.\n\nBut why would she have 10 for 8? That would mean each person drinks a little more than one. So perhaps for 12, she needs 15, but since that's not an option, perhaps the problem is expecting that each person gets one bottle, so 12. So answer D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that 10 bottles for 8 people implies 2 bottles per person on average. So 10/8 is 1.25 per person. So for 12 people, 12*1.25=15. Not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is 14.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the question is a trick, and the correct answer is the same as the previous, 10. But that doesn't make sense because more people would need more bottles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a simple ratio, but maybe the question is asking for how many more she needs to buy, but that's not what the question says.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the number of bottles per person. So for 8 people, 10 bottles, which is 1.25 per person. For 12, 12 *1.25 =15. But since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is E)14, which is the closest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects to round down, so 15 becomes 14. But that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the number of bottles is the same as the number of people. So 8 people, 8 bottles, but she bought 10. So perhaps for 12 people, 12 bottles. So answer D.\n\nBut why would she buy 10 for 8? That's not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe the correct approach is to go with the proportion, even if it's not an option, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is E)14, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that each person drinks 1.25 bottles, so 12 *1.25=15, but since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is E)14.\n\nWait, but why 14? 14 is 12 + 2, which is the same as 10 being 8 + 2. So perhaps she adds 2 bottles regardless of the number of people. So for 8, 10, for 12, 12 +2=14. So option E.\n\nThat makes sense. So the answer would be E)14.\n",

Hmm, the question is asking how many bottles she needs to buy when there are 12 people attending, based on her previous purchase.\n\nWait, in the first scenario, she bought 10 bottles for 8 people. So maybe I can find out how much soda each person drinks on average. Let me calculate that. So 10 bottles divided by 8 people. Let me do the math: 10 \u00f7 8 equals 1.25. Oh, so each person drinks 1.25 bottles on average.\n\nNow, if there are 12 people coming to the next party, I can multiply 1.25 by 12 to find out how many bottles she needs. Let me compute that: 1.25 times 12. Hmm, 1.25 *12... Well, 12 times 1 is 12, and 12 times 0.25 is 3, so adding them together gives 15. So she would need 15 bottles.\n\nWait, but the options given are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. Oh wait, 15 isn't one of the options. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. Maybe the problem is assuming that each person drinks one bottle. Because 8 people, 10 bottles. Oh wait, that's more than one per person. So 10 bottles for 8 people. So each person would have a little more than a bottle. But if that's the case, when 12 people come, she might need more than 12 bottles, but the options don't go beyond 14.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is just looking for a proportional increase. So 10 bottles for 8 people, so per person it's 10/8, which is 1.25. So for 12 people, 1.25 *12 = 15. But since 15 isn't an option, maybe I should consider that perhaps she can't buy a fraction of a bottle, so she rounds up. But 15 isn't there either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Maybe the question is implying that the number of bottles scales linearly with the number of people. So if 8 people need 10 bottles, then per person is 10/8 = 1.25. So for 12 people, 12 *1.25 is 15. Again, but no 15 option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a trick question. Maybe she needs to buy the same number of bottles regardless of the number of people. But that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the initial data is a ratio. Let me think: 10 bottles for 8 people, so how much per person? 10/8 = 1.25, as before. So for 12, it's 15. But since 15 isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is implying that the number of people doesn't change the number of bottles. Like, maybe she only needs 10 bottles regardless. But that seems unlikely. Or maybe it's a direct ratio, but perhaps it's a different ratio. Wait, 10 bottles for 8 people, so the ratio is 5:4. So for 12 people, how many bottles? Let me set up a proportion.\n\nSo, 8 people : 10 bottles = 12 people : x bottles.\n\nSo 8/10 = 12/x. Cross-multiplying gives 8x = 120, so x = 120/8 =15. Again, 15. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the question is expecting a different approach. Like, perhaps each person drinks one bottle, so 12 people would need 12. But then why did she buy 10 for 8? Oh, perhaps the initial 10 was more than needed, but that doesn't make sense because 10 is less than 8. Wait, wait, no, 10 bottles for 8 people. So that's more than one per person.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial data is a typo, but that's not my problem to fix. So I have to work with what's given.\n\nWait, the options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the scaling. Let me check again.\n\n8 people \u219210 bottles.\n\nSo for 1 person, 10/8=1.25 bottles.\n\n12 people \u219212 *1.25=15.\n\nBut 15 isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be the case. So maybe I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps she buys 10 bottles for 8 people, which is 1.25 per person. For 12 people, 12 *1.25=15. But since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the question is looking for the nearest option, but that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the initial ratio is different.\n\nWait, maybe it's 10 bottles for 8 attendees, which is 1.25 per person. But perhaps she only needs to have enough for each person to have one bottle. So 12 people would need 12. That would make sense, but then why did she buy 10 for 8? Maybe she's being thrifty, but that's not relevant to the calculation. So perhaps the answer is 12, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a proportion problem, but perhaps the initial is 8 people need 10 bottles, so per person 1.25. So for 12 people, 15 is needed. Since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is 14, but that's not right. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that she needs to have enough for each person to have one bottle. So 12 would be needed. So D)12. But that would ignore the initial ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the number of bottles scales with the number of people, perhaps a fixed ratio.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the number of bottles is directly proportional to the number of people. So 8 \u219210, so the rate is 10/8 = 1.25. So 12 people \u219212 *1.25=15, but since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the answer is E)14, but that seems off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting us to see that 8 people require 10 bottles, so 12 is 50% more people. So 10 +5=15. But again, no option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is a trick. Maybe the first party had 8 attendees, but 10 bottles, meaning 2 bottles extra. So maybe for 12, she buys 14. But that's a big assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the ratio of people. So 12 is 1.5 times 8. So 10 *1.5=15. But no 15.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that she needs to buy 10 bottles regardless, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recheck.\n\n10 bottles for 8 people. So per person, 10/8=1.25 bottles.\n\nSo 12 people: 12 *1.25=15. So she needs 15 bottles. But since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is E)14, but that's not matching.\n\nWait, looking at the options, E is 14. 14 is 10 +4, but that's not a proportional increase.\n\nWait, maybe the initial data is 8 attendees, 10 bottles. So per person 1.25. So 12 people would require 15, but since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is E)14. But that's not correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The options given are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14.\n\nIf I have to choose from these, perhaps the intended approach is to assume that each person drinks one bottle. So 12 people \u219212 bottles. So D)12.\n\nBut that doesn't account for the initial 10 bottles for 8 people, which would mean each person drinks more than one. So perhaps the problem expects us to just scale the number of people, but maybe it's a direct proportion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a ratio problem, but maybe it's a simple proportion where 8 people correspond to 10 bottles, so 12 people would be (10/8)*12 =15. But since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that can't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the number of bottles is the same as the number of people. So 8 people, 8 bottles. But that's not what the question says. The question says she bought 10 for 8.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem expects us to realize that 10 bottles are for 8 people, so perhaps the number of bottles is the same as the number of people. So 12 people \u219212 bottles. But that doesn't align with the initial data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the minimum number of bottles needed, assuming each person has one, so 12, which is D.\n\nBut I'm confused because the initial data suggests more than one per person.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a direct proportion. So 8 people \u219210 bottles.\n\nSo 12 people \u2192 x bottles.\n\nSet up the proportion: 8/10 =12/x \u2192 cross multiply 8x=120 \u2192x=15. So 15, which isn't an option.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is designed to have an answer not in the options, but that's impossible. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that she needs to buy the same number of bottles as the number of people. So 12 people \u219212 bottles. So D)12.\n\nBut that doesn't fit with the initial data. Alternatively, perhaps the initial data is a typo and should be 8 people needing 8 bottles. But that's not the question here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simply asking to buy the same number as before, 10, but that's option C.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense because the number of people has increased.\n\nHmm, maybe the correct answer is E)14, but I don't see why. Because 10 + (2 *4)=18? No, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to calculate 10 * (12/8) =15, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is E)14.\n\nWait, but 12 people is 1.5 times 8. So 10*1.5=15.\n\nSince 15 isn't an option, perhaps the answer is not provided, but that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is a trick and the answer is 10, but that would be if the number of attendees doesn't affect the number of bottles, which is unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the correct answer is E)14, but I'm not sure why.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's see, the initial data is 8 people, 10 bottles. So each person gets 10/8=1.25 bottles.\n\nSo for 12 people, 12 *1.25=15.\n\nBut since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the problem expects us to round up to the nearest whole number. So 15 \u2192 but no option. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to think that each person only has one, so 12.\n\nBut that doesn't fit with the initial data. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a direct proportion, but perhaps the initial ratio is 8:10, which simplifies to 4:5. So for 12 people, the number of bottles would be (5/4)*12 =15.\n\nBut again, 15 isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting to multiply 10 by (12/8) =1.5 \u219215. But no option.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is intended to have an answer not listed, but that's impossible. So perhaps the intended answer is E)14, but I can't see why.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a simple ratio where 8 \u219210, so 12 would be 14.5, which is approx 14 or 15, but E is 14.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate 10*(12/8)=15, but since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is E)14, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting us to calculate the same number per person. So 10 bottles for 8 people is 1.25 each. So 12 would need 15, but no option. So perhaps the intended answer is E)14, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 8 people \u219210 bottles.\n\nSo for 1 person, 10/8=1.25.\n\nSo for 12, 12 *1.25=15. But no option.\n\nWait, maybe the question is implying that she needs to have the same number of extra bottles. 8 people, 10 bottles: 2 extra. So 12 people, 14 (12 +2). So option E)14.\n\nBut why would she have 2 extra for 8 people? Maybe she wants to have 2 extra in case. So for 12, she adds 2 again, making it 14.\n\nBut that's a big assumption. The problem doesn't state that she's adding a fixed number of extras, only that she bought 10 for 8.\n\nHmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe the correct answer is E)14, but I'm not confident.\n\nWait, let's see the options again: E is 14, which is 10 +4, but why 4? Because 12-8=4, so adding 4 to 10 makes 14. But that's a simplistic approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D)12, assuming each person has one bottle.\n\nBut the initial data says she bought 10 for 8, which is more than one per person. So maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the initial ratio and just buy one per person, making the answer 12.\n\nBut I'm not sure. I think the correct approach is to calculate based on the initial ratio, leading to 15. Since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is E)14.\n\nWait, but another possibility: perhaps the question is a simple proportion, and the options are rounded. 15 rounds to 14, but that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to think that each person drinks one bottle, so 12 people \u219212 bottles. So D)12.\n\nBut the initial data says she bought 10 for 8, which is 1.25 per person. So why would she buy exactly 12 for 12? That would mean each person drinks exactly one. But perhaps the problem is implying that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed to have an answer of 12, so D is correct.\n\nI think I've spent enough time. The initial calculation suggests 15, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D)12.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine how many bottles of soda Jill needs to buy for a party with 12 attendees, we start by analyzing the given data: she bought 10 bottles for 8 people.

So option E)14.\n\nBut why would she have 2 extra for 8 people? Maybe she wants to have 2 extra in case. So for 12, she adds 2 again, making it 14.\n\nBut that's a big assumption. The problem doesn't state that she's adding a fixed number of extras, only that she bought 10 for 8.\n\nHmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe the correct answer is E)14, but I'm not confident.\n\nWait, let's see the options again: E is 14, which is 10 +4, but why 4? Because 12-8=4, so adding 4 to 10 makes 14. But that's a simplistic approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D)12, assuming each person has one bottle.\n\nBut the initial data says she bought 10 for 8, which is more than one per person. So maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the initial ratio and just buy one per person, making the answer 12.\n\nBut I'm not sure. I think the correct approach is to calculate based on the initial ratio, leading to 15. Since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is E)14.\n\nWait, but another possibility: perhaps the question is a simple proportion, and the options are rounded. 15 rounds to 14, but that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to think that each person drinks one bottle, so 12 people \u219212 bottles. So D)12.\n\nBut the initial data says she bought 10 for 8, which is 1.25 per person. So why would she buy exactly 12 for 12? That would mean each person drinks exactly one. But perhaps the problem is implying that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed to have an answer of 12, so D is correct.\n\nI think I've spent enough time. The initial calculation suggests 15, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D)12.\n\n\nTo determine how many bottles of soda Jill needs to buy for a party with 12 attendees, we start by analyzing the given data: she bought 10 bottles for 8 people. This suggests that each person consumes an average of:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{8} = 1.25 \\, \\text{bottles per person}.\n\\]\n\nFor 12 people, the total number of bottles required would be:\n\n\\[\n12 \\times 1.25 = 15 \\, \\text{bottles}.\n\\]\n\nHowever, 15 is not one of the provided options. This discrepancy suggests that the problem may not strictly follow the proportional relationship derived from the initial data. Instead, the options imply a simpler assumption: each person consumes exactly one bottle. If we adopt this assumption, then for 12 people, Jill would need:\n\n\\[\n12 \\, \\text{bottles}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the most reasonable answer based on the given options is **D) 12**, even though it does not align perfectly with the proportional calculation. \n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about how many bottles of soda Jill needs to buy for a party. \n\nSo, the first scenario is that Jill needed 10 bottles for a party with 8 people. Now, the question is, how many does she need if 12 people are coming? The options are A to E, with numbers ranging from 6 to 14. Hmm.\n\nWait, I think this is a proportion problem. Like, figuring out how much soda per person. So, when there were 8 people, 10 bottles were needed. So maybe I can find out how much each person drinks on average, and then multiply that by 12 to find the new number.\n\nLet me calculate that. So, 10 bottles for 8 people. That would mean each person drinks 10 divided by 8 bottles. Let me compute that. 10 \u00f7 8 is 1.25. So each person has 1.25 bottles on average. \n\nNow, if there are 12 people, then the total would be 12 multiplied by 1.25. Let me do that math. 12 times 1.25. Well, 12 times 1 is 12, and 12 times 0.25 is 3, so adding them together gives 15. Wait, but 1.25 times 12 is 15? Let me check again. 1.25 is the same as 5/4, so 12 * (5/4) is (12/4)*5 = 3*5=15. Yes, that's right. \n\nBut wait, the options don't have 15. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. Oh, that's a problem. Hmm. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Because 15 isn't an option, perhaps the initial assumption about the rate is incorrect.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the problem isn't about per person consumption. Maybe it's more about the ratio between the number of people and the bottles. So, if 8 people needed 10 bottles, maybe the ratio is 10:8, which simplifies to 5:4. So for every 4 people, she needs 5 bottles. \n\nIf that's the case, then for 12 people, how many sets of 4 are there? 12 divided by 4 is 3. So each set of 4 people needs 5 bottles. So 3 sets would be 3 times 5, which is 15. Again, same problem as before\u201415 isn't an option.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Are there other ways to interpret the problem? Maybe the 10 bottles were for 8 people, implying that each person gets 1 bottle, and then some extra. Wait, 10 bottles for 8 people could mean each person gets a little over 1 bottle. But that's not matching the options.\n\nWait, maybe the question is more about the number of people and the number of bottles being directly proportional. So, the number of people is increasing from 8 to 12, which is a 50% increase (since 12 is 1.5 times 8). So, if she had 10 bottles for 8, multiplying 10 by 1.5 would give the new number of bottles needed. Let me calculate that: 10 * 1.5 is 15. Again, same as before.\n\nBut since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect. Maybe the problem is not about per person, but about the number of attendees and the number of bottles in a different way.\n\nWait another angle: perhaps it's a ratio question where the number of people is inversely proportional to the number of bottles. No, that doesn't make sense because more people would need more bottles, not fewer. So that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 10 bottles are for 8 people, implying that each person gets 1 bottle and there are 2 extra. So, 8 people: 8 bottles, 2 extra. So, perhaps the extra is based on the number of people. But that approach also doesn't directly solve the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the question is a simple ratio without considering decimals. Let me think: 8 people need 10 bottles. So, the ratio is 8:10, which simplifies to 4:5. So, for 12 people, we can set up a proportion: 4/5 = 12/x. Solving for x: cross multiply gives 4x = 5 * 12 \u2192 4x=60 \u2192 x=15. Again, same result.\n\nBut the options don't have 15. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"If Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended, how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending?\"\n\nWait, maybe it's a trick question. Perhaps she only buys enough for each person to have one bottle. So, 8 people needed 8, but she bought 10. So, she bought two extra. If 12 people attend, she needs to buy 12 plus two, which is 14. That would be option E.\n\nWait, but that's assuming she buys one per person plus two extra, but the initial was 10 for 8. So 8 people, 10 bottles. So, 2 extra. So, perhaps for 12, she buys 12 + 2 =14. That would make sense, and 14 is an option (E).\n\nBut why would she buy two extra for 8? Maybe that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the 10 bottles is exactly how much is needed for 8 people, so perhaps 8 people drink 10 bottles, meaning each person drinks 1.25, as before.\n\nWait, but why isn't 15 an option? Maybe the problem expects you to round up to the nearest whole number. Because you can't buy a fraction of a bottle. So, if 12 people each drink 1.25, that's 15, but since you can't buy a fraction, she needs 15 bottles. But again, that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a ratio based on the number of people, but the answer is not directly calculated. Maybe the answer is that she needs the same number, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial 10 bottles is for 8 attendees, but perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the question is implying that each person drinks 1 bottle, and the extra is based on the number of attendees.\n\nWait, let's think of it this way: 8 people, 10 bottles. So each person gets 1.25 bottles. For 12 people, 12 * 1.25 =15. But 15 isn't an option, so perhaps the problem expects to round up to the next whole number, but 15 isn't an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a simple proportion, and the intended answer is 15, but since that's not an option, I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that each person drinks a certain number of bottles, but perhaps the initial setup is different. Let me think again. \n\nWait another approach: the number of bottles increases in the same ratio as the number of people. So the ratio of people is 8 to 12, which is 2:3. So the number of bottles would also increase in the same ratio. So 10 bottles * (12/8) = 10 * 1.5 =15. Again, same result.\n\nBut since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the problem expects us to think that the number of bottles is directly proportional to the number of people. So 8 people \u219210 bottles. So, 1 person \u219210/8=1.25 bottles. 12 people \u219212 *1.25=15. Again, same.\n\nHmm. So why isn't 15 an option? Maybe the question is actually expecting a different approach. Maybe it's a simple ratio that I'm not seeing.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the initial 10 bottles are for 8 attendees, and each attendee drinks 1.25 bottles. But maybe for the new party, each attendee only drinks 1 bottle. Then 12 people would need 12 bottles. So the answer would be D)12. But why would the per-person consumption change? The problem doesn't state that, so that's probably not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that each person drinks the same amount as before, but she only buys enough so that no one is short. So she needs to buy 15, but since that's not an option, perhaps the next best is 14, which is option E. But that doesn't make sense because 14 is less than 15.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about the same consumption rate but about a fixed number. Like, the number of bottles is independent of the number of people. But that would be strange because the question says 'how many will she need to buy', implying that it's based on the number of attendees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where the number of bottles is the same, regardless of the number of people. So 10 bottles for 8, and 10 for 12. But that would mean option C)10. But that doesn't make sense because more people would need more soda.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a simple ratio and the answer is 15, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D)12. Because 12 is 1.5 times 8, and 10 times 1.5 is 15, but perhaps the problem expects to round down, which would be 12. But that's not accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick, and the answer is 10 because she's the same person. But that doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the question again. Maybe it's a simple proportion where 8 people correspond to 10 bottles, so 12 people correspond to (10 *12)/8 =15 bottles. But again, 15 isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the number of bottles is based on the number of people divided by two. So 8 people, 4 bottles. But that doesn't fit with 10. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a unit conversion problem. Like, 10 bottles for 8 people, so per person is 10/8=1.25. For 12 people, 12*1.25=15. But again, 15 isn't an option.\n\nWait, maybe the question expects you to approximate. 1.25 is 5/4, so 12*(5/4)=15. But perhaps the answer expects you to round down, but 15 is more than 14, which is an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting you to use the same number of bottles per person, but perhaps it's 1 bottle per person, so 12 people need 12 bottles. But that would be option D, but why would the initial be 10 for 8? That would be 1.25 per person. So the same approach would mean 15 for 12.\n\nI'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14.\n\nSo, 10 bottles for 8 people. Let me see, 10 is 1.25 times 8. So 1.25 per person. So 12 *1.25=15. But 15 is not an option.\n\nWait, maybe the question is a simple ratio where 8 people to 12 people is 2:3. So, 10 bottles multiplied by 3/2 gives 15. But again, 15 is not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a trick where you have to buy a whole number of cases, but the problem doesn't mention cases. So, perhaps the intended answer is E)14, but that's not matching the math.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the number of bottles is directly proportional to the number of people, but the initial is 10 for 8. So, 8:10 is the ratio, which simplifies to 4:5. So, 12 people would require (5/4)*12=15.\n\nBut again, 15 isn't an option. So perhaps the problem expects an approximate answer, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recheck: 8 people, 10 bottles. So per person is 10/8 = 1.25. So for 12 people, 12 *1.25=15.\n\nBut the options don't have 15. So maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let's think outside the box.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the 10 bottles are for 8 people, so each person gets one bottle, and there are two extra. So, the number of extra bottles is 2. So, for 12 people, she needs 12 + 2 =14 bottles. So that would be option E)14.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the initial was 8 people, 10 bottles. So each person gets one bottle, and there are two left. So, if 12 people attend, she buys 12 +2 =14 bottles. So, option E.\n\nThat seems plausible. So, the answer would be E)14.\n",

But again, 15 is not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a trick where you have to buy a whole number of cases, but the problem doesn't mention cases. So, perhaps the intended answer is E)14, but that's not matching the math.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the number of bottles is directly proportional to the number of people, but the initial is 10 for 8. So, 8:10 is the ratio, which simplifies to 4:5. So, 12 people would require (5/4)*12=15.\n\nBut again, 15 isn't an option. So perhaps the problem expects an approximate answer, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recheck: 8 people, 10 bottles. So per person is 10/8 = 1.25. So for 12 people, 12 *1.25=15.\n\nBut the options don't have 15. So maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let's think outside the box.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the 10 bottles are for 8 people, so each person gets one bottle, and there are two extra. So, the number of extra bottles is 2. So, for 12 people, she needs 12 + 2 =14 bottles. So that would be option E)14.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the initial was 8 people, 10 bottles. So each person gets one bottle, and there are two left. So, if 12 people attend, she buys 12 +2 =14 bottles. So, option E.\n\nThat seems plausible. So, the answer would be E)14.\n\n\nTo determine how many bottles of soda Jill needs to buy for a party with 12 people, we start by analyzing the given information: 10 bottles were needed for 8 people. This suggests that the number of bottles is proportional to the number of attendees.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the ratio of bottles to people\nFor 8 people, 10 bottles were required. The ratio of bottles to people is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{10 \\, \\text{bottles}}{8 \\, \\text{people}} = 1.25 \\, \\text{bottles per person}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Apply the ratio to 12 people\nIf each person consumes 1.25 bottles, then for 12 people, the total number of bottles needed is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total bottles} = 12 \\, \\text{people} \\times 1.25 \\, \\text{bottles/person} = 15 \\, \\text{bottles}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Reconcile with the answer choices\nThe calculated result of 15 bottles is not among the provided options (A) 6, (B) 8, (C) 10, (D) 12, (E) 14. This discrepancy suggests that the problem may involve a different interpretation, such as rounding or an alternative approach.\n\n### Step 4: Alternative interpretation\nIf we assume that Jill buys enough bottles for each person to have one bottle and adds a fixed number of extra bottles, the initial scenario of 10 bottles for 8 people implies 2 extra bottles. Applying this pattern, for 12 people, Jill would need:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total bottles} = 12 \\, \\text{people} + 2 \\, \\text{extra bottles} = 14 \\, \\text{bottles}.\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the options and the alternative interpretation, the most reasonable answer is **14 bottles**.\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party with 8 people. Now, she needs to figure out how many bottles for a party with 12 people. The options are A to E, with numbers ranging from 6 to 14.\n\nWait, I think this is a proportion problem. Like, how much soda per person. Because if 8 people needed 10 bottles, maybe each person drinks a certain number of bottles. But wait, maybe it's a ratio problem.\n\nLet me think. For 8 people, she bought 10 bottles. So per person, that's 10 divided by 8. Let me calculate that. 10 divided by 8 is 1.25. So each person would have 1.25 bottles? That seems a bit odd because you can't really have a fraction of a bottle in real life, but maybe it's an average or something.\n\nWait, maybe it's more about the ratio. So, the ratio of soda bottles to people is 10:8. That can be simplified, right? Let's see. Both are divisible by 2. So 10/2 is 5, 8/2 is 4. So the ratio is 5:4. So for every 4 people, she needs 5 bottles.\n\nSo if there are 12 people, how many groups of 4 are there? Let me divide 12 by 4. That's 3. So each group of 4 needs 5 bottles. So 3 groups would need 5 times 3, which is 15. Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are up to 14. Hmm, did I do something wrong?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe it's a direct proportion. So the number of bottles is directly proportional to the number of people. So if 8 people needed 10 bottles, then 12 people would need (10 * 12) /8. Let me compute that.\n\n10 multiplied by 12 is 120. Divided by 8 is 15. Again, 15 isn't an option. Hmm. So that can't be right. What's the problem here?\n\nWait, maybe the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the soda per person is different. Let me think again. 10 bottles for 8 people. So per person is 10/8 = 1.25. So for 12 people, 12 * 1.25. Let me calculate that. 12 * 1 is 12, 12 * 0.25 is 3. So 12 +3 =15. Again, 15. So why isn't 15 an option?\n\nWait, the options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. So 15 isn't there. Did I misunderstand the question? Maybe it's not per person. Maybe 10 bottles for 8 people is all they had, but perhaps each person drinks the same amount, and the ratio is fixed.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the number of bottles is the same regardless of the number of people? But that can't be right because more people would need more soda. But the options don't go higher than 14, and 15 is needed according to calculations.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the number of bottles per person. So for 8 people, 10 bottles. So per person, 10/8=1.25. For 12 people, 12*1.25=15. But again, 15 isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me check the initial problem again. Oh, wait! The first party had 8 attendees and 10 bottles. The second has 12 attendees. So perhaps the soda needed is the same as the number of people. Wait, but 12 is an option (D). But that doesn't fit with the initial 8 people needing 10 bottles.\n\nWait another idea: Maybe each person drinks a bottle and a bit more. So maybe 10 for 8 is 1.25 each. So for 12, 12 * 1.25 is 15. But that's not an option. So perhaps the question is implying that each person drinks one bottle, and any extra is just for the host or something. So for 8 people, 8 bottles, but she bought 10. So perhaps she bought two extra. So for 12 people, she buys 12 +2=14? So option E is 14. Hmm.\n\nWait, that seems a bit of a stretch, but maybe. Because 10 bottles for 8 people: 8 plus 2. So 12 would be 12 plus 2, which is 14. That would make E the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is 10 bottles per 8 people, so 10/8 = 5/4. So for 12 people, 12*(5/4)=15, which isn't an option. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of bottles is 10 when 8 people attend, so maybe for each additional person, she needs 10*(12-8)/8 more. But that would be 10*(4/8) =5 more. So 10+5=15, again not an option.\n\nHmm, I'm confused. The options don't include 15, so perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Maybe it's not a direct proportion. Maybe the question is a trick. Like, if 8 people need 10 bottles, perhaps 12 people would need 10 plus 4 more, making 14. Because 12-8=4, so adding 4. So 10+4=14. That would be option E.\n\nBut that seems like a linear approach, but is it proportional? Let me see. 8 people:10 bottles. 12 is 1.5 times 8. So 10 *1.5=15. But that's not an option. So maybe she just adds 4 more, not multiplying. So 10 +4=14. So E.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Another way: maybe each person consumes 1.25 bottles, as we thought before. So for 12 people, 12 *1.25 is 15, but that's not an option. So maybe the question assumes that each person drinks one bottle, and the 10 bottles is an overestimation. So for 8 people, she bought 10, but maybe she only needs 12 for 12 people. So 12. But then why did she buy 10 for 8? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a ratio based on the number of attendees, but without considering fractions. So if 8 people take 10 bottles, the ratio is 10:8, which is 5:4. So for 12 people, we need to find how many X such that 12: X is 5:4. Wait, no. Wait, the ratio of people to bottles is 8:10, which is 4:5. So for 12 people, X bottles, the ratio is 12: X = 4:5. So cross multiply: 4X=60, so X=15. Again, 15 isn't an option.\n\nWait, maybe I inverted the ratio. Let me try again. If the ratio of people to bottles is 8:10, which is 4:5. So for 12 people, we can set up the proportion: 8/10 =12/X.\n\nCross-multiplying, 8X=120 \u2192 X=15. Again, same result.\n\nHmm. So none of the options are 15. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the soda is shared among the attendees, so maybe each person gets 1.25 bottles, but she can't buy a fraction, so she rounds up. But 12*1.25=15, so she'd need 15. But again, that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the number of bottles per person. If she bought 10 for 8, maybe each person gets 1.25, but for 12 people, she can't buy a fraction, so she rounds up to 15, but that's not an option. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that 8 people had 10 bottles, so each person drinks 1.25. So for 12, 15. But since the options don't have 15, perhaps the intended approach is that she buys the same number per person, but perhaps the answer is 12, D.\n\nWait, but that would mean each person drinks 10/8=1.25, but for 12, 12*1.25=15, which is not an option. So perhaps the intended approach is to see that 8 people need 10, so 12 is 1.5 times 8, so 10 *1.5=15. But no option. So I'm stuck.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about the number of bottles per person. Wait, 10 bottles for 8 people is 1.25 per person. So for 12 people, 12 *1.25=15, but again, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe the 10 bottles were for 8 attendees, meaning each attendee gets 1.25. But perhaps the intended answer is to round to the nearest whole number, but that would be 12, which is option D. Wait, no, 1.25 times 12 is 15. Rounding to 15, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question assumes that each person has one bottle, so 8 people:8 bottles, but she bought 10. So maybe she bought 2 extra. So for 12 people, she needs 12 plus 2=14. So option E.\n\nThat might be the intended approach. Because 10 bottles for 8 people, maybe 2 extra. So 12 people would need 12 +2=14.\n\nBut why would she buy 2 extra for 8 people? Maybe for the host or something. So perhaps the extra is 2. Then for 12, 12+2=14. So E is the answer.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: perhaps the number of bottles is 10 for 8 people, so the number of bottles per person is 10/8=1.25. For 12 people, 12 *1.25=15. But that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is a trick, and the answer is 10 because she only needs 10 regardless of the number of people. But that can't be right because more people would need more soda.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the number of soda bottles needed is the same as the number of people. So for 8 people, 8 bottles. But she bought 10, which is more. But the question is asking for 12 people, so she needs 12 bottles. So D)12.\n\nWait, that would make sense. But the initial data says she bought 10 for 8 people. So perhaps the correct approach is to think that per person, it's 1 bottle. So 12 people, 12 bottles. So D.\n\nBut why did she buy 10 for 8? Maybe she thought each person would have 1.25, but that's 10. But that's not matching the options.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the number of bottles is the same as the number of people. So for 8, she needs 8, but she bought 10, which is more. But for 12, she needs 12, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of bottles is the same as the number of people. So 8 people:8 bottles. But she bought 10, so maybe she had extra. But the question is about what she needs to buy, not what she has. So perhaps she needs to buy 12 for 12 people. So D.\n\nBut the initial problem says she bought 10 for 8 people. So perhaps she had 10 for 8, so 10 bottles for 8 people, so per person 1.25. So for 12, 15. But that's not an option. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about the number of bottles per person, but she can't buy a fraction. So she needs to round up. So 1.25 per person, so 12 *1.25=15. She can't buy 15, so she buys 14? Or 16? But 14 is an option, E.\n\nWait, 15 isn't an option, so perhaps 14 is the closest. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the number of bottles is the same per person, so 10 for 8, so 125 per person. So 12 *1.25=15. So the answer should be 15, but it's not there. So perhaps the intended answer is E)14.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Another angle: maybe the problem is that each bottle serves a certain number of people. Like, each bottle is for two people, so 8 people would need 4 bottles. But she bought 10, which doesn't fit. Hmm, that complicates it more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial data is a distraction. Maybe the answer is 10, same as before. But that doesn't make sense because more people would need more soda.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is a ratio problem where the number of bottles is the same as the number of people. So 8:10 becomes 12:15, but 15 isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is 10, but that's not logical.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let's try to think differently. The problem is giving two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: 8 people \u2192 10 bottles.\n\nScenario 2: 12 people \u2192 ? bottles.\n\nThe options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14.\n\nAssuming a direct proportion, the number of bottles needed is proportional to the number of people.\n\nSo, (number of bottles) = k * (number of people), where k is a constant.\n\nFrom scenario 1: 10 = k *8 \u2192 k=10/8=1.25.\n\nSo for scenario 2: number of bottles =1.25 *12=15.\n\nBut 15 isn't an option. So perhaps this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the number of bottles is the same as the number of people. So for 8 people, 8 bottles. But she bought 10. So perhaps she had extra. But the question is about how many she needs to buy, so for 12, she needs 12. So D.\n\nBut that doesn't align with the initial data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of bottles is the same regardless of the number of people. So she buys 10 for any number, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each person drinks 1.25 bottles, but she can't buy a fraction. So she needs to round up. So 12 *1.25=15. But she can't buy 15, so she buys 14? No, that's not the way rounding works. 15 is the exact amount, but it's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick, and the answer is 10. So C. But that would imply that regardless of the number of people, she needs 10, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a simple ratio. 8 people:10 bottles. So 12 people: X bottles. The ratio is 8:10 =12:X.\n\nCross-multiplying: 8X=120 \u2192 X=15. Again, not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's 10:8 =X:12. So 10/8 =X/12 \u2192 X= (10 *12)/8=15.\n\nSame result.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the intended answer is E)14, but I'm not sure why. Maybe the question expects you to round down. 15\u219214. But that's not standard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that each person drinks one bottle, and the extra is for the host. So 8 people:8 bottles, plus 2 for the host, total 10. So for 12 people, 12 +2=14. So E)14.\n\nThat seems plausible. So the answer would be E.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine how many bottles of soda Jill needs to buy for a party with 12 attendees, we start by analyzing the given data: for 8 people, she bought 10 bottles.

For 8 people, she bought 10 bottles. So per person, that's 10 divided by 8. Let me calculate that. 10 divided by 8 is 1.25. So each person would have 1.25 bottles?

So, the ratio of soda bottles to people is 10:8. That can be simplified, right? Let's see. Both are divisible by 2. So 10/2 is 5, 8/2 is 4. So the ratio is 5:4.

But since the options don't have 15, perhaps the intended approach is that she buys the same number per person, but perhaps the answer is 12, D.\n\nWait, but that would mean each person drinks 10/8=1.25, but for 12, 12*1.25=15, which is not an option. So perhaps the intended approach is to see that 8 people need 10, so 12 is 1.5 times 8, so 10 *1.5=15. But no option. So I'm stuck.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about the number of bottles per person. Wait, 10 bottles for 8 people is 1.25 per person. So for 12 people, 12 *1.25=15, but again, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe the 10 bottles were for 8 attendees, meaning each attendee gets 1.25. But perhaps the intended answer is to round to the nearest whole number, but that would be 12, which is option D. Wait, no, 1.25 times 12 is 15. Rounding to 15, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question assumes that each person has one bottle, so 8 people:8 bottles, but she bought 10. So maybe she bought 2 extra. So for 12 people, she needs 12 plus 2=14. So option E.\n\nThat might be the intended approach. Because 10 bottles for 8 people, maybe 2 extra. So 12 people would need 12 +2=14.\n\nBut why would she buy 2 extra for 8 people? Maybe for the host or something. So perhaps the extra is 2. Then for 12, 12+2=14. So E is the answer.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: perhaps the number of bottles is 10 for 8 people, so the number of bottles per person is 10/8=1.25. For 12 people, 12 *1.25=15. But that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is a trick, and the answer is 10 because she only needs 10 regardless of the number of people. But that can't be right because more people would need more soda.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the number of soda bottles needed is the same as the number of people. So for 8 people, 8 bottles. But she bought 10, which is more. But the question is asking for 12 people, so she needs 12 bottles. So D)12.\n\nWait, that would make sense. But the initial data says she bought 10 for 8 people. So perhaps the correct approach is to think that per person, it's 1 bottle. So 12 people, 12 bottles. So D.\n\nBut why did she buy 10 for 8? Maybe she thought each person would have 1.25, but that's 10. But that's not matching the options.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the number of bottles is the same as the number of people. So for 8, she needs 8, but she bought 10, which is more. But for 12, she needs 12, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of bottles is the same as the number of people. So 8 people:8 bottles. But she bought 10, so maybe she had extra. But the question is about what she needs to buy, not what she has. So perhaps she needs to buy 12 for 12 people. So D.\n\nBut the initial problem says she bought 10 for 8 people. So perhaps she had 10 for 8, so 10 bottles for 8 people, so per person 1.25. So for 12, 15. But that's not an option. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about the number of bottles per person, but she can't buy a fraction. So she needs to round up. So 1.25 per person, so 12 *1.25=15. She can't buy 15, so she buys 14? Or 16? But 14 is an option, E.\n\nWait, 15 isn't an option, so perhaps 14 is the closest. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the number of bottles is the same per person, so 10 for 8, so 125 per person. So 12 *1.25=15. So the answer should be 15, but it's not there. So perhaps the intended answer is E)14.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Another angle: maybe the problem is that each bottle serves a certain number of people. Like, each bottle is for two people, so 8 people would need 4 bottles. But she bought 10, which doesn't fit. Hmm, that complicates it more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial data is a distraction. Maybe the answer is 10, same as before. But that doesn't make sense because more people would need more soda.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is a ratio problem where the number of bottles is the same as the number of people. So 8:10 becomes 12:15, but 15 isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is 10, but that's not logical.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let's try to think differently. The problem is giving two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: 8 people \u2192 10 bottles.\n\nScenario 2: 12 people \u2192 ? bottles.\n\nThe options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14.\n\nAssuming a direct proportion, the number of bottles needed is proportional to the number of people.\n\nSo, (number of bottles) = k * (number of people), where k is a constant.\n\nFrom scenario 1: 10 = k *8 \u2192 k=10/8=1.25.\n\nSo for scenario 2: number of bottles =1.25 *12=15.\n\nBut 15 isn't an option. So perhaps this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the number of bottles is the same as the number of people. So for 8 people, 8 bottles. But she bought 10. So perhaps she had extra. But the question is about how many she needs to buy, so for 12, she needs 12. So D.\n\nBut that doesn't align with the initial data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of bottles is the same regardless of the number of people. So she buys 10 for any number, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each person drinks 1.25 bottles, but she can't buy a fraction. So she needs to round up. So 12 *1.25=15. But she can't buy 15, so she buys 14? No, that's not the way rounding works. 15 is the exact amount, but it's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick, and the answer is 10. So C. But that would imply that regardless of the number of people, she needs 10, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a simple ratio. 8 people:10 bottles. So 12 people: X bottles. The ratio is 8:10 =12:X.\n\nCross-multiplying: 8X=120 \u2192 X=15. Again, not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's 10:8 =X:12. So 10/8 =X/12 \u2192 X= (10 *12)/8=15.\n\nSame result.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the intended answer is E)14, but I'm not sure why. Maybe the question expects you to round down. 15\u219214. But that's not standard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that each person drinks one bottle, and the extra is for the host. So 8 people:8 bottles, plus 2 for the host, total 10. So for 12 people, 12 +2=14. So E)14.\n\nThat seems plausible. So the answer would be E.\n\n\nTo determine how many bottles of soda Jill needs to buy for a party with 12 attendees, we start by analyzing the given data: for 8 people, she bought 10 bottles. This suggests a relationship between the number of people and the number of bottles. \n\n### Step 1: Calculate soda per person\nFor 8 people, 10 bottles were purchased. Dividing the total bottles by the number of people gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Soda per person} = \\frac{10}{8} = 1.25 \\, \\text{bottles/person}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Apply to 12 people\nFor 12 people, the total number of bottles needed would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total bottles} = 12 \\times 1.25 = 15 \\, \\text{bottles}.\n\\]\n\nHowever, 15 is not one of the provided options. This indicates that the problem may involve an alternative interpretation or assumption.\n\n### Step 3: Consider rounding or alternative assumptions\nSince 15 is not an option, one possible interpretation is that the problem assumes rounding down to the nearest whole number, resulting in 14 bottles. Another interpretation could be that the initial 10 bottles for 8 people include extra bottles for the host or other purposes, and this pattern continues. For example, if 2 extra bottles were purchased for 8 people, then for 12 people, 12 attendees plus 2 extra bottles would give:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total bottles} = 12 + 2 = 14.\n\\]\n\nThis aligns with option E.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the direct calculation suggests 15 bottles, the lack of this option and the possibility of an alternative interpretation (e.g., rounding or including extra bottles) make 14 the most plausible answer based on the given choices.\n\nAnswer: E",
