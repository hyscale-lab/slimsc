      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this multiplication problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe multiplication table is set up like this:\n\n   M A D\n\u00d7   B E\n----------\n   M A D\nR A E\n----------\nA M I D\n\nHmm, so it's a multiplication of a three-digit number MAD by a two-digit number BE, resulting in a four-digit number AMID. Wait, no, wait. Let me look again. The way it's written, MAD is multiplied by BE. The partial products are MAD and RAE, and the total is AMID.\n\nWait, so the multiplication is done as:\n\n      MAD\n    \u00d7 BE\n    -------\n      MAD      (this must be MAD \u00d7 E)\n    RAE       (this must be MAD \u00d7 B, shifted one position to the left)\n    -------\n    AMID\n\nSo, the structure is similar to how we do multiplication by hand. So, the first partial product is MAD multiplied by E, and the second partial product is MAD multiplied by B, but shifted left by one (which is equivalent to multiplying by 10), and then added together to get AMID.\n\nEach letter represents a unique digit, I think. So, M, A, D, B, E, R, I are all digits, right? So, all letters must be between 0-9, and no two letters can have the same digit unless specified otherwise. Wait, but the question doesn't specify if they're unique, but in most cryptarithmetic puzzles, each letter represents a unique digit. So I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nLet me note down the variables:\n\n- MAD is a three-digit number: M is the hundreds digit, A the tens, D the ones.\n- BE is a two-digit number: B is tens, E is ones.\n- The product is AMID, a four-digit number: A is thousands, M hundreds, I tens, D ones.\n\nSo, the multiplication is:\n\nMAD \u00d7 BE = AMID.\n\nWait, but that's a three-digit times two-digit giving a four-digit number. So, MAD must be in the range such that when multiplied by BE (which is up to 99), the result is four digits. So MAD must be at least 100, but since it's three digits, that's given. The product AMID is four digits, so MAD \u00d7 BE must be >= 1000. Since MAD is up to 999, BE can be as low as 2 (since 1000/999 is ~1.001, so BE must be at least 2). So BE is between 2 and 99.\n\nLooking at the partial products:\n\nFirst partial product is MAD \u00d7 E. Let's denote that as P1 = MAD \u00d7 E.\n\nSecond partial product is MAD \u00d7 B \u00d7 10, so P2 = (MAD \u00d7 B) shifted left by one (\u00d710).\n\nSo, P1 + P2 = AMID.\n\nWait, but looking at the way the problem is written, the partial products are MAD and RAE, so perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the multiplication setup:\n\n      MAD\n    \u00d7  BE\n    -------\n       MAD      (this is E \u00d7 MAD)\n     RAE        (this is B \u00d7 MAD, shifted left by one)\n    -------\n    AMID\n\nSo, the first partial product is E \u00d7 MAD, written as MAD. So, E \u00d7 MAD must end with D as the units digit. Wait, that's because when you multiply MAD by E, the units digit is D \u00d7 E, which must give a units digit of D. So, D \u00d7 E mod 10 = D. That implies that E \u00d7 D ends with D. So, what digits E satisfy this?\n\nHmm, let's think about possible D and E values.\n\nSo, D \u00d7 E \u2261 D mod 10. That equation can be rewritten as D \u00d7 (E -1) \u2261 0 mod 10.\n\nSo, either D is 0 or E is 1, or D and (E-1) multiply to a multiple of 10.\n\nWait, if D is 0, then any E would work because 0 \u00d7 E =0, which is D. So D could be 0. Alternatively, if E is 1, then any D would satisfy D \u00d71 = D, so E could be 1. Another possibility is that D \u00d7 (E-1) is a multiple of 10. So, D could be 5 and E-1 could be 2 (so E=3), because 5\u00d72=10. Or D could be 2 and E-1=5 (so E=6), but 2\u00d75=10. Or D= 6, E-1= 5 (since 6\u00d75=30), but wait 6\u00d75=30, which is 0 mod 10. Alternatively, D=5 and E=3 (since 5\u00d72=10), which is 0 mod10.\n\nSo possibilities:\n\nCase 1: D=0, any E.\n\nCase 2: E=1, any D.\n\nCase 3: D and E-1 such that D*(E-1) is a multiple of 10.\n\nLet me note this and proceed.\n\nAlso, from the first partial product (MAD \u00d7 E = MAD), the product is MAD. Wait, no, because if you multiply MAD by E, you get a number that's MAD, but perhaps that's not the case. Wait, no, the first partial product is MAD \u00d7 E, which is written as MAD. Wait, that can't be unless E is 1, because if E is 1, then MAD \u00d71 = MAD, so the partial product is MAD. Otherwise, if E is greater than 1, the product would be a different number.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. Let me think again. The first partial product is MAD \u00d7 E, and in the multiplication setup, it's written as MAD. So, that would mean that E must be 1, because MAD \u00d7 1 = MAD. So, E is 1.\n\nWait, but what if the product is three digits? Because MAD is a three-digit number, and E is a single digit. So, if E is 1, then the product is MAD \u00d71 = MAD, which is correct. So the first partial product is MAD, and the second partial product is MAD \u00d7 B shifted left by one (so it's MAD \u00d7 B \u00d710). Then, when you add MAD and RAE (which is MAD \u00d7 B \u00d710), you get AMID.\n\nSo, E must be 1. Because if E were anything else, the first partial product would not be MAD. Wait, unless E is 1, so that's the only possibility. So, E =1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that E could be 3 if D is 5, but now, this suggests that E must be 1. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate.\n\nWait, the partial product is MAD \u00d7 E, written as MAD. So, the units digit of MAD \u00d7 E must be D. But E can't be 1 unless E is 1, but let me think: if E is 1, then the product is MAD, which fits. So that's a strong indication that E is 1.\n\nSo, E=1.\n\nSo, from this, in the first partial product, MAD \u00d7 1 = MAD, which is correct. So the first partial product is MAD, and the second is B \u00d7 MAD \u00d710, which is written as RAE, but wait, no. Wait, the second partial product is written as R A E, but shifted left by one. Wait, no, the way the multiplication is written is:\n\n      MAD\n    \u00d7  BE\n    -------\n       MAD      (E=1)\n     RAE        (B \u00d7 MAD, but shifted left by one)\n    -------\n    AMID\n\nSo, the second partial product is B \u00d7 MAD, but written shifted left by one, so it's RAE shifted left by one, which would be RA E, but I'm not sure. Wait, the second partial product is B \u00d7 MAD, which is a three-digit number, but when shifted left by one, it's a four-digit number? Or is it that when you shift a three-digit number left by one, it becomes a four-digit number if the first digit is non-zero.\n\nWait, but in the multiplication setup, the second partial product is written as RAE, but in the way it's written, it's one digit shifted left, so it's R A E, but perhaps it's actually R A E with an implied zero? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps RAE is a three-digit number, but when shifted left by one, it's a four-digit number, R A E 0? No, that doesn't fit. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second partial product is B \u00d7 MAD, which is a three-digit number, and when shifted left by one, it's a four-digit number, so perhaps the leading digit is R, and the next digits are A and E, but that would make RAE a three-digit number shifted left by one, which is a four-digit number: R A E 0? No, because when you shift left by one, you add a zero at the end, not the beginning.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: when you perform the multiplication, each partial product is written as if you're adding digits. So, for example, if MAD is 123, and BE is 45, then you multiply 123 \u00d75 =615, and 123 \u00d74=492, shifted left by one (so 4920), then add 615 +4920 =5535.\n\nIn this problem, the first partial product is MAD \u00d7 E, which is written as MAD, so E must be 1. The second partial product is MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one, written as RAE. Wait, but when you shift left by one, you add a zero at the end, but in the problem, the partial product is written as RAE, which is three digits. That suggests that MAD \u00d7 B is a three-digit number, and when shifted left by one, it's four digits, but in the problem it's written as RAE, which is three digits. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the problem is written is that the second partial product is RAE, but it's actually written as RAE shifted left by one, meaning that it's RAE0, but that would be four digits. But the way it's presented, the sum is AMID, which is four digits. So, perhaps the second partial product is a three-digit number RAE, but when shifted left, it's RAE0, making it four digits. But that doesn't make sense because the way the problem is written, the second partial product is RAE, but in the multiplication setup, it's written one line down, which would imply it's shifted left by one, so it's a four-digit number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of it as:\n\nMAD \u00d7 E = MAD (so E must be 1)\n\nMAD \u00d7 B \u00d710 = RA E (but wait, RA E is a three-digit number, but when you multiply by 10, it should be four digits. Hmm, that doesn't add up. So perhaps the second partial product is a three-digit number, but when shifted left by one, it's a four-digit number, which is RA E followed by a zero? No, that can't be, because the sum would then be MAD (three digits) plus RA E0 (four digits) = AMID (four digits). So, let me try to write the equations.\n\nLet me denote the numbers as:\n\nMAD = 100*M + 10*A + D\n\nBE = 10*B + E\n\nAMID = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D\n\nThe first partial product is MAD \u00d7 E = MAD, which is only possible if E=1.\n\nSo, E=1.\n\nThen, the second partial product is MAD \u00d7 B, but written shifted left by one, so it's (MAD \u00d7 B) \u00d710. But in the problem, this is written as RAE. Wait, RAE is a three-digit number, but (MAD \u00d7 B) \u00d710 is a four-digit number. So perhaps in the problem, the partial product is written as RAE, but actually it's RA E shifted left, so the actual value is RAE0, making it four digits.\n\nWait, but then the sum of MAD (three digits) and RAE0 (four digits) would be AMID (four digits).\n\nWait, but in the problem, the sum is:\n\n   MAD\n+ RAE0\n= AMID\n\nSo, the sum is a four-digit number.\n\nSo, let's model this.\n\nMAD \u00d71 = MAD \u2192 P1 = MAD.\n\nMAD \u00d7 B \u00d710 \u2192 P2 = (MAD \u00d7 B) \u00d710.\n\nSo, P1 + P2 = AMID.\n\nSo, MAD + (MAD \u00d7 B \u00d710) = AMID.\n\nWhich can be written as MAD \u00d7 (B \u00d710 + 1) = AMID.\n\nBut since BE is 10*B + E, which is 10*B +1, because E=1.\n\nSo, MAD \u00d7 (10*B +1) = AMID.\n\nBut AMID is a four-digit number, so MAD must be such that when multiplied by (10*B +1), it gives a four-digit number.\n\nSo, since MAD is a three-digit number, the product will be four digits only if MAD \u00d7 (10*B +1) >= 1000.\n\nSince MAD is at least 100, 10*B +1 must be at least 10 (since 100 \u00d710=1000). So B must be at least 1, but since E is 1 and letters are unique, B can't be 1, unless the problem allows it. Wait, but I assumed all letters represent unique digits, so E is 1, so B can't be 1. So B is at least 2.\n\nSo, B is between 2 and 9.\n\nSo, now, let's model the equation:\n\nMAD \u00d7 (10*B +1) = AMID.\n\nBut MAD is 100*M +10*A + D.\n\nAMID is 1000*A + 100*M +10*I + D.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n(100*M +10*A + D) \u00d7 (10*B +1) = 1000*A + 100*M +10*I + D.\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n(100M +10A + D) \u00d7 (10B +1) = (100M +10A + D)*10B + (100M +10A + D)*1.\n\nSo,\n\n= (100M \u00d710B) + (10A \u00d710B) + (D \u00d710B) + 100M +10A + D\n\n= 1000MB + 100AB + 10B D + 100M +10A + D.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n1000MB + 100AB +10B D + 100M +10A + D = 1000A + 100M +10I + D.\n\nWe can subtract D from both sides:\n\n1000MB +100AB +10B D +100M +10A = 1000A +100M +10I.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\n1000MB +100AB +10B D +100M +10A -1000A -100M -10I = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n1000MB +100AB +10B D + (100M -100M) + (10A -1000A) -10I = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n1000MB +100AB +10B D -990A -10I = 0.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I should look for some patterns or constraints.\n\nWe know E=1, so E is 1.\n\nLet's think about the first partial product, which is MAD \u00d71 = MAD. So, no issues there.\n\nNow, the second partial product is MAD \u00d7 B, which is a three-digit number, because when multiplied by 10, it's a four-digit number (RAE0). Wait, but RAE is a three-digit number. So, the second partial product is RAE, which is MAD \u00d7 B, and then shifted left by one (\u00d710), making it RAE0. So, the second partial product is (MAD \u00d7 B) \u00d710, which is RAE0.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the second partial product is written as RAE, but perhaps it's actually (MAD \u00d7 B) written as RAE, and then shifted left by one, making it RAE0. So, when you add MAD (three digits) and RAE0 (four digits), you get AMID (four digits).\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n   MAD\n+ RAE0\n= AMID\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nMAD + RAE0 = AMID.\n\nSo, let's model this.\n\nMAD is 100M +10A + D.\n\nRAE is 100R +10A + E, but E=1, so RAE is 100R +10A +1.\n\nWhen shifted left by one, it's RAE0 = (100R +10A +1) \u00d710 = 1000R +100A +10.\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n(100M +10A + D) + (1000R +100A +10) = 1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\n100M +10A + D +1000R +100A +10 = 100M + (10A +100A) + (D +10) +1000R.\n\nWhich is 100M +110A + (D +10) +1000R.\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n100M +110A + D +10 +1000R = 1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nSubtract D from both sides:\n\n100M +110A +10 +1000R = 1000A +100M +10I.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\n1000R +100M +110A +10 = 1000A +100M +10I.\n\nSubtract 100M from both sides:\n\n1000R +110A +10 = 1000A +10I.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side:\n\n1000R +110A +10 -1000A -10I =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n1000R - 890A +10 -10I =0.\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n100 R -89 A +1 - I =0.\n\nSo,\n\n100 R -89 A +1 = I.\n\nHmm, I is a single digit (0-9), so 100 R -89 A +1 must be between 0 and 9.\n\nSo,\n\n0 \u2264 100 R -89 A +1 \u22649.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n-1 \u2264 100 R -89 A \u22648.\n\nSince R and A are digits (0-9), let's see possible values.\n\nBut let's think about R and A.\n\nR is the leading digit of RAE, which is MAD \u00d7 B. So, since MAD is a three-digit number (>=100) and B is at least 2, MAD \u00d7 B is at least 200. So, RAE is a three-digit number where R is at least 2.\n\nWait, RAE is the product of MAD \u00d7 B, which is a three-digit number. So, R is the hundreds digit of that product. Since MAD is >=100 and B >=2, MAD \u00d7 B can be as low as 200 (if MAD is 100 and B is 2), so R can be 2 or higher.\n\nBut let's proceed with the equation:\n\nI =100 R -89 A +1.\n\nSince I must be between 0 and 9, let's consider possible R and A values.\n\nBut 100 R is a multiple of 100, and 89 A is a multiple of 89. So, let's see:\n\nFor I to be a digit (0-9), 100 R -89 A +1 must be between 0 and 9.\n\nSo,\n\n100 R -89 A +1 \u22650 \u2192 100 R \u226589 A -1.\n\nAnd,\n\n100 R -89 A +1 \u22649 \u2192 100 R \u226489 A +8.\n\nLet me consider possible R and A values.\n\nR can be from 2 to 9 (since RAE is a three-digit number, R can't be zero).\n\nLet's try R=2.\n\nThen,\n\n100*2 -89 A +1 \u22649 \u2192 200 -89A +1 \u22649 \u2192 201 \u226489A +9 \u2192 89A \u2265192 \u2192 A \u2265 2.157 \u2192 A \u22653.\n\nAnd,\n\n100*2 -89 A +1 \u22650 \u2192 201 -89A \u22650 \u2192 89A \u2264201 \u2192 A \u22642.258. But A must be >=3 from earlier. Contradiction. So R=2 is impossible.\n\nNext, R=3.\n\n100*3=300.\n\nSo,\n\n300 -89A +1 \u22649 \u2192 301 -89A \u22649 \u2192 89A \u2265292 \u2192 A\u2265292/89 \u22483.28, so A\u22654.\n\nAnd,\n\n301 -89A \u22650 \u2192 89A \u2264301 \u2192 A \u2264301/89 \u22483.38. So A can be 3 only.\n\nBut from above, A must be >=4. So no solution for R=3.\n\nNext, R=4.\n\n100*4=400.\n\nSo,\n\n400 -89A +1 \u22649 \u2192 401 -89A \u22649 \u2192 89A \u2265392 \u2192 A \u2265392/89 \u22484.404 \u2192 A\u22655.\n\nAnd,\n\n401 -89A \u22650 \u2192 89A \u2264401 \u2192 A \u2264401/89 \u22484.49 \u2192 A can be 4.\n\nBut from above, A must be >=5, which is a contradiction. So no solution.\n\nR=5.\n\n100*5=500.\n\nSo,\n\n500 -89A +1 \u22649 \u2192 501 -89A \u22649 \u2192 89A \u2265492 \u2192 A \u2265492/89 \u22485.528 \u2192 A\u22656.\n\nAnd,\n\n501 -89A \u22650 \u2192 89A \u2264501 \u2192 A \u22645.573 \u2192 A=5.\n\nBut A must be >=6.

Yes, that matches.\n\nSo the letters would be:\n\nM=2, A=9, D=7,\n\nB=3, E=1,\n\nR=8, I=0.\n\nSo, the digits are all unique, which fits the cryptarithmetic rules.\n\nSo, the possible answer is when the digits are:\n\nA=9, M=2, D=7, B=3, E=1, R=8, I=0.\n\nLooking at the options, the options are four-digit numbers, but the question is to find the digits for A, M, D, and another digit.

So R=9 is impossible.\n\nThus, the only solution is R=8, A=9, I=0, and B=3, MAD=297, BE=31, product=9207, which is option D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves deciphering a multiplication table where the three-digit number **MAD** is multiplied by the two-digit number **BE**, resulting in the four-digit number **AMID**. The multiplication setup is as follows:\n\n```\n   MAD\n\u00d7   BE\n----------\n    MAD      (MAD \u00d7 E)\n  RAE        (MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one)\n----------\n  AMID\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **E = 1**: The first partial product is **MAD \u00d7 E**, which is written as **MAD**. This implies that multiplying **MAD** by **E** results in **MAD** itself, meaning **E = 1**.\n\n2. **Second Partial Product**: The second partial product is **MAD \u00d7 B**, shifted left by one, written as **RAE**. This means **MAD \u00d7 B** is a three-digit number, and when shifted left by one, it becomes **RAE0**.\n\n3. **Sum of Partial Products**: Adding the two partial products, **MAD + RAE0**, results in the four-digit number **AMID**.\n\n### Equation Setup:\nThe multiplication can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\text{MAD} \\times (10B + 1) = \\text{AMID}\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n(100M + 10A + D) \\times (10B + 1) = 1000A + 100M + 10I + D\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\\[\n1000MB + 100AB + 10BD + 100M + 10A = 1000A + 100M + 10I\n\\]\nRearranging terms:\n\\[\n1000R - 89A + 1 = I\n\\]\nHere, **I** is a single digit (0-9), so:\n\\[\n0 \\leq 100R - 89A + 1 \\leq 9\n\\]\n\n### Solving for R, A, and I:\n- **R** is the hundreds digit of **RAE**, which is the product of **MAD \u00d7 B**. Since **MAD** is a three-digit number and **B** is at least 2, **R** must be at least 2.\n- Testing possible values for **R** and **A**, the only valid solution is **R = 8**, **A = 9**, and **I = 0**. This satisfies the equation:\n\\[\nI = 100R - 89A + 1 = 100(8) - 89(9) + 1 = 800 - 801 + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Determining MAD and B:\n- From **RAE = 891**, we know **MAD \u00d7 B = 891**. Testing possible values for **B** (2-9, excluding 1 and 9), the only valid solution is **B = 3**, giving **MAD = 297**.\n\n### Verification:\n- **MAD = 297**, **BE = 31** (since **B = 3**, **E = 1**).\n- The multiplication is:\n\\[\n297 \\times 31 = 9207\n\\]\n- The product **9207** matches **AMID**, where **A = 9**, **M = 2**, **I = 0**, and **D = 7**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe digits are **A = 9**, **M = 2**, **D = 7**, **B = 3**, **E = 1**, **R = 8**, and **I = 0**. The four-digit product **AMID** is **9207**, which corresponds to option **D**.\n\n**Answer: D**",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this multiplication problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe multiplication table is set up like this:\n\n   M A D\n\u00d7   B E\n----------\n   M A D\nR A E\n----------\nA M I D\n\nHmm, so it's a multiplication of a three-digit number MAD by a two-digit number BE, resulting in a four-digit number AMID. Wait, no, wait. Let me look again. The way it's written, MAD is multiplied by BE. The partial products are MAD and RAE, and the total is AMID.\n\nWait, so the multiplication is done as:\n\n      MAD\n    \u00d7 BE\n    -------\n      MAD      (this must be MAD \u00d7 E)\n    RAE       (this must be MAD \u00d7 B, shifted one position to the left)\n    -------\n    AMID\n\nSo, the structure is similar to how we do multiplication by hand. So, the first partial product is MAD multiplied by E, and the second partial product is MAD multiplied by B, but shifted left by one (which is equivalent to multiplying by 10), and then added together to get AMID.\n\nEach letter represents a unique digit, I think. So, M, A, D, B, E, R, I are all digits, right? So, all letters must be between 0-9, and no two letters can have the same digit unless specified otherwise. Wait, but the question doesn't specify if they're unique, but in most cryptarithmetic puzzles, each letter represents a unique digit. So I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nLet me note down the variables:\n\n- MAD is a three-digit number: M is the hundreds digit, A the tens, D the ones.\n- BE is a two-digit number: B is tens, E is ones.\n- The product is AMID, a four-digit number: A is thousands, M hundreds, I tens, D ones.\n\nSo, the multiplication is:\n\nMAD \u00d7 BE = AMID.\n\nWait, but that's a three-digit times two-digit giving a four-digit number. So, MAD must be in the range such that when multiplied by BE (which is up to 99), the result is four digits. So MAD must be at least 100, but since it's three digits, that's given. The product AMID is four digits, so MAD \u00d7 BE must be >= 1000. Since MAD is up to 999, BE can be as low as 2 (since 1000/999 is ~1.001, so BE must be at least 2). So BE is between 2 and 99.\n\nLooking at the partial products:\n\nFirst partial product is MAD \u00d7 E. Let's denote that as P1 = MAD \u00d7 E.\n\nSecond partial product is MAD \u00d7 B \u00d7 10, so P2 = (MAD \u00d7 B) shifted left by one (\u00d710).\n\nSo, P1 + P2 = AMID.\n\nWait, but looking at the way the problem is written, the partial products are MAD and RAE, so perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the multiplication setup:\n\n      MAD\n    \u00d7  BE\n    -------\n       MAD      (this is E \u00d7 MAD)\n     RAE        (this is B \u00d7 MAD, shifted left by one)\n    -------\n    AMID\n\nSo, the first partial product is E \u00d7 MAD, written as MAD. So, E \u00d7 MAD must end with D as the units digit. Wait, that's because when you multiply MAD by E, the units digit is D \u00d7 E, which must give a units digit of D. So, D \u00d7 E mod 10 = D. That implies that E \u00d7 D ends with D. So, what digits E satisfy this?\n\nHmm, let's think about possible D and E values.\n\nSo, D \u00d7 E \u2261 D mod 10. That equation can be rewritten as D \u00d7 (E -1) \u2261 0 mod 10.\n\nSo, either D is 0 or E is 1, or D and (E-1) multiply to a multiple of 10.\n\nWait, if D is 0, then any E would work because 0 \u00d7 E =0, which is D. So D could be 0. Alternatively, if E is 1, then any D would satisfy D \u00d71 = D, so E could be 1. Another possibility is that D \u00d7 (E-1) is a multiple of 10. So, D could be 5 and E-1 could be 2 (so E=3), because 5\u00d72=10. Or D could be 2 and E-1=5 (so E=6), but 2\u00d75=10. Or D= 6, E-1= 5 (since 6\u00d75=30), but wait 6\u00d75=30, which is 0 mod 10. Alternatively, D=5 and E=3 (since 5\u00d72=10), which is 0 mod10.\n\nSo possibilities:\n\nCase 1: D=0, any E.\n\nCase 2: E=1, any D.\n\nCase 3: D and E-1 such that D*(E-1) is a multiple of 10.\n\nLet me note this and proceed.\n\nAlso, from the first partial product (MAD \u00d7 E = MAD), the product is MAD. Wait, no, because if you multiply MAD by E, you get a number that's MAD, but perhaps that's not the case. Wait, no, the first partial product is MAD \u00d7 E, which is written as MAD. Wait, that can't be unless E is 1, because if E is 1, then MAD \u00d71 = MAD, so the partial product is MAD. Otherwise, if E is greater than 1, the product would be a different number.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. Let me think again. The first partial product is MAD \u00d7 E, and in the multiplication setup, it's written as MAD. So, that would mean that E must be 1, because MAD \u00d7 1 = MAD. So, E is 1.\n\nWait, but what if the product is three digits? Because MAD is a three-digit number, and E is a single digit. So, if E is 1, then the product is MAD \u00d71 = MAD, which is correct. So the first partial product is MAD, and the second partial product is MAD \u00d7 B shifted left by one (so it's MAD \u00d7 B \u00d710). Then, when you add MAD and RAE (which is MAD \u00d7 B \u00d710), you get AMID.\n\nSo, E must be 1. Because if E were anything else, the first partial product would not be MAD. Wait, unless E is 1, so that's the only possibility. So, E =1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that E could be 3 if D is 5, but now, this suggests that E must be 1. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate.\n\nWait, the partial product is MAD \u00d7 E, written as MAD. So, the units digit of MAD \u00d7 E must be D. But E can't be 1 unless E is 1, but let me think: if E is 1, then the product is MAD, which fits. So that's a strong indication that E is 1.\n\nSo, E=1.\n\nSo, from this, in the first partial product, MAD \u00d7 1 = MAD, which is correct. So the first partial product is MAD, and the second is B \u00d7 MAD \u00d710, which is written as RAE, but wait, no. Wait, the second partial product is written as R A E, but shifted left by one. Wait, no, the way the multiplication is written is:\n\n      MAD\n    \u00d7  BE\n    -------\n       MAD      (E=1)\n     RAE        (B \u00d7 MAD, but shifted left by one)\n    -------\n    AMID\n\nSo, the second partial product is B \u00d7 MAD, but written shifted left by one, so it's RAE shifted left by one, which would be RA E, but I'm not sure. Wait, the second partial product is B \u00d7 MAD, which is a three-digit number, but when shifted left by one, it's a four-digit number? Or is it that when you shift a three-digit number left by one, it becomes a four-digit number if the first digit is non-zero.\n\nWait, but in the multiplication setup, the second partial product is written as RAE, but in the way it's written, it's one digit shifted left, so it's R A E, but perhaps it's actually R A E with an implied zero? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps RAE is a three-digit number, but when shifted left by one, it's a four-digit number, R A E 0? No, that doesn't fit. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second partial product is B \u00d7 MAD, which is a three-digit number, and when shifted left by one, it's a four-digit number, so perhaps the leading digit is R, and the next digits are A and E, but that would make RAE a three-digit number shifted left by one, which is a four-digit number: R A E 0? No, because when you shift left by one, you add a zero at the end, not the beginning.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: when you perform the multiplication, each partial product is written as if you're adding digits. So, for example, if MAD is 123, and BE is 45, then you multiply 123 \u00d75 =615, and 123 \u00d74=492, shifted left by one (so 4920), then add 615 +4920 =5535.\n\nIn this problem, the first partial product is MAD \u00d7 E, which is written as MAD, so E must be 1. The second partial product is MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one, written as RAE. Wait, but when you shift left by one, you add a zero at the end, but in the problem, the partial product is written as RAE, which is three digits. That suggests that MAD \u00d7 B is a three-digit number, and when shifted left by one, it's four digits, but in the problem it's written as RAE, which is three digits. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the problem is written is that the second partial product is RAE, but it's actually written as RAE shifted left by one, meaning that it's RAE0, but that would be four digits. But the way it's presented, the sum is AMID, which is four digits. So, perhaps the second partial product is a three-digit number RAE, but when shifted left, it's RAE0, making it four digits. But that doesn't make sense because the way the problem is written, the second partial product is RAE, but in the multiplication setup, it's written one line down, which would imply it's shifted left by one, so it's a four-digit number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of it as:\n\nMAD \u00d7 E = MAD (so E must be 1)\n\nMAD \u00d7 B \u00d710 = RA E (but wait, RA E is a three-digit number, but when you multiply by 10, it should be four digits. Hmm, that doesn't add up. So perhaps the second partial product is a three-digit number, but when shifted left by one, it's a four-digit number, which is RA E followed by a zero? No, that can't be, because the sum would then be MAD (three digits) plus RA E0 (four digits) = AMID (four digits). So, let me try to write the equations.\n\nLet me denote the numbers as:\n\nMAD = 100*M + 10*A + D\n\nBE = 10*B + E\n\nAMID = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D\n\nThe first partial product is MAD \u00d7 E = MAD, which is only possible if E=1.\n\nSo, E=1.\n\nThen, the second partial product is MAD \u00d7 B, but written shifted left by one, so it's (MAD \u00d7 B) \u00d710. But in the problem, this is written as RAE. Wait, RAE is a three-digit number, but (MAD \u00d7 B) \u00d710 is a four-digit number. So perhaps in the problem, the partial product is written as RAE, but actually it's RA E shifted left, so the actual value is RAE0, making it four digits.\n\nWait, but then the sum of MAD (three digits) and RAE0 (four digits) would be AMID (four digits).\n\nWait, but in the problem, the sum is:\n\n   MAD\n+ RAE0\n= AMID\n\nSo, the sum is a four-digit number.\n\nSo, let's model this.\n\nMAD \u00d71 = MAD \u2192 P1 = MAD.\n\nMAD \u00d7 B \u00d710 \u2192 P2 = (MAD \u00d7 B) \u00d710.\n\nSo, P1 + P2 = AMID.\n\nSo, MAD + (MAD \u00d7 B \u00d710) = AMID.\n\nWhich can be written as MAD \u00d7 (B \u00d710 + 1) = AMID.\n\nBut since BE is 10*B + E, which is 10*B +1, because E=1.\n\nSo, MAD \u00d7 (10*B +1) = AMID.\n\nBut AMID is a four-digit number, so MAD must be such that when multiplied by (10*B +1), it gives a four-digit number.\n\nSo, since MAD is a three-digit number, the product will be four digits only if MAD \u00d7 (10*B +1) >= 1000.\n\nSince MAD is at least 100, 10*B +1 must be at least 10 (since 100 \u00d710=1000). So B must be at least 1, but since E is 1 and letters are unique, B can't be 1, unless the problem allows it. Wait, but I assumed all letters represent unique digits, so E is 1, so B can't be 1. So B is at least 2.\n\nSo, B is between 2 and 9.\n\nSo, now, let's model the equation:\n\nMAD \u00d7 (10*B +1) = AMID.\n\nBut MAD is 100*M +10*A + D.\n\nAMID is 1000*A + 100*M +10*I + D.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n(100*M +10*A + D) \u00d7 (10*B +1) = 1000*A + 100*M +10*I + D.\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n(100M +10A + D) \u00d7 (10B +1) = (100M +10A + D)*10B + (100M +10A + D)*1.\n\nSo,\n\n= (100M \u00d710B) + (10A \u00d710B) + (D \u00d710B) + 100M +10A + D\n\n= 1000MB + 100AB + 10B D + 100M +10A + D.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n1000MB + 100AB +10B D + 100M +10A + D = 1000A + 100M +10I + D.\n\nWe can subtract D from both sides:\n\n1000MB +100AB +10B D +100M +10A = 1000A +100M +10I.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\n1000MB +100AB +10B D +100M +10A -1000A -100M -10I = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n1000MB +100AB +10B D + (100M -100M) + (10A -1000A) -10I = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n1000MB +100AB +10B D -990A -10I = 0.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I should look for some patterns or constraints.\n\nWe know E=1, so E is 1.\n\nLet's think about the first partial product, which is MAD \u00d71 = MAD. So, no issues there.\n\nNow, the second partial product is MAD \u00d7 B, which is a three-digit number, because when multiplied by 10, it's a four-digit number (RAE0). Wait, but RAE is a three-digit number. So, the second partial product is RAE, which is MAD \u00d7 B, and then shifted left by one (\u00d710), making it RAE0. So, the second partial product is (MAD \u00d7 B) \u00d710, which is RAE0.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the second partial product is written as RAE, but perhaps it's actually (MAD \u00d7 B) written as RAE, and then shifted left by one, making it RAE0. So, when you add MAD (three digits) and RAE0 (four digits), you get AMID (four digits).\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n   MAD\n+ RAE0\n= AMID\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nMAD + RAE0 = AMID.\n\nSo, let's model this.\n\nMAD is 100M +10A + D.\n\nRAE is 100R +10A + E, but E=1, so RAE is 100R +10A +1.\n\nWhen shifted left by one, it's RAE0 = (100R +10A +1) \u00d710 = 1000R +100A +10.\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n(100M +10A + D) + (1000R +100A +10) = 1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\n100M +10A + D +1000R +100A +10 = 100M + (10A +100A) + (D +10) +1000R.\n\nWhich is 100M +110A + (D +10) +1000R.\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n100M +110A + D +10 +1000R = 1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nSubtract D from both sides:\n\n100M +110A +10 +1000R = 1000A +100M +10I.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\n1000R +100M +110A +10 = 1000A +100M +10I.\n\nSubtract 100M from both sides:\n\n1000R +110A +10 = 1000A +10I.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side:\n\n1000R +110A +10 -1000A -10I =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n1000R - 890A +10 -10I =0.\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n100 R -89 A +1 - I =0.\n\nSo,\n\n100 R -89 A +1 = I.\n\nHmm, I is a single digit (0-9), so 100 R -89 A +1 must be between 0 and 9.\n\nSo,\n\n0 \u2264 100 R -89 A +1 \u22649.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n-1 \u2264 100 R -89 A \u22648.\n\nSince R and A are digits (0-9), let's see possible values.\n\nBut let's think about R and A.\n\nR is the leading digit of RAE, which is MAD \u00d7 B. So, since MAD is a three-digit number (>=100) and B is at least 2, MAD \u00d7 B is at least 200. So, RAE is a three-digit number where R is at least 2.\n\nWait, RAE is the product of MAD \u00d7 B, which is a three-digit number. So, R is the hundreds digit of that product. Since MAD is >=100 and B >=2, MAD \u00d7 B can be as low as 200 (if MAD is 100 and B is 2), so R can be 2 or higher.\n\nBut let's proceed with the equation:\n\nI =100 R -89 A +1.\n\nSince I must be between 0 and 9, let's consider possible R and A values.\n\nBut 100 R is a multiple of 100, and 89 A is a multiple of 89. So, let's see:\n\nFor I to be a digit (0-9), 100 R -89 A +1 must be between 0 and 9.\n\nSo,\n\n100 R -89 A +1 \u22650 \u2192 100 R \u226589 A -1.\n\nAnd,\n\n100 R -89 A +1 \u22649 \u2192 100 R \u226489 A +8.\n\nLet me consider possible R and A values.\n\nR can be from 2 to 9 (since RAE is a three-digit number, R can't be zero).\n\nLet's try R=2.\n\nThen,\n\n100*2 -89 A +1 \u22649 \u2192 200 -89A +1 \u22649 \u2192 201 \u226489A +9 \u2192 89A \u2265192 \u2192 A \u2265 2.157 \u2192 A \u22653.\n\nAnd,\n\n100*2 -89 A +1 \u22650 \u2192 201 -89A \u22650 \u2192 89A \u2264201 \u2192 A \u22642.258. But A must be >=3 from earlier. Contradiction. So R=2 is impossible.\n\nNext, R=3.\n\n100*3=300.\n\nSo,\n\n300 -89A +1 \u22649 \u2192 301 -89A \u22649 \u2192 89A \u2265292 \u2192 A\u2265292/89 \u22483.28, so A\u22654.\n\nAnd,\n\n301 -89A \u22650 \u2192 89A \u2264301 \u2192 A \u2264301/89 \u22483.38. So A can be 3 only.\n\nBut from above, A must be >=4. So no solution for R=3.\n\nNext, R=4.\n\n100*4=400.\n\nSo,\n\n400 -89A +1 \u22649 \u2192 401 -89A \u22649 \u2192 89A \u2265392 \u2192 A \u2265392/89 \u22484.404 \u2192 A\u22655.\n\nAnd,\n\n401 -89A \u22650 \u2192 89A \u2264401 \u2192 A \u2264401/89 \u22484.49 \u2192 A can be 4.\n\nBut from above, A must be >=5, which is a contradiction. So no solution.\n\nR=5.\n\n100*5=500.\n\nSo,\n\n500 -89A +1 \u22649 \u2192 501 -89A \u22649 \u2192 89A \u2265492 \u2192 A \u2265492/89 \u22485.528 \u2192 A\u22656.\n\nAnd,\n\n501 -89A \u22650 \u2192 89A \u2264501 \u2192 A \u22645.573 \u2192 A=5.\n\nBut A must be >=6. No solution.\n\nR=6.\n\n100*6=600.\n\nSo,\n\n600 -89A +1 \u22649 \u2192601 -89A \u22649 \u219289A \u2265592 \u2192A \u2265592/89 \u22486.651 \u2192A\u22657.\n\nAnd,\n\n601 -89A \u22650 \u219289A \u2264601 \u2192A \u2264601/89 \u22486.752 \u2192 A=6.\n\nBut from above, A must be >=7. So no solution.\n\nR=7.\n\n100*7=700.\n\nSo,\n\n700 -89A +1 \u22649 \u2192701 -89A \u22649 \u219289A \u2265692 \u2192A\u2265692/89=7.775 \u2192A\u22658.\n\nAnd,\n\n701 -89A \u22650 \u219289A \u2264701 \u2192A \u2264701/89\u22487.876 \u2192 A=7.\n\nBut A must be >=8. No solution.\n\nR=8.\n\n100*8=800.\n\nSo,\n\n800 -89A +1 \u22649 \u2192801 -89A \u22649 \u219289A \u2265792 \u2192A \u2265792/89\u22488.898 \u2192A=9.\n\nAnd,\n\n801 -89A \u22650 \u219289A \u2264801 \u2192A \u2264801/89\u22488.999 \u2192A=8 or 9.\n\nBut from first condition, A must be >=9.\n\nSo, A=9.\n\nThen, I =100*8 -89*9 +1 =800 -801 +1=0.\n\nSo I=0.\n\nSo this is a possible solution.\n\nSo R=8, A=9, I=0.\n\nLet me check if this works.\n\nSo, R=8, A=9, I=0.\n\nSo, RAE is 8 9 1 (since E=1), which is 891.\n\nSo, RAE is 891, which is the product of MAD \u00d7 B.\n\nBecause RAE = MAD \u00d7 B.\n\nSo, MAD \u00d7 B = 891.\n\nSo, MAD = 891 / B.\n\nBut MAD is a three-digit number, so 891/B must be a three-digit integer.\n\nB is a digit between 2 and 9, and since A is 9, and E is 1, B can't be 1 or 9.\n\nSo B can be 2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nLet me see which B divides 891.\n\n891 \u00f7 B must be an integer.\n\nCheck each possible B:\n\nB=2: 891/2=445.5 \u2192 no.\n\nB=3: 891 \u00f73=297 \u2192 yes. So MAD=297.\n\nCheck if letters are unique: M=2, A=9, D=7, B=3, E=1, R=8, I=0.\n\nAll unique? 2,9,7,3,1,8,0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo that's a possible solution.\n\nLet me check the multiplication.\n\nMAD=297, BE=31 (since B=3, E=1).\n\nSo, 297 \u00d731.\n\nCalculate 297 \u00d71 =297.\n\n297 \u00d730=8910.\n\nAdding them: 297 +8910=9207.\n\nSo, the product is 9207.\n\nBut the product is AMID=9207.\n\nWhich is A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo the letters would be:\n\nM=2, A=9, D=7,\n\nB=3, E=1,\n\nR=8, I=0.\n\nSo, the digits are all unique, which fits the cryptarithmetic rules.\n\nSo, the possible answer is when the digits are:\n\nA=9, M=2, D=7, B=3, E=1, R=8, I=0.\n\nLooking at the options, the options are four-digit numbers, but the question is to find the digits for A, M, D, and another digit. Wait, the question says \"decipher the following multiplication table\" and the options are four-digit numbers, like option A is 9 2 0 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the value of AMID, which is the product. In the case we just found, AMID is 9207. Looking at the options, option D is 9207.\n\nWait, no, the options are:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 9200\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u21929209\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u21929201\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u21929207\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u21929222.\n\nSo, the product is 9207, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there are no other possible solutions.\n\nLet's check R=9.\n\nWait, earlier when R=9, let's see:\n\nR=9.\n\nThen,\n\nI=100*9 -89A +1 =900 -89A +1=901 -89A.\n\nI must be between 0 and9.\n\nSo,\n\n901 -89A \u22650 \u219289A \u2264901 \u2192A \u226410.123 \u2192A can be up to 10, but A is a digit, so A\u22649.\n\nAnd,\n\n901 -89A \u22649 \u219289A \u2265892 \u2192A\u2265892/89=10.022, which is impossible since A is a digit (max 9). So R=9 is impossible.\n\nThus, the only solution is R=8, A=9, I=0, and B=3, MAD=297, BE=31, product=9207, which is option D.\n\n\nThe problem involves deciphering a multiplication table where the three-digit number **MAD** is multiplied by the two-digit number **BE**, resulting in the four-digit number **AMID**. The multiplication setup is as follows:\n\n```\n   MAD\n\u00d7   BE\n----------\n    MAD      (MAD \u00d7 E)\n  RAE        (MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one)\n----------\n  AMID\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **E = 1**: The first partial product is **MAD \u00d7 E**, which is written as **MAD**. This implies that multiplying **MAD** by **E** results in **MAD** itself, meaning **E = 1**.\n\n2. **Second Partial Product**: The second partial product is **MAD \u00d7 B**, shifted left by one, written as **RAE**. This means **MAD \u00d7 B** is a three-digit number, and when shifted left by one, it becomes **RAE0**.\n\n3. **Sum of Partial Products**: Adding the two partial products, **MAD + RAE0**, results in the four-digit number **AMID**.\n\n### Equation Setup:\nThe multiplication can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\text{MAD} \\times (10B + 1) = \\text{AMID}\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n(100M + 10A + D) \\times (10B + 1) = 1000A + 100M + 10I + D\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\\[\n1000MB + 100AB + 10BD + 100M + 10A = 1000A + 100M + 10I\n\\]\nRearranging terms:\n\\[\n1000R - 89A + 1 = I\n\\]\nHere, **I** is a single digit (0-9), so:\n\\[\n0 \\leq 100R - 89A + 1 \\leq 9\n\\]\n\n### Solving for R, A, and I:\n- **R** is the hundreds digit of **RAE**, which is the product of **MAD \u00d7 B**. Since **MAD** is a three-digit number and **B** is at least 2, **R** must be at least 2.\n- Testing possible values for **R** and **A**, the only valid solution is **R = 8**, **A = 9**, and **I = 0**. This satisfies the equation:\n\\[\nI = 100R - 89A + 1 = 100(8) - 89(9) + 1 = 800 - 801 + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Determining MAD and B:\n- From **RAE = 891**, we know **MAD \u00d7 B = 891**. Testing possible values for **B** (2-9, excluding 1 and 9), the only valid solution is **B = 3**, giving **MAD = 297**.\n\n### Verification:\n- **MAD = 297**, **BE = 31** (since **B = 3**, **E = 1**).\n- The multiplication is:\n\\[\n297 \\times 31 = 9207\n\\]\n- The product **9207** matches **AMID**, where **A = 9**, **M = 2**, **I = 0**, and **D = 7**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe digits are **A = 9**, **M = 2**, **D = 7**, **B = 3**, **E = 1**, **R = 8**, and **I = 0**. The four-digit product **AMID** is **9207**, which corresponds to option **D**.\n\n**Answer: D**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this multiplication problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on these cryptarithmetic puzzles, but I remember each letter represents a unique digit, right?\n\nThe problem is set up like a multiplication table. The top row is M A D, and the bottom row is B E. When multiplied, they give a three-digit result M A D and a two-digit result R A E. Then, adding them together gives a four-digit number A M I D.\n\nHmm, wait, let me visualize it:\n\n   M A D\n\u00d7   B E\n---------\n   M A D  (this must be MAD \u00d7 E)\nR A E      (this must be MAD \u00d7 B, shifted one position to the left)\n---------\nA M I D\n\nSo, the multiplication is done in two steps, each multiplied by E and B respectively, then summed.\n\nLet me think about the structure. The first partial product is MAD multiplied by E, giving MAD again. That suggests that when you multiply MAD by E, you get MAD. So, MAD \u00d7 E = MAD. That can only happen if E is 1, because any number multiplied by 1 remains the same. Wait, but E is a digit, so E=1? Let me check.\n\nWait, but wait. If E is 1, then MAD \u00d7 1 = MAD, which is correct. So E must be 1. That's a start.\n\nSo, E=1.\n\nNow, the second partial product is R A E, which is MAD \u00d7 B shifted one position. So that's MAD \u00d7 B \u00d7 10. So when you add MAD (from the first partial product) and MAD \u00d7 B \u00d7 10, you get A M I D.\n\nLet me write this as an equation. Let me denote MAD as a three-digit number: 100*M + 10*A + D. Similarly, BE is a two-digit number: 10*B + E. But since E is 1, BE is 10*B +1.\n\nThe multiplication would be:\n\n(100*M + 10*A + D) \u00d7 (10*B + 1) = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D\n\nWait, but wait, actually, the sum of the partial products is the four-digit number. Let me think again.\n\nThe first partial product is (MAD) \u00d7 E = MAD. The second partial product is (MAD \u00d7 B) shifted left by one digit, so it's (MAD \u00d7 B) \u00d7 10. The sum of these two is the four-digit number A M I D.\n\nSo, equation:\n\nMAD \u00d7 E + (MAD \u00d7 B) \u00d7 10 = A M I D.\n\nBut since E=1, that's:\n\nMAD \u00d7 1 + (MAD \u00d7 B) \u00d710 = A M I D.\n\nFactor out MAD:\n\nMAD \u00d7 (1 + 10*B) = A M I D.\n\nNow, the right-hand side is a four-digit number. Let me represent MAD as N, a three-digit number. So N \u00d7 (1 + 10*B) = a four-digit number starting with A. Since N is three digits, 100 \u2264 N \u2264 999.\n\nSo, N \u00d7 (1 + 10*B) must be between 1000 and 9999. Let me compute the possible ranges.\n\nSince N is at least 100 and (1 + 10*B) is at least 1 (if B=0, but B can't be zero because it's the leading digit of a two-digit number BE). Wait, BE is a two-digit number, so B can't be zero. So B is from 1 to 9. So 1 + 10*B ranges from 11 to 91.\n\nSo, N \u00d7 (11 to 91) must be a four-digit number. Let's see the minimum N for that. The smallest product is 100 \u00d7 11 = 1100, which is four digits. The largest N is 999 \u00d791= 90909, which is five digits, but since our product is four digits, N \u00d7 (1 +10*B) must be \u2264 9999.\n\nSo, 100 \u00d7 11 = 1100, 999 \u00d7 11 = 10989 which is five digits. So B can't be larger than a value where N \u00d7 (1+10*B) \u22649999.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think about what A is. Because the four-digit product starts with A. So the first digit of the product is A, which is the same as the first digit of N (since N is MAD, M is the first digit). Wait, let me see: the product is A M I D. So the thousands digit is A, hundreds is M, tens I, units D.\n\nHmm, but N is MAD, so M is the hundreds digit, A is tens, D units. So when you multiply N by (1+10*B), the result is A M I D. Wait, that's interesting. So the product's thousands digit is A, which is the tens digit of N. Hmm.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think with some examples. Suppose N is 123, and (1+10*B) is, say, 11. Then 123 \u00d711= 1353. So the product is 1353, which starts with 1, which is the same as A in N (since N is 123, A is 2). Wait, no. Wait, in this example, N is 123, so M=1, A=2, D=3. The product is 1353, which starts with 1 (thousands digit) which is M, not A. But in the problem, the product starts with A.\n\nWait, that suggests that in the problem, the product is A M I D, which starts with A. But N starts with M. So, for N \u00d7 (something) to start with A, which is the tens digit of N, that's a clue. So the product is four digits, and the first digit is A. So, for N=100*M +10*A + D, when multiplied by (1+10*B), the result is 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can think about the possible values of B.\n\nSince B is from 1 to 9, let's consider the possible (1+10*B) values:\n\nB=1: 11\nB=2:21\nB=3:31\nB=4:41\nB=5:51\nB=6:61\nB=7:71\nB=8:81\nB=9:91\n\nSo, for each possible B, I can try to see if N \u00d7 (1+10*B) = A M I D, where A is the tens digit of N, and M is the hundreds digit.\n\nWait, but N is MAD, so N = 100*M +10*A + D.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n(100*M + 10*A + D) \u00d7 (1 + 10*B) = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\nN \u00d7 (1 +10B) = 1000*A + 100*M + 10I + D.\n\nBut since N is 100M +10A + D, perhaps I can write:\n\n(100M +10A + D) * (1 +10B) = 1000A + 100M + 10I + D.\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n(100M)(1) + (100M)(10B) + (10A)(1) + (10A)(10B) + D(1) + D(10B)\n\nWhich is:\n\n100M + 1000MB + 10A + 100AB + D + 10BD.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= 100M (1 + 10B) + 10A (1 + 10B) + D(1 + 10B).\n\nWait, that's N \u00d7 (1 +10B) as expected.\n\nBut the right side is 1000A + 100M + 10I + D.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor this differently. Let me group terms by their digits.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the multiplication and the carry-over digits.\n\nLet me consider the multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, the multiplication of MAD by E=1 gives MAD. So, the first partial product is MAD.\n\nThen, the multiplication of MAD by B gives R A E. But since E=1, the partial product is R A 1. But wait, R A E is the second partial product, which is shifted left by one (since it's multiplied by B in the tens place). So, when you add MAD (units place) and R A E shifted left by one (tens place), you get the four-digit number A M I D.\n\nWait, let me write the addition:\n\n      M A D\n    + R A E \u00d710\n    -----------\n      A M I D\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nMAD + (R A E \u00d7 10) = A M I D.\n\nBut R A E is the result of MAD \u00d7 B. So, R A E = MAD \u00d7 B.\n\nBut R A E is a three-digit number, so MAD \u00d7 B must be a three-digit number. That gives us:\n\n(100M +10A + D) \u00d7 B = 100R +10A + E.\n\nBut E=1, so:\n\n(100M +10A + D) \u00d7 B = 100R +10A +1.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit complicated. Let me see if I can find any constraints from this.\n\nSince E=1, and in the second partial product, R A E is the result of MAD \u00d7 B. So, when you multiply MAD by B, the units digit is E=1. So, (D \u00d7 B) must end with 1. Because D is the units digit of MAD, and when multiplied by B, the units digit is 1.\n\nSo, D \u00d7 B mod 10 = 1.\n\nWhat digits D and B satisfy this condition?\n\nPossible options:\n\nB=1 \u2192 D \u00d71 mod10=1 \u2192 D=1.\n\nBut if B=1, then E=1 and B=1, so E and B would be the same digit, which is not allowed because each letter represents a unique digit. So B can't be 1.\n\nNext, B=3 \u2192 D \u00d73 mod10=1 \u2192 D must be 7, since 7\u00d73=21 \u2192 mod10=1.\n\nB=7 \u2192 D \u00d77 mod10=1 \u2192 D=3, because 3\u00d77=21 \u2192 mod10=1.\n\nB=9 \u2192 D \u00d79 mod10=1 \u2192 D=9, but then 9\u00d79=81, which ends with 1. But D=9, and E=1, which is possible.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's list all possibilities where D \u00d7 B ends with 1.\n\nPossible (B, D) pairs:\n\n- B=3, D=7 \u2192 3\u00d77=21 \u2192 1\n- B=7, D=3 \u21927\u00d73=21 \u21921\n- B=9, D=9 \u21929\u00d79=81 \u21921.\n\nBut wait, D and B must be unique digits, and E is already 1. So let's check each possibility.\n\n1. B=3, D=7: Is this possible? Let's see. B=3, D=7.\n\nThen, in the second partial product, R A E is MAD \u00d7 B, which is 3\u00d7MAD. So 3 \u00d7 (100M +10A +7) = 100R +10A +1.\n\nWait, let me compute 3 \u00d7 MAD: 3\u00d7(100M +10A +7) = 300M +30A +21.\n\nThis must equal 100R +10A +1. So:\n\n300M +30A +21 = 100R +10A +1.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n300M +30A +21 -100R -10A -1 =0 \u2192 300M +20A +20 -100R =0.\n\nDivide both sides by 20:\n\n15M + A +1 -5R = 0 \u2192 15M + A +1 =5R.\n\nSince R is a digit (0-9), 5R can be 0 to 45.\n\n15M is at least 15\u00d71=15 (since M is a digit from 1-9). So 15M + A +1 =5R.\n\nBut 5R can't be larger than 45, so 15M + A +1 \u226445 \u2192 15M \u226444 \u2192 M \u22642. Because 15\u00d73=45, which would make 15M + A +1 \u226546, which is larger than 45.\n\nSo M can be 1 or 2.\n\nLet's consider M=1.\n\nThen, 15(1) + A +1 =5R \u2192 16 +A =5R.\n\nSince A is a digit (0-9), 16+A must be divisible by 5. Let's see possible A values.\n\n16 + A must be a multiple of 5. So 16 mod5=1, so A mod5 must be 4 to make 16+A mod5=0.\n\nSo A can be 4 or 9.\n\nBut E=1, B=3, D=7. So A can't be 1,3,7.\n\nIf A=4:\n\n16+4=20 \u21925R=20 \u2192 R=4.\n\nBut then R=4, which is okay as long as 4 isn't used elsewhere yet.\n\nSo, check if R=4 is possible. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, check the multiplication 3\u00d7MAD = R A E.\n\nMAD is 1 4 7 \u2192 147.\n\n3 \u00d7147 = 441.\n\nSo R A E is 441. So R=4, A=4, E=1.\n\nBut wait, A=4, so in R A E, A is 4. So R is 4, E=1. So the partial product is 441.\n\nBut in this case, A is 4, which is correct. But wait, in the initial setup, the partial product R A E is 441, which would imply R=4, A=4, E=1. But A is 4, and R is 4. That's a problem because each letter must represent a unique digit. So R and A can't both be 4. So this is invalid.\n\nSo this possibility is out.\n\nNext, A=9.\n\n16 +9=25 \u21925R=25 \u2192 R=5.\n\nSo R=5, A=9.\n\nCheck if 3\u00d7MAD = R A E.\n\nMAD is 1 9 7 \u2192 197.\n\n3\u00d7197 = 591.\n\nSo R A E is 5 9 1. So R=5, A=9, E=1.\n\nSo R=5, which is new, and A=9. E=1 is already known.\n\nSo this works. Let me check for uniqueness so far: M=1, A=9, D=7, B=3, E=1, R=5. So all are unique except E is 1, but E is 1, which is allowed as long as no other letters are 1. Wait, E is 1, and B is 3, so others can't be 1. Wait, no, E is 1, so none of the other letters can be 1.\n\nWait, in this case, M=1. Wait, that's a problem because M is 1, and E is 1. So two letters (M and E) would be 1, which is not allowed since each letter must be unique. So this case is invalid.\n\nSo M can't be 1 in this scenario.\n\nNow, let's try M=2.\n\nThen, 15(2) +A +1=5R \u219230 +A +1=31 +A =5R.\n\n31 +A must be a multiple of 5. 31 mod5=1, so A must be 4 or 9 to make 31+A mod5=0.\n\nSo possible A=4 or 9.\n\nLet's try A=4.\n\n31+4=35 \u21925R=35 \u2192 R=7.\n\nSo R=7.\n\nNow, check if 3\u00d7MAD = R A E.\n\nMAD is 2 4 7 \u2192 247.\n\n3\u00d7247=741.\n\nSo R A E is 7 4 1. So R=7, A=4, E=1. That's correct. Now, check for uniqueness: M=2, A=4, D=7, B=3, E=1, R=7.\n\nWait, R is 7 and D is 7. That's a conflict because R and D would both be 7. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo this is invalid.\n\nNext, A=9.\n\n31+9=40 \u21925R=40 \u2192 R=8.\n\nSo R=8.\n\nCheck 3\u00d7MAD = R A E.\n\nMAD is 2 9 7 \u2192 297.\n\n3\u00d7297=891.\n\nSo R A E is 8 9 1. R=8, A=9, E=1. All unique so far. M=2, A=9, D=7, B=3, E=1, R=8.\n\nNo duplicates yet.\n\nNow, let's proceed to the overall multiplication.\n\nThe total is MAD + (R A E \u00d710) = A M I D.\n\nSo, MAD is 297.\n\nR A E is 891, so 891 \u00d710 =8910.\n\nAdding MAD (297) to that: 8910 +297 = 9207.\n\nSo the sum is 9207, which should be A M I D.\n\nA M I D is 9 2 I 7.\n\nSo 9207 \u2192 thousands digit 9, hundreds 2, tens 0, units 7.\n\nSo A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7.\n\nSo the four-digit number is 9207, which fits A M I D as 9 2 0 7.\n\nNow, let's check if all digits are unique and correct.\n\nLetters used so far:\n\nM=2\n\nA=9\n\nD=7\n\nB=3\n\nE=1\n\nR=8\n\nI=0\n\nSo, all are unique. Let's check if any other constraints are violated.\n\nNow, let's look at the addition step:\n\nMAD (297) + RAE \u00d710 (8910) = 297 +8910 =9207.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the four-digit product is 9207, which is A M I D \u21929 2 0 7.\n\nSo the digits are:\n\nA=9\n\nM=2\n\nI=0\n\nD=7\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again. When we multiply MAD (297) by BE (31), what do we get?\n\n297 \u00d731.\n\nLet me compute 297 \u00d730=8910, plus 297\u00d71=297. Sum is 8910+297=9207.\n\nWhich matches the four-digit product. So this seems correct.\n\nNow, let's look at the options given.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 D=0, but in our case D=7. So no.\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 D=9, but D=7. No.\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 D=1, but D=7. No.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7. Correct.\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 D=2, which is M's value. Conflict.\n\nSo the correct option is D)9 2 0 7.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the cryptarithmetic puzzle, we analyze the given multiplication table:\n\n```\n   M A D\n\u00d7   B E\n---------\n   M A D  (MAD \u00d7 E)\nR A E      (MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one)\n---------\nA M I D\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **E = 1**: The first partial product is `MAD \u00d7 E = MAD`, which implies that `E = 1` because any number multiplied by 1 remains unchanged.\n2. **Structure of the Second Partial Product**: The second partial product is `R A E = MAD \u00d7 B`, shifted left by one digit. This means `MAD \u00d7 B` must be a three-digit number ending in `E = 1`.\n3. **Multiplication Constraint**: From `D \u00d7 B \u2261 1 (mod 10)`, the possible pairs `(B, D)` are:\n   - `(3, 7)` because `3 \u00d7 7 = 21`.\n   - `(7, 3)` because `7 \u00d7 3 = 21`.\n   - `(9, 9)` because `9 \u00d7 9 = 81`.\n   However, `B` and `D` must be unique digits, and `E = 1` is already used, so `(9, 9)` is invalid. Thus, the valid pairs are `(B, D) = (3, 7)` or `(7, 3)`.\n\n### Case Analysis:\n#### Case 1: `(B, D) = (3, 7)`\n- The second partial product is `R A E = MAD \u00d7 B = MAD \u00d7 3`. Expanding:\n  \\[\n  (100M + 10A + 7) \u00d7 3 = 100R + 10A + 1\n  \\]\n  Simplifying:\n  \\[\n  300M + 30A + 21 = 100R + 10A + 1\n  \\]\n  Rearranging:\n  \\[\n  300M + 20A + 20 = 100R\n  \\]\n  Dividing by 20:\n  \\[\n  15M + A + 1 = 5R\n  \\]\n  Since `R` is a digit (0-9), `15M + A + 1` must be divisible by 5. Testing possible values:\n  - If `M = 1`, `15(1) + A + 1 = 16 + A` must be divisible by 5. Possible `A = 4` or `A = 9`.\n    - For `A = 4`, `R = (16 + 4) / 5 = 4`. However, this makes `A = 4` and `R = 4`, which is invalid since all letters must represent unique digits.\n    - For `A = 9`, `R = (16 + 9) / 5 = 5`. This gives `R = 5`. Checking `MAD = 197` and `3 \u00d7 197 = 591`, which matches `R A E = 591`. However, `M = 1` and `E = 1` conflict, so this is invalid.\n  - If `M = 2`, `15(2) + A + 1 = 31 + A` must be divisible by 5. Possible `A = 4` or `A = 9`.\n    - For `A = 4`, `R = (31 + 4) / 5 = 7`. Checking `MAD = 247` and `3 \u00d7 247 = 741`, which matches `R A E = 741`. However, `D = 7` and `R = 7` conflict, so this is invalid.\n    - For `A = 9`, `R = (31 + 9) / 5 = 8`. Checking `MAD = 297` and `3 \u00d7 297 = 891`, which matches `R A E = 891`. This is valid so far.\n\n#### Final Check:\n- Adding the partial products:\n  \\[\n  MAD + (R A E \u00d7 10) = 297 + (891 \u00d7 10) = 297 + 8910 = 9207\n  \\]\n  The result is `A M I D = 9207`, which matches `A = 9`, `M = 2`, `I = 0`, and `D = 7`.\n\n### Verification of Uniqueness:\n- Letters and their corresponding digits:\n  - `M = 2`\n  - `A = 9`\n  - `D = 7`\n  - `B = 3`\n  - `E = 1`\n  - `R = 8`\n  - `I = 0`\n- All digits are unique, satisfying the constraints.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct mapping is `A = 9`, `M = 2`, `I = 0`, and `D = 7`, which corresponds to option **D)9 2 0 7**.\n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this multiplication problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on these cryptarithmetic puzzles, but I remember each letter represents a unique digit, right?\n\nThe problem is set up like a multiplication table. The top row is M A D, and the bottom row is B E. When multiplied, they give a three-digit result M A D and a two-digit result R A E. Then, adding them together gives a four-digit number A M I D.\n\nHmm, wait, let me visualize it:\n\n   M A D\n\u00d7   B E\n---------\n   M A D  (this must be MAD \u00d7 E)\nR A E      (this must be MAD \u00d7 B, shifted one position to the left)\n---------\nA M I D\n\nSo, the multiplication is done in two steps, each multiplied by E and B respectively, then summed.\n\nLet me think about the structure. The first partial product is MAD multiplied by E, giving MAD again. That suggests that when you multiply MAD by E, you get MAD. So, MAD \u00d7 E = MAD. That can only happen if E is 1, because any number multiplied by 1 remains the same. Wait, but E is a digit, so E=1? Let me check.\n\nWait, but wait. If E is 1, then MAD \u00d7 1 = MAD, which is correct. So E must be 1. That's a start.\n\nSo, E=1.\n\nNow, the second partial product is R A E, which is MAD \u00d7 B shifted one position. So that's MAD \u00d7 B \u00d7 10. So when you add MAD (from the first partial product) and MAD \u00d7 B \u00d7 10, you get A M I D.\n\nLet me write this as an equation. Let me denote MAD as a three-digit number: 100*M + 10*A + D. Similarly, BE is a two-digit number: 10*B + E. But since E is 1, BE is 10*B +1.\n\nThe multiplication would be:\n\n(100*M + 10*A + D) \u00d7 (10*B + 1) = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D\n\nWait, but wait, actually, the sum of the partial products is the four-digit number. Let me think again.\n\nThe first partial product is (MAD) \u00d7 E = MAD. The second partial product is (MAD \u00d7 B) shifted left by one digit, so it's (MAD \u00d7 B) \u00d7 10. The sum of these two is the four-digit number A M I D.\n\nSo, equation:\n\nMAD \u00d7 E + (MAD \u00d7 B) \u00d7 10 = A M I D.\n\nBut since E=1, that's:\n\nMAD \u00d7 1 + (MAD \u00d7 B) \u00d710 = A M I D.\n\nFactor out MAD:\n\nMAD \u00d7 (1 + 10*B) = A M I D.\n\nNow, the right-hand side is a four-digit number. Let me represent MAD as N, a three-digit number. So N \u00d7 (1 + 10*B) = a four-digit number starting with A. Since N is three digits, 100 \u2264 N \u2264 999.\n\nSo, N \u00d7 (1 + 10*B) must be between 1000 and 9999. Let me compute the possible ranges.\n\nSince N is at least 100 and (1 + 10*B) is at least 1 (if B=0, but B can't be zero because it's the leading digit of a two-digit number BE). Wait, BE is a two-digit number, so B can't be zero. So B is from 1 to 9. So 1 + 10*B ranges from 11 to 91.\n\nSo, N \u00d7 (11 to 91) must be a four-digit number. Let's see the minimum N for that. The smallest product is 100 \u00d7 11 = 1100, which is four digits. The largest N is 999 \u00d791= 90909, which is five digits, but since our product is four digits, N \u00d7 (1 +10*B) must be \u2264 9999.\n\nSo, 100 \u00d7 11 = 1100, 999 \u00d7 11 = 10989 which is five digits. So B can't be larger than a value where N \u00d7 (1+10*B) \u22649999.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think about what A is. Because the four-digit product starts with A. So the first digit of the product is A, which is the same as the first digit of N (since N is MAD, M is the first digit). Wait, let me see: the product is A M I D. So the thousands digit is A, hundreds is M, tens I, units D.\n\nHmm, but N is MAD, so M is the hundreds digit, A is tens, D units. So when you multiply N by (1+10*B), the result is A M I D. Wait, that's interesting. So the product's thousands digit is A, which is the tens digit of N. Hmm.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think with some examples. Suppose N is 123, and (1+10*B) is, say, 11. Then 123 \u00d711= 1353. So the product is 1353, which starts with 1, which is the same as A in N (since N is 123, A is 2). Wait, no. Wait, in this example, N is 123, so M=1, A=2, D=3. The product is 1353, which starts with 1 (thousands digit) which is M, not A. But in the problem, the product starts with A.\n\nWait, that suggests that in the problem, the product is A M I D, which starts with A. But N starts with M. So, for N \u00d7 (something) to start with A, which is the tens digit of N, that's a clue. So the product is four digits, and the first digit is A. So, for N=100*M +10*A + D, when multiplied by (1+10*B), the result is 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can think about the possible values of B.\n\nSince B is from 1 to 9, let's consider the possible (1+10*B) values:\n\nB=1: 11\nB=2:21\nB=3:31\nB=4:41\nB=5:51\nB=6:61\nB=7:71\nB=8:81\nB=9:91\n\nSo, for each possible B, I can try to see if N \u00d7 (1+10*B) = A M I D, where A is the tens digit of N, and M is the hundreds digit.\n\nWait, but N is MAD, so N = 100*M +10*A + D.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n(100*M + 10*A + D) \u00d7 (1 + 10*B) = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\nN \u00d7 (1 +10B) = 1000*A + 100*M + 10I + D.\n\nBut since N is 100M +10A + D, perhaps I can write:\n\n(100M +10A + D) * (1 +10B) = 1000A + 100M + 10I + D.\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n(100M)(1) + (100M)(10B) + (10A)(1) + (10A)(10B) + D(1) + D(10B)\n\nWhich is:\n\n100M + 1000MB + 10A + 100AB + D + 10BD.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= 100M (1 + 10B) + 10A (1 + 10B) + D(1 + 10B).\n\nWait, that's N \u00d7 (1 +10B) as expected.\n\nBut the right side is 1000A + 100M + 10I + D.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor this differently. Let me group terms by their digits.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the multiplication and the carry-over digits.\n\nLet me consider the multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, the multiplication of MAD by E=1 gives MAD. So, the first partial product is MAD.\n\nThen, the multiplication of MAD by B gives R A E. But since E=1, the partial product is R A 1. But wait, R A E is the second partial product, which is shifted left by one (since it's multiplied by B in the tens place). So, when you add MAD (units place) and R A E shifted left by one (tens place), you get the four-digit number A M I D.\n\nWait, let me write the addition:\n\n      M A D\n    + R A E \u00d710\n    -----------\n      A M I D\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nMAD + (R A E \u00d7 10) = A M I D.\n\nBut R A E is the result of MAD \u00d7 B. So, R A E = MAD \u00d7 B.\n\nBut R A E is a three-digit number, so MAD \u00d7 B must be a three-digit number. That gives us:\n\n(100M +10A + D) \u00d7 B = 100R +10A + E.\n\nBut E=1, so:\n\n(100M +10A + D) \u00d7 B = 100R +10A +1.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit complicated. Let me see if I can find any constraints from this.\n\nSince E=1, and in the second partial product, R A E is the result of MAD \u00d7 B. So, when you multiply MAD by B, the units digit is E=1. So, (D \u00d7 B) must end with 1. Because D is the units digit of MAD, and when multiplied by B, the units digit is 1.\n\nSo, D \u00d7 B mod 10 = 1.\n\nWhat digits D and B satisfy this condition?\n\nPossible options:\n\nB=1 \u2192 D \u00d71 mod10=1 \u2192 D=1.\n\nBut if B=1, then E=1 and B=1, so E and B would be the same digit, which is not allowed because each letter represents a unique digit. So B can't be 1.\n\nNext, B=3 \u2192 D \u00d73 mod10=1 \u2192 D must be 7, since 7\u00d73=21 \u2192 mod10=1.\n\nB=7 \u2192 D \u00d77 mod10=1 \u2192 D=3, because 3\u00d77=21 \u2192 mod10=1.\n\nB=9 \u2192 D \u00d79 mod10=1 \u2192 D=9, but then 9\u00d79=81, which ends with 1. But D=9, and E=1, which is possible.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's list all possibilities where D \u00d7 B ends with 1.\n\nPossible (B, D) pairs:\n\n- B=3, D=7 \u2192 3\u00d77=21 \u2192 1\n- B=7, D=3 \u21927\u00d73=21 \u21921\n- B=9, D=9 \u21929\u00d79=81 \u21921.\n\nBut wait, D and B must be unique digits, and E is already 1. So let's check each possibility.\n\n1. B=3, D=7: Is this possible? Let's see. B=3, D=7.\n\nThen, in the second partial product, R A E is MAD \u00d7 B, which is 3\u00d7MAD. So 3 \u00d7 (100M +10A +7) = 100R +10A +1.\n\nWait, let me compute 3 \u00d7 MAD: 3\u00d7(100M +10A +7) = 300M +30A +21.\n\nThis must equal 100R +10A +1. So:\n\n300M +30A +21 = 100R +10A +1.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n300M +30A +21 -100R -10A -1 =0 \u2192 300M +20A +20 -100R =0.\n\nDivide both sides by 20:\n\n15M + A +1 -5R = 0 \u2192 15M + A +1 =5R.\n\nSince R is a digit (0-9), 5R can be 0 to 45.\n\n15M is at least 15\u00d71=15 (since M is a digit from 1-9). So 15M + A +1 =5R.\n\nBut 5R can't be larger than 45, so 15M + A +1 \u226445 \u2192 15M \u226444 \u2192 M \u22642. Because 15\u00d73=45, which would make 15M + A +1 \u226546, which is larger than 45.\n\nSo M can be 1 or 2.\n\nLet's consider M=1.\n\nThen, 15(1) + A +1 =5R \u2192 16 +A =5R.\n\nSince A is a digit (0-9), 16+A must be divisible by 5. Let's see possible A values.\n\n16 + A must be a multiple of 5. So 16 mod5=1, so A mod5 must be 4 to make 16+A mod5=0.\n\nSo A can be 4 or 9.\n\nBut E=1, B=3, D=7. So A can't be 1,3,7.\n\nIf A=4:\n\n16+4=20 \u21925R=20 \u2192 R=4.\n\nBut then R=4, which is okay as long as 4 isn't used elsewhere yet.\n\nSo, check if R=4 is possible. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, check the multiplication 3\u00d7MAD = R A E.\n\nMAD is 1 4 7 \u2192 147.\n\n3 \u00d7147 = 441.\n\nSo R A E is 441. So R=4, A=4, E=1.\n\nBut wait, A=4, so in R A E, A is 4. So R is 4, E=1. So the partial product is 441.\n\nBut in this case, A is 4, which is correct. But wait, in the initial setup, the partial product R A E is 441, which would imply R=4, A=4, E=1. But A is 4, and R is 4. That's a problem because each letter must represent a unique digit. So R and A can't both be 4. So this is invalid.\n\nSo this possibility is out.\n\nNext, A=9.\n\n16 +9=25 \u21925R=25 \u2192 R=5.\n\nSo R=5, A=9.\n\nCheck if 3\u00d7MAD = R A E.\n\nMAD is 1 9 7 \u2192 197.\n\n3\u00d7197 = 591.\n\nSo R A E is 5 9 1. So R=5, A=9, E=1.\n\nSo R=5, which is new, and A=9. E=1 is already known.\n\nSo this works. Let me check for uniqueness so far: M=1, A=9, D=7, B=3, E=1, R=5. So all are unique except E is 1, but E is 1, which is allowed as long as no other letters are 1. Wait, E is 1, and B is 3, so others can't be 1. Wait, no, E is 1, so none of the other letters can be 1.\n\nWait, in this case, M=1. Wait, that's a problem because M is 1, and E is 1. So two letters (M and E) would be 1, which is not allowed since each letter must be unique. So this case is invalid.\n\nSo M can't be 1 in this scenario.\n\nNow, let's try M=2.\n\nThen, 15(2) +A +1=5R \u219230 +A +1=31 +A =5R.\n\n31 +A must be a multiple of 5. 31 mod5=1, so A must be 4 or 9 to make 31+A mod5=0.\n\nSo possible A=4 or 9.\n\nLet's try A=4.\n\n31+4=35 \u21925R=35 \u2192 R=7.\n\nSo R=7.\n\nNow, check if 3\u00d7MAD = R A E.\n\nMAD is 2 4 7 \u2192 247.\n\n3\u00d7247=741.\n\nSo R A E is 7 4 1. So R=7, A=4, E=1. That's correct. Now, check for uniqueness: M=2, A=4, D=7, B=3, E=1, R=7.\n\nWait, R is 7 and D is 7. That's a conflict because R and D would both be 7. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo this is invalid.\n\nNext, A=9.\n\n31+9=40 \u21925R=40 \u2192 R=8.\n\nSo R=8.\n\nCheck 3\u00d7MAD = R A E.\n\nMAD is 2 9 7 \u2192 297.\n\n3\u00d7297=891.\n\nSo R A E is 8 9 1. R=8, A=9, E=1. All unique so far. M=2, A=9, D=7, B=3, E=1, R=8.\n\nNo duplicates yet.\n\nNow, let's proceed to the overall multiplication.\n\nThe total is MAD + (R A E \u00d710) = A M I D.\n\nSo, MAD is 297.\n\nR A E is 891, so 891 \u00d710 =8910.\n\nAdding MAD (297) to that: 8910 +297 = 9207.\n\nSo the sum is 9207, which should be A M I D.\n\nA M I D is 9 2 I 7.\n\nSo 9207 \u2192 thousands digit 9, hundreds 2, tens 0, units 7.\n\nSo A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7.\n\nSo the four-digit number is 9207, which fits A M I D as 9 2 0 7.\n\nNow, let's check if all digits are unique and correct.\n\nLetters used so far:\n\nM=2\n\nA=9\n\nD=7\n\nB=3\n\nE=1\n\nR=8\n\nI=0\n\nSo, all are unique. Let's check if any other constraints are violated.\n\nNow, let's look at the addition step:\n\nMAD (297) + RAE \u00d710 (8910) = 297 +8910 =9207.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the four-digit product is 9207, which is A M I D \u21929 2 0 7.\n\nSo the digits are:\n\nA=9\n\nM=2\n\nI=0\n\nD=7\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again. When we multiply MAD (297) by BE (31), what do we get?\n\n297 \u00d731.\n\nLet me compute 297 \u00d730=8910, plus 297\u00d71=297. Sum is 8910+297=9207.\n\nWhich matches the four-digit product. So this seems correct.\n\nNow, let's look at the options given.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 D=0, but in our case D=7. So no.\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 D=9, but D=7. No.\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 D=1, but D=7. No.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7. Correct.\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 D=2, which is M's value. Conflict.\n\nSo the correct option is D)9 2 0 7.\n\n\nTo solve the cryptarithmetic puzzle, we analyze the given multiplication table:\n\n```\n   M A D\n\u00d7   B E\n---------\n   M A D  (MAD \u00d7 E)\nR A E      (MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one)\n---------\nA M I D\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **E = 1**: The first partial product is `MAD \u00d7 E = MAD`, which implies that `E = 1` because any number multiplied by 1 remains unchanged.\n2. **Structure of the Second Partial Product**: The second partial product is `R A E = MAD \u00d7 B`, shifted left by one digit. This means `MAD \u00d7 B` must be a three-digit number ending in `E = 1`.\n3. **Multiplication Constraint**: From `D \u00d7 B \u2261 1 (mod 10)`, the possible pairs `(B, D)` are:\n   - `(3, 7)` because `3 \u00d7 7 = 21`.\n   - `(7, 3)` because `7 \u00d7 3 = 21`.\n   - `(9, 9)` because `9 \u00d7 9 = 81`.\n   However, `B` and `D` must be unique digits, and `E = 1` is already used, so `(9, 9)` is invalid. Thus, the valid pairs are `(B, D) = (3, 7)` or `(7, 3)`.\n\n### Case Analysis:\n#### Case 1: `(B, D) = (3, 7)`\n- The second partial product is `R A E = MAD \u00d7 B = MAD \u00d7 3`. Expanding:\n  \\[\n  (100M + 10A + 7) \u00d7 3 = 100R + 10A + 1\n  \\]\n  Simplifying:\n  \\[\n  300M + 30A + 21 = 100R + 10A + 1\n  \\]\n  Rearranging:\n  \\[\n  300M + 20A + 20 = 100R\n  \\]\n  Dividing by 20:\n  \\[\n  15M + A + 1 = 5R\n  \\]\n  Since `R` is a digit (0-9), `15M + A + 1` must be divisible by 5. Testing possible values:\n  - If `M = 1`, `15(1) + A + 1 = 16 + A` must be divisible by 5. Possible `A = 4` or `A = 9`.\n    - For `A = 4`, `R = (16 + 4) / 5 = 4`. However, this makes `A = 4` and `R = 4`, which is invalid since all letters must represent unique digits.\n    - For `A = 9`, `R = (16 + 9) / 5 = 5`. This gives `R = 5`. Checking `MAD = 197` and `3 \u00d7 197 = 591`, which matches `R A E = 591`. However, `M = 1` and `E = 1` conflict, so this is invalid.\n  - If `M = 2`, `15(2) + A + 1 = 31 + A` must be divisible by 5. Possible `A = 4` or `A = 9`.\n    - For `A = 4`, `R = (31 + 4) / 5 = 7`. Checking `MAD = 247` and `3 \u00d7 247 = 741`, which matches `R A E = 741`. However, `D = 7` and `R = 7` conflict, so this is invalid.\n    - For `A = 9`, `R = (31 + 9) / 5 = 8`. Checking `MAD = 297` and `3 \u00d7 297 = 891`, which matches `R A E = 891`. This is valid so far.\n\n#### Final Check:\n- Adding the partial products:\n  \\[\n  MAD + (R A E \u00d7 10) = 297 + (891 \u00d7 10) = 297 + 8910 = 9207\n  \\]\n  The result is `A M I D = 9207`, which matches `A = 9`, `M = 2`, `I = 0`, and `D = 7`.\n\n### Verification of Uniqueness:\n- Letters and their corresponding digits:\n  - `M = 2`\n  - `A = 9`\n  - `D = 7`\n  - `B = 3`\n  - `E = 1`\n  - `R = 8`\n  - `I = 0`\n- All digits are unique, satisfying the constraints.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct mapping is `A = 9`, `M = 2`, `I = 0`, and `D = 7`, which corresponds to option **D)9 2 0 7**.\n\nAnswer: D",
