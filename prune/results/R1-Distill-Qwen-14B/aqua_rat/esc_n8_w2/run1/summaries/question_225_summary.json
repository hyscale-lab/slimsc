      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a rectangular parking space. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand. \n\nThe question says that a rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. Oh wait, so three sides are painted, and one is not. The unpainted side has a length of 9 feet. Also, the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. They're asking for the area of the parking space in square feet. The options are A)46, B)81, C)126, D)252, E)None.\n\nAlright, let me think about how to approach this. So, since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal in length. The rectangle has two lengths and two widths. But one side isn't painted. Let me visualize it. Maybe the rectangle is being painted on the front, left, and right sides, leaving the back unpainted. Or perhaps the opposite\u2014maybe the top, left, and bottom are painted, leaving the right side unpainted. Wait, but the problem says three sides are painted, so either way, two sides of one dimension and one of the other.\n\nWait, but the unpainted side is 9 feet. So, that side could be either the length or the width. Let me denote the sides. Let's say the length is L and the width is W. Now, in a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal, so if one side is L, the opposite is also L, and similarly for W.\n\nSo if three sides are painted, perhaps two lengths and one width, or two widths and one length. Let me consider both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: The three painted sides consist of two lengths (L) and one width (W). Then the unpainted side would be the other width. So the unpainted side is W, which is given as 9 feet. So W = 9.\n\nIn this case, the sum of the painted sides would be 2L + W = 37. Since W is 9, substitute: 2L + 9 =37. Subtract 9 from both sides: 2L=28. So L=14.\n\nThen the area would be L * W =14 *9=126. So that's option C.\n\nCase 2: The three painted sides consist of two widths (W) and one length (L). Then the unpainted side is the other length, so L=9. Then the sum of painted sides is W + 2L =37. Substituting L=9: W + 18=37. So W=19.\n\nArea would be L*W=9*19=171. Hmm, but 171 isn't one of the options. The options are 46,81,126,252, or E)None. So 171 isn't there. So in this case, if the area is 171, which isn't an option, that would imply that this case isn't correct.\n\nSo, the first case seems valid, giving an area of 126, which is option C. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me double-check the first scenario. If W is 9, then the painted sides are two Ls and one W. Sum is 2L + W =37. So 2L=37-9=28, so L=14. Area is 14*9=126. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, in the second scenario, if the unpainted side is L=9, then painted sides are two Ws and one L. So W + 2L =37. Since L=9, W=37-2*9=37-18=19. Area is 9*19=171, which isn't an option. So this case is invalid because the area isn't among the options, so the correct case is the first one.\n\nSo the area is 126, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Are there any other possibilities? What if the sides are arranged differently? Like, perhaps the three painted sides include one length and two widths, but that's the same as case 2. Or the other way around. No, I think that's the only two possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, could the three painted sides include both widths and one length, making the unpainted side another length? No, that's the same as case 2. Or, perhaps the three painted sides are one length and two widths, but again, same as case 2.\n\nWait another thought: maybe the three painted sides are all of one dimension, but that can't be because a rectangle has two of each. So no, that's not possible. So the only possibilities are case 1 and case 2.\n\nSo, given that, the correct area is 126, which is option C. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)46, B)81, C)126, D)252, E)None. So C is an option, so the answer would be C.\n\nBut wait, another way to approach this: let's denote the sides.\n\nLet me define the sides. Let's say the rectangle has length L and width W. If three sides are painted, it could be either:\n\n1. Two lengths and one width (so the unpainted is the other width), or\n2. Two widths and one length (so the unpainted is the other length).\n\nIn case 1: W is unpainted, so W=9. Painted sides: 2L + W=37 \u2192 2L=37-9=28 \u2192 L=14. Area=14*9=126 \u2192 option C.\n\nIn case 2: L is unpainted, so L=9. Painted sides: 2W + L=37 \u2192 2W=37-9=28 \u2192 W=14. Area=14*9=126 again. Wait, wait a minute! So in this case, whether the unpainted side is L or W, the area would be the same.\n\nWait, wait, that's interesting. Because in case 1, W is 9, L is 14. In case 2, L is 9, W is 14. So the area is L*W=14*9=126 in both cases. So regardless of whether the unpainted side is length or width, the area is the same. So why did I think in the second case the area was 171? Oh wait, no, I must have miscalculated earlier.\n\nWait, let's recalculate case 2. If the unpainted side is the length L, then L=9. The painted sides are two widths (W) and one length (L). So sum is 2W + L=37. Substituting L=9: 2W +9=37 \u2192 2W=28 \u2192 W=14. So area is L*W=9*14=126. Oh! So both cases give the same area. So I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought the area was 171. So in both cases, the area is 126. So that would mean the answer is C)126.\n\nWait, but then why did I get confused earlier? Oh, because in my initial calculation for case 2, I think I forgot that in that scenario, the painted sides are two Ws and one L. So if L is 9, then 2W +9=37 \u2192 W=14. So area is 9*14=126.\n\nSo both possibilities give the same area. So the answer is 126, which is option C. So that's the correct answer.\n",

This gives us two cases to consider:\n\n1. **Case 1: The unpainted side is a width (\\( W = 9 \\))**  \n   In this case, the painted sides consist of two lengths and one width. The sum of the painted sides is given by:  \n   \\[\n   2L + W = 37\n   \\]  \n   Substituting \\( W = 9 \\):  \n   \\[\n   2L + 9 = 37 \\implies 2L = 28 \\implies L = 14\n   \\]  \n   The area of the parking space is then:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = L \\times W = 14 \\times 9 = 126\n   \\]\n\n2. **Case 2: The unpainted side is a length (\\( L = 9 \\))**  \n   In this case, the painted sides consist of two widths and one length. The sum of the painted sides is given by:  \n   \\[\n   2W + L = 37\n   \\]  \n   Substituting \\( L = 9 \\):  \n   \\[\n   2W + 9 = 37 \\implies 2W = 28 \\implies W = 14\n   \\]  \n   The area of the parking space is then:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = L \\times W = 14 \\times 9 = 126\n   \\]\n\nIn both cases, the area of the parking space is \\( 126 \\, \\text{square feet} \\). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: C",
