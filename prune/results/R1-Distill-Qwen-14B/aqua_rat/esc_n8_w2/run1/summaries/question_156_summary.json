      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where the sum of k consecutive integers is 51, and the least integer is -50. I need to find what k is. The options are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since these are consecutive integers, the difference between each term is 1. \n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference. Here, d is 1 because they are consecutive integers.\n\nWait, another way I remember is that if the numbers are consecutive, the average multiplied by the number of terms gives the sum. The average would be the average of the first and last term. So maybe I can use that approach instead.\n\nThe first term is given as -50, and the last term would be -50 + (k-1)*1, which simplifies to -50 + k -1 = k -51.\n\nSo the average of the series is (first term + last term)/2. That would be (-50 + (k -51))/2. \n\nThen the sum S is average multiplied by the number of terms k. So S = [(-50 + k -51)/2] * k.\n\nWe know that the sum S is 51, so:\n\n[ (k - 101)/2 ] * k = 51\n\nLet me write that as an equation:\n\n(k - 101) * k = 102\n\nExpanding that gives:\n\nk\u00b2 - 101k -102 = 0\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, when I multiply both sides by 2, the equation becomes:\n\nk(k - 101) = 102.\n\nSo, k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nNow I need to solve this quadratic equation for k. Let's try factoring. Hmm, looking for two numbers that multiply to -102 and add up to -101. Let me think: 102 factors into 1 and 102, 2 and 51, 3 and 34, 6 and 17. \n\nSince the product is negative, one number is positive and the other negative. Let's see, 102 is positive, so perhaps 102 and 1. Let's see: 102 * (-1) = -102, and 102 + (-1) = 101. But in the equation, the middle term is -101k. So I think the factors would be (k - 102)(k + 1) = 0.\n\nWait, let me check: (k -102)(k +1) = k\u00b2 +k -102k -102 = k\u00b2 -101k -102. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the solutions are k = 102 and k = -1. But since k is the number of terms, it can't be negative. So k is 102.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 102. But wait, let me think again. Because if the first term is -50 and the series has 102 terms, the last term would be -50 + 101 (since the number of steps is k-1) which is 51. So the series goes from -50 to 51, inclusive.\n\nLet me check the sum. The number of terms is 102, starting at -50 and ending at 51. The average is (-50 +51)/2 = (1)/2 = 0.5. Sum is 0.5 *102 = 51. Yep, that works.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 102. But why is one of the options 102 when I thought the answer was E? So that must be correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Are there other possible solutions? Because sometimes quadratic equations have two solutions, but only one is valid in the context.\n\nIn this case, the other solution is k=-1, which doesn't make sense because the number of terms can't be negative. So the only valid solution is k=102.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 102, which is one of the choices. So the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nFirst, the sum S is 51, first term a is -50, number of terms is k, last term is a + (k-1)*1 = -50 + k -1 = k-51.\n\nSum is S = k*(a + l)/2, where l is last term.\n\nSo, S = k*(-50 + (k-51))/2 = 51.\n\nSo, k*(k - 101) = 102.\n\nSo, equation is k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nFactored as (k-102)(k+1)=0.\n\nSo k=102 or k=-1. Only 102 is valid.\n\nSo the answer is E)102.\n",

The options are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be found using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since these are consecutive integers, the difference between each term is 1. So it's an arithmetic sequence with common difference d=1.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. Alternatively, it's also written as S = n*(a1 + (a1 + (n-1)*d))/2. Since d is 1, that simplifies things.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the sum is equal to the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms. So S = k * (a1 + ak)/2. Since a1 is the first term, which is -50, and ak is the last term.\n\nBut wait, I don't know ak. Hmm. Oh right, but since these are consecutive integers, the last term can be expressed in terms of k. Because each term increases by 1, so the last term would be a1 + (k-1)*1. So ak = a1 + k-1. Which would be (-50) + (k-1).\n\nSo ak = k -51.\n\nSo the sum S is k*(a1 + ak)/2 = 51. Plugging in a1 and ak:\n\n51 = k*(-50 + (k -51))/2.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nSimplify the numerator: -50 + (k -51) = k - 50 -51 = k -101.\n\nSo, 51 = k*(k -101)/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 102 = k*(k -101).\n\nWhich gives the quadratic equation: k^2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me double-check that multiplication.\n\nWait, 51 = [k*(k-101)]/2. So multiplying both sides by 2: 102 = k*(k -101).\n\nExpanding that: k^2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because when you expand k*(k-101), it's k^2 -101k. So 102 = k^2 -101k \u2192 k^2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd because the quadratic is k squared minus 101k minus 102 equals zero. Hmm. Let me think, is there a better way to set this up?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the sum using the formula for the sum of consecutive numbers.\n\nAnother approach: the sum of k consecutive integers starting from a is S = k*a + (k*(k-1))/2. Because each term increases by 1, so the sum is a + (a+1) + (a+2) + ... + (a +k-1). That's equal to k*a + (0 +1 +2 + ... +k-1). The sum of 0 to (k-1) is (k-1)*k/2. So S = k*a + (k*(k-1))/2.\n\nIn this case, S is 51, a is -50. So:\n\n51 = k*(-50) + (k*(k-1))/2.\n\nLet me write that equation out:\n\n51 = -50k + (k\u00b2 -k)/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n102 = -100k + k\u00b2 -k.\n\nSimplify the right side: 102 = k\u00b2 -101k.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nk\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nSame quadratic as before. So that's correct.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for k.\n\nThe quadratic is: k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula: k = [101 \u00b1 sqrt(101^2 + 4*1*102)] / 2.\n\nCompute the discriminant: D = (101)^2 + 4*102.\n\n101 squared is 10201. 4*102 is 408. So D=10201 + 408 = 10609.\n\nWhat's the square root of 10609? Hmm. Let me think. 100^2 is 10000, 103^2 is 10609. Because 103*103 is 10609. So sqrt(10609)=103.\n\nSo k = [101 \u00b1 103]/2.\n\nThat gives two possibilities:\n\nk = (101 + 103)/2 = 204/2 = 102.\n\nOr k = (101 - 103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nBut k can't be negative because the number of terms can't be negative. So k=102.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 102. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check because 102 seems quite large. Let me verify if this makes sense.\n\nWait, let's calculate the sum of 102 consecutive integers starting from -50.\n\nThe last term would be a1 + (k-1) = -50 +101=51.\n\nThe sum is (number of terms)*(first term + last term)/2.\n\nSo sum = 102 * (-50 +51)/2 = 102*(1)/2 = 51. That's correct.\n\nSo yes, k=102 is the right answer. So the correct option is E.\n",

So sqrt(10609)=103.\n\nSo k = [101 \u00b1 103]/2.\n\nThat gives two possibilities:\n\nk = (101 + 103)/2 = 204/2 = 102.\n\nOr k = (101 - 103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nBut k can't be negative because the number of terms can't be negative. So k=102.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 102. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check because 102 seems quite large. Let me verify if this makes sense.\n\nWait, let's calculate the sum of 102 consecutive integers starting from -50.\n\nThe last term would be a1 + (k-1) = -50 +101=51.\n\nThe sum is (number of terms)*(first term + last term)/2.\n\nSo sum = 102 * (-50 +51)/2 = 102*(1)/2 = 51. That's correct.\n\nSo yes, k=102 is the right answer. So the correct option is E.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum \\( S \\) of \\( k \\) consecutive integers starting from \\( a_1 \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot (a_1 + a_k),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a_k \\) is the last term. Since the integers are consecutive, \\( a_k = a_1 + (k - 1) \\). Substituting \\( a_1 = -50 \\), we find:\n\n\\[\na_k = -50 + (k - 1) = k - 51.\n\\]\n\nThe sum is given as \\( S = 51 \\), so:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot (-50 + k - 51).\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot (k - 101).\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n102 = k \\cdot (k - 101).\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nk^2 - 101k - 102 = 0.\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -101 \\), and \\( c = -102 \\). Compute the discriminant:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = (-101)^2 + 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 102 = 10201 + 408 = 10609.\n\\]\n\nThe square root of \\( 10609 \\) is \\( 103 \\), so:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{101 \\pm 103}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThis gives two solutions:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{101 + 103}{2} = 102, \\quad \\text{or} \\quad k = \\frac{101 - 103}{2} = -1.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( k \\) must be positive, we have \\( k = 102 \\). Verifying, the sum of 102 consecutive integers starting from -50 is indeed 51, confirming the solution.\n\nAnswer: E",
