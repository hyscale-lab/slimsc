      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where two balls, A and B, are rotating along a circular track. I need to find out when they'll both be back at the starting point again after starting together. Hmm, let me think.\n\nAlright, the problem says Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. So, first, I guess I should find out how long it takes for Ball A to complete one rotation. If 2 rotations take 26 minutes, then one rotation would take 26 divided by 2. Let me calculate that: 26/2 is 13. So, Ball A takes 13 minutes per rotation.\n\nThen, Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. So, similar to A, I can find B's time per rotation. 35 minutes divided by 5 rotations equals 7 minutes per rotation. So B takes 7 minutes for each full turn.\n\nWait, but the question is when they'll both be back at the starting point again. That sounds like I'm looking for the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation periods. Because LCM gives the smallest time they both complete an integer number of rotations and end up at the start.\n\nSo the periods are 13 minutes for A and 7 minutes for B. Let me find the LCM of 13 and 7. Both are prime numbers, right? So the LCM of two primes is just their product. So 13 *7 is 91. So the LCM is 91 minutes.\n\nWait, but the options given are in hours and minutes. So I need to convert 91 minutes into hours and minutes. Let me see: 60 minutes is 1 hour. 91 minus 60 is 31. So that's 1 hour and 31 minutes. Looking at the options, option A is 1 hour and 31 minutes. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Another approach: each time A completes a rotation, it's at 13, 26, 39, etc. minutes. B is at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, etc. When do these numbers coincide?\n\nLooking for the first common multiple. 13 and 7 are coprime, so LCM is 91. So yes, 91 minutes is 1 hour and 31 minutes. That's option A.\n",

Oh right, that's about finding when both of their rotations bring them back to the start at the same time. So this sounds like a least common multiple (LCM) problem.
