      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about factors and prime numbers. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is asking about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. I need to figure out which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, if a number has a prime factorization of the form p1^a * p2^b * p3^c..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nIn this case, Q has 5 factors. Wait, 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write 5 as a product is 5*1. That means the number of exponents plus one multiplied together must equal 5. So the exponents plus one would have to be 5 and 1. \n\nWait, but exponents can't be negative, so the exponents themselves would have to be 4 and 0. But wait, no. Let me think again. Because if the number of exponents plus one multiply to 5, the only possibility is that there's only one prime factor, and its exponent is 4. Because (4+1) =5, and that's it. So Q would be p^4, where p is a prime number. \n\nSo looking at the options:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Well, a square is p^2. But if Q is p^4, that's the fourth power, not the square. So I don't think I is correct.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, p squared is p^2, which would have (2+1)=3 factors. So if Q is p^4, then it's (4+1)=5 factors. So I is saying Q is the square of a prime, which would give 3 factors, but Q has 5. So I is false.\n\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime number. That's correct because p^4 has exactly 5 factors. So II is true.\n\nIII. Q is the product of two primes. If Q were the product of two primes, say p and q, then its prime factorization would be p^1 * q^1. So the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. But Q has 5 factors, which isn't 4. So III is not true.\n\nWait, so the only statement that's true is II. So looking at the options, option C is II only. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check. Are there any other possibilities for the number of exponents? Like, can Q have more than one prime factor and still have 5 factors?\n\nWait, 5 is a prime number. So the only way to write 5 as a product is 5*1. So the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. So that could only happen if there's one exponent of 4 and the rest are zero (since 4+1=5). So, for example, if there are two primes, their exponents would have to be 4 and 0. But exponents can't be negative, and 0 would imply that prime isn't present. So actually, there can't be more than one prime factor because that would require the product of (a+1)(b+1)... etc. to equal 5, which is only possible if one exponent is 4 and the others are zero. So that means Q must be a single prime raised to the fourth power. So yeah, II is the only correct statement.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C, which is II only. Let me check the options again. Option C is II only. So yes, that's the one.\n",

Let me think. Oh right, if a number Q has a prime factorization of the form p^a * q^b, where p and q are primes, then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1). So for example, if a number is p^2, then it has (2+1)=3 factors: 1, p, p\u00b2.\n\nWait, the problem says Q has 5 factors. 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 = 5*1. So that means the exponents in the prime factorization must satisfy (a+1)(b+1) =5. Since 5 is prime, one of the terms must be 5 and the other must be 1. So either (a+1)=5 and (b+1)=1, or vice versa. But since exponents can't be negative, the second case where (b+1)=1 would mean b=0, which implies that the prime q isn't actually a factor. So effectively, Q can only have one prime factor raised to the 4th power because a+1=5 implies a=4.\n\nSo that means Q must be p^4, where p is a prime number. Let me think about the options given.\n\nStatement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q = p^4, then that's (p\u00b2)^2, so the square of p squared. Wait, but the square of a prime would be p\u00b2, which would have (2+1)=3 factors, not 5. Oh wait, no, statement I is that Q is the square of a prime, so Q = p\u00b2. But in our case, Q is p^4, so I is not correct? Wait, no, because p^4 is the fourth power of a prime, not the square. So statement I is only true if Q is p\u00b2. But in our case, Q is p^4, so statement I is false.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, if p is a prime, then p squared is p\u00b2, which has (2+1)=3 factors. But in our case, Q is p^4, which is (p\u00b2)^2, but that's the fourth power. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So p^4 is the square of p\u00b2, which is a square, but p\u00b2 is a prime? No, p\u00b2 is not a prime unless p is 1, which it's not because primes are greater than 1. So p\u00b2 is not a prime; it's a composite. So statement I is incorrect because Q is the fourth power of a prime, not the square of a prime.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me reevaluate. If statement I says Q is the square of a prime number. So if Q is p^4, is that the square of a prime? Let me see: p^4 is (p^2)^2, so yes, it's the square of p squared. But p squared isn't a prime; it's a composite. So the square of a prime would be (prime)^2, which is p\u00b2. So in this case, Q is p^4, which is not the square of a prime but the square of a composite number. So statement I is not true.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. If Q is the square of a prime, then Q would be p\u00b2, which has 3 factors. But our Q has 5 factors, so that's not possible. So statement I is false because Q is p^4, not p\u00b2. So statement I is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, no. Let me get this straight. The question is, which of these statements must be true about Q. So if Q has exactly 5 factors, which is (4+1)=5, then it must be of the form p^4. So, which statements are true?\n\nStatement I: Q is the square of a prime. So Q = p\u00b2. As we saw, that would give 3 factors, which is less than 5. So I is false.\n\nStatement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. So Q = p^4. Yes, that's correct because (4+1)=5 factors. So II is true.\n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two primes. So Q = p*q, where p and q are primes. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) =4, which is not 5. So III is false.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. What if the exponents are arranged differently? Wait, 5 is prime, so the only way to write the number of factors as a product is 5*1. So the prime factorization must have only one prime factor with exponent 4. So Q is p^4, so only statement II is correct. So looking back at the options:\n\nOption C is II only. So the answer should be C.\n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) I only\n\nB) III only\n\nC) II only\n\nD) I and II only\n\nE) I and III only\n\nSo the correct answer would be C.
