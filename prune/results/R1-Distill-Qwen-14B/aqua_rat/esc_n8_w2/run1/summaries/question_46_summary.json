      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about population growth. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says the population increases by 5% annually. The current population is 78,000, and we need to find out what it'll be in two years.\n\nWait, so I remember that percentage increase can be calculated each year. So each year, the population is multiplied by 1 plus the growth rate. Oh right, because 5% is like 0.05 in decimal. So the formula should be something like:\n\nPopulation after n years = Initial population * (1 + growth rate)^n\n\nIn this case, n is 2 years. So plugging in the numbers, it should be 78,000 times (1.05) squared. Let me break that down.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate 1.05 squared. 1.05 multiplied by 1.05. Hmm, 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.05 is 0.05, 0.05 times 1 is another 0.05, and 0.05 times 0.05 is 0.0025. Adding those together: 1 + 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.0025 equals 1.1025. So 1.05 squared is 1.1025.\n\nNow, multiply that by 78,000. Let me see, 78,000 * 1.1025. Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute 78,000 * 1.1 first, and then adjust for the 0.0025.\n\nWait, 78,000 * 1.1 is 78,000 + 7,800 (which is 10% of 78k). So 78,000 +7,800 is 85,800. But wait, that's only for the first year. Wait no, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, 1.1025 is for two years. So I think I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nLet me think again. So for two years, the multiplier is 1.1025. So 78,000 multiplied by 1.1025. Let's compute that.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute each year's population step by step. Maybe that's easier.\n\nFirst year: 78,000 * 5% increase.\n\n5% of 78,000 is 78,000 * 0.05. Let's see, 78,000 * 0.05 is 3,900. So the population after the first year is 78,000 +3,900 = 81,900. That's the population after year one.\n\nNow, the second year, it's another 5% increase on 81,900. So 5% of 81,900. Let me compute that.\n\n5% is 0.05, so 81,900 * 0.05. Let's see, 80,000 *0.05 is 4,000, and 1,900 *0.05 is 95. So 4,000 +95=4,095.\n\nSo adding that to 81,900, the population after the second year is 81,900 +4,095 = 85,995.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 85,995. So that's the answer? Or did I miscalculate?\n\nWait, another way: 78,000 * (1.05)^2. So 78,000 * 1.1025.\n\nLet me compute 78,000 *1.1025.\n\nBreaking it down: 78,000 * 1 =78,000.\n\n78,000 *0.1025. Let's compute 0.1 is 7,800, 0.0025 is 195. Because 78,000 *0.0025 is 78,000*(25/10000) = (78,000 / 400) )= 195.\n\nSo 0.1025 is 7,800 +195=7,995. So total is 78,000 +7,995=85,995. Yep, same as before.\n\nSo the correct population after two years is 85,995, which is option B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options: option C is 85,800. That's what I get when I compute 78,000 *1.1, which is 85,800. So that's only after one year? No, wait, no. Wait, 1.1 is 10% increase, but 5% for two years would be 1.05^2, which is 1.1025, so 85,995.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B. But let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)81900 \u2192 that's after the first year.\n\nB)85995 \u2192 which is our calculation.\n\nC)85800 \u2192 which is 78,000 *1.1, perhaps someone might think it's 10% per year for two years, which would be wrong.\n\nD)90000 \u2192 that's much higher, perhaps someone might think 5% of 78,000 is 3,900, so 78,000 + (3,900 *2) = 85,800. Wait, that's 85,800, which is option C. So that approach is wrong because each year's increase is based on the new population, not the original.\n\nSo the correct answer is B)85,995.\n",

Let's compute 0.1 is 7,800, 0.0025 is 195. Because 78,000 *0.0025 is 78,000*(25/10000) = (78,000 / 400) )= 195.\n\nSo 0.1025 is 7,800 +195=7,995. So total is 78,000 +7,995=85,995.

The options are A) 81900, B)85995, C)85800, D)90000, E) None of these.\n\nHmm, I remember that population growth with a percentage increase each year is a common problem. I think it's a case of compound growth, right? Like, each year's population is the previous year's plus 5% of that. So it's not a simple addition of 5% each time but compounded.\n\nSo the formula for compound interest (or in this case, population growth) is A = P*(1 + r)^t. Where A is the amount after time t, P is the principal amount (initial population), r is the rate of increase, and t is the time in years.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm getting the variables right. Here, P is 78,000, r is 5% which is 0.05, and t is 2 years.\n\nSo plugging into the formula: A = 78000 * (1 + 0.05)^2.\n\nCalculating that step by step. First, 1 + 0.05 is 1.05. Then, 1.05 squared. Let me compute that: 1.05 * 1.05. Hmm, 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.05 is 0.05, 0.05 times 1 is 0.05, and 0.05 times 0.05 is 0.0025. Adding them up: 1 + 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.0025 = 1.1025.

Second year: 81900 * 1.05. Let's compute that. 81900 * 1.05. Let me break it down: 81900 * 1 = 81900, 81900 * 0.05 = 4095. So 81900 + 4095 = 85995. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo both methods give the same result. So the correct answer is B)85995.\n\n\nTo determine the population of the city in 2 years with an annual growth rate of 5%, we use the compound growth formula:\n\n\\[\nA = P \\cdot (1 + r)^t\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P = 78,000 \\) (initial population),\n- \\( r = 0.05 \\) (5% annual growth rate),\n- \\( t = 2 \\) (number of years).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the growth factor\n\\[\n(1 + r)^t = (1 + 0.05)^2 = 1.05^2 = 1.1025\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Apply the growth factor\n\\[\nA = 78,000 \\cdot 1.1025\n\\]\n\nBreaking it down:\n\\[\n78,000 \\cdot 1 = 78,000, \\quad 78,000 \\cdot 0.10 = 7,800, \\quad 78,000 \\cdot 0.0025 = 195\n\\]\nAdding these:\n\\[\n78,000 + 7,800 + 195 = 85,995\n\\]\n\n### Verification\nTo confirm, calculate year by year:\n- **First year**: \\( 78,000 + 5\\% \\text{ of } 78,000 = 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900 \\)\n- **Second year**: \\( 81,900 + 5\\% \\text{ of } 81,900 = 81,900 + 4,095 = 85,995 \\)\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: **85,995**.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe population after 2 years is **85,995**, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",
