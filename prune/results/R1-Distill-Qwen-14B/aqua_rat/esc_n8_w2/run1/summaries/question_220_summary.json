      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about average wages, and I need to find out what the worker earned on the 8th day. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nHmm, the problem says that the average wages over 15 days is $90 per day. So first, I should probably calculate the total wages for all 15 days. Since average is total divided by number of days, the total would be average multiplied by the number of days. So 15 days times $90 per day. Let me compute that: 15 * 90 is 1350. So total wages are $1350.\n\nNow, the first 7 days have an average of $87. So the total for these 7 days would be 7 * 87. Let me calculate that: 7 times 80 is 560, and 7 times 7 is 49, so 560 + 49 is 609. So first 7 days sum up to $609.\n\nThe last 7 days have an average of $92. So their total is 7 * 92. Let me see, 7*90 is 630, and 7*2 is 14, so 630 +14=644. So last 7 days sum to $644.\n\nWait, but the total of the first 7 and the last 7 would be 609 + 644. Let's add that: 609 + 644. 600+600=1200, 9+44=53. So 1200+53=1253. So together, the first 7 and last 7 days give 1253.\n\nBut the total for all 15 days is 1350. So the 8th day must account for the difference between 1350 and 1253. Let me subtract: 1350 - 1253 = 97. So the wage on the 8th day is $97.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The 15 days include days 1-7, day 8, and days 9-15. Oh wait, days 9-15 are 7 days, right? So the 8th day is the middle one, and the total of days 1-7 is 609, days 9-15 is 644. So adding those gives 609+644=1253. The total of all 15 days is 1350, so the 8th day is 1350 - 1253 = 97. That makes sense.\n\nSo looking at the options, option D is $97. So the answer should be D.\n",

Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nAlright, so the average wage for the entire 15 days is $90 per day. That means the total wages for the fortnight would be 15 multiplied by 90. Let me calculate that: 15 * 90 = 1350. So the total is $1350.\n\nNow, the problem says that during the first 7 days, the average was $87 per day. So the total for those 7 days is 7 * 87.

So the first 7 days, then the 8th day, and then the next 7 days. So the 8th day is the middle day.
