      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Arjun and Sajal have some money, and there are two scenarios involving giving money between them. Hmm, let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nAlright, the first condition: If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. Wait, Arun is another name for Arjun, right? So maybe it's a typo. Let me assume it's Arjun giving $30 to Sajal.\n\nSo, let's denote Arjun's money as A and Sajal's as S. So after Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Arjun's money becomes A - 30, and Sajal's becomes S + 30. According to the problem, at this point, Sajal's money is twice what Arjun has. So the equation would be:\n\nS + 30 = 2 * (A - 30)\n\nThat's the first equation.\n\nThe second condition is: If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as what's left with Sajal. So Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, so Arjun has A + 10, and Sajal has S - 10. Then Arjun's money is three times Sajal's. So the equation is:\n\nA + 10 = 3 * (S - 10)\n\nNow I have two equations:\n\n1) S + 30 = 2*(A - 30)\n2) A + 10 = 3*(S - 10)\n\nI can solve these equations step by step. Let's start with the first equation.\n\nExpanding equation 1:\nS + 30 = 2A - 60\nLet me bring all terms to one side:\nS = 2A -60 -30\nS = 2A -90\n\nSo S = 2A -90. Let me keep that as equation 1a.\n\nNow, equation 2:\nA +10 = 3(S -10)\nExpanding:\nA +10 = 3S -30\nBring terms together:\nA = 3S -30 -10\nA = 3S -40\n\nSo equation 2a is A = 3S -40.\n\nNow, substitute equation 1a into equation 2a.\n\nFrom 1a, S = 2A -90. Substitute into 2a:\n\nA = 3*(2A -90) -40\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nA = 6A - 270 -40\nA = 6A - 310\n\nNow, subtract 6A from both sides:\nA -6A = -310\n-5A = -310\nDivide both sides by -5:\nA = (-310)/(-5) = 62\n\nSo Arjun has $62. Now, substitute A=62 into equation 1a:\n\nS = 2*62 -90 = 124 -90 = 34.\n\nWait, so Sajal has $34. Let me check the options.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 62,34. Option C is 34,62 which is S and A swapped. So the correct pair is A=62, S=34, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my equations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst scenario: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal.\n\nArjun's money: 62-30=32. Sajal's:34+30=64. 64 is twice 32, which is correct.\n\nSecond scenario: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun.\n\nArjun's money:62+10=72. Sajal's:34-10=24. 72 is thrice 24, correct.\n\nSo yes, the calculations are correct. So the answer should be option B, which is 62 and 34.\n",

And if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as what's left with Sajal. I need to find out how much each of them has.\n\nWait, so I think I should assign variables to their current amounts. Let me call Arjun's money 'A' and Sajal's money 'S'. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the first scenario: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal. So Arjun's new amount is A - 30, and Sajal's becomes S + 30. According to the problem, after this transaction, Sajal has twice as much as Arjun. So I can write the equation:\n\nS + 30 = 2*(A - 30)\n\nLet me write that down as equation (1): S + 30 = 2(A - 30)\n\nThe second scenario: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun.
