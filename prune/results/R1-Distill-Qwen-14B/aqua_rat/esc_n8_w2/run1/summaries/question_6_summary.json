      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about marbles, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.\n\nSo, the setup is that there's a bag with only white marbles. Then, 20 marbles are pulled out, painted black, and put back into the bag. After that, another 20 marbles are pulled out, and among those, 1 was black. Then they returned all of them back to the bag. The question is, if the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles are in the bag in total, which is Q?\n\nHmm, wait, I need to find Q, the total number of marbles in the bag now. Let me think about what's happening step by step.\n\nFirst, the bag initially has only white marbles. Let's say the initial number of marbles is N. But wait, after the first step, we add 20 black marbles. Or wait, no. Because they took out 20 white marbles, painted them black, and put them back. So after that step, the bag has N marbles, but 20 of them are now black. So the total number of marbles in the bag remains N, but 20 are black and the rest are white.\n\nThen, the second time, 20 marbles are pulled out. Of those, 1 was black. So the proportion of black marbles in that sample is 1/20, which is 5%. The problem states that this percentage (5%) represents their percentage in the bag. So the percentage of black marbles in the entire bag is 5%.\n\nWait, but how many black marbles are in the bag? Because after the first step, we have 20 black marbles. So the total number of black marbles is 20. So if the bag has Q marbles in total now, 20/Q should be equal to 0.05 (5%). Because that's the percentage.\n\nSo setting up the equation: 20 / Q = 0.05. Solving for Q, we get Q = 20 / 0.05 = 400. So the total number of marbles is 400.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Because the initial step was taking out 20 white marbles, painting them black, and putting them back. So the total number of marbles didn't change. Because you took 20 out, painted, and put them back. So the initial number N remains the same. Then, in the second step, they took out 20 marbles, found one black, and put all back. So the total marbles are still N. So the 20 black marbles are part of N.\n\nSo the percentage is 20 / N = 5% (because the sample pulled had 5% black marbles). So 20/N = 0.05. So N = 20 / 0.05 = 400. So the total marbles are 400.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 400. So the answer should be D.\n",

After that, another 20 marbles were pulled out, and 1 of them was black. Then, they were all returned to the bag. The percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. We need to find the total number of marbles in the bag, which is Q.\n\nWait, wait. Let me break this down. Initially, all marbles are white. So, when 20 are taken out, painted black, and put back, the bag now has 20 black marbles and the rest white. Then, the second draw of 20 marbles had 1 black. So, the percentage of black marbles in the bag must be such that when you take 20 marbles, the chance of getting black is the same as their proportion in the bag.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time equals their percentage in the bag. So, the proportion in the bag is equal to the proportion found in the second draw. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about this. Let's denote the total number of marbles in the bag after adding the 20 black marbles as Q. Because when you take out 20, paint them, and put them back, the total remains the same as before. Wait, no. Wait, initially, the bag had a certain number of marbles. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, the initial number isn't given. Wait, wait. Let me re-read the problem.\n\n20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. So, the bag had some number of white marbles. Then, 20 were taken out, painted black, and returned. So, the total number of marbles in the bag becomes original number plus 20? No, wait, because you took 20 out, painted them, and put them back. So the total remains the same as before. Because you're taking 20 white marbles, painting them black, and putting them back. So the total number of marbles is the same as before. Wait, but wait: the original bag had all white marbles. After adding 20 black marbles, the total is same as before because you took out 20, painted, and returned. So the total marbles in the bag after first step is the same as before, but now there are 20 black marbles.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial bag had N marbles, all white. Then, 20 were pulled out, painted black, and put back. So the total number of marbles is still N, but now there are 20 black marbles and (N - 20) white marbles? No, wait, because you took 20 white marbles, painted them black, and returned them. So, the initial N marbles were white. After taking 20 out, painting, and putting back, the bag has N marbles again. But now, 20 of them are black, and the remaining (N - 20) are white.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, when you take 20 marbles out of the bag, which initially has all white marbles, you have 20 white marbles. You paint them black, so now you have 20 black marbles. Then, you put them back into the bag. So the total marbles in the bag is N (original) plus 20? No, because you took 20 out and put them back. So the total remains N. So the bag now has N marbles, 20 of which are black, and (N-20) white.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because you took 20 marbles out of N, painted them black, and then put them back. So the total number remains N. So now, in the bag, there are 20 black marbles and (N - 20) white marbles. So the total marbles is still N, but composition has changed.\n\nWait, but in the first step, when you take 20 marbles out, paint them, and put them back, the total number of marbles doesn't change. So after that, the bag has 20 black marbles and (N-20) white marbles, totaling N marbles.\n\nThen, in the second step, another 20 marbles were pulled out. Of those, 1 was black. So in the second draw, 1 out of 20 was black, which is 5%. The problem states that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. So the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 5%?\n\nWait, because in the second draw, 5% of the 20 were black. So the percentage in the bag must be 5% as well. So 5% of the total marbles in the bag are black.\n\nBut wait, after the first step, the bag has 20 black marbles. So, 20 = 5% of the total marbles. Because 5% is the proportion in the bag.\n\nSo, 20 = 0.05 * Q, where Q is the total number of marbles.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The proportion in the bag is 5%, so 5% of Q is equal to the number of black marbles. But the number of black marbles is 20. So 0.05 * Q = 20. Solving for Q gives Q = 20 / 0.05 = 400.\n\nSo the total marbles in the bag is 400. So the answer would be D) 400.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So the initial N was the same as after putting back the 20 marbles. So N is equal to the total marbles after the first step, which is the same as before. Wait, but earlier I thought the initial N is the same as the Q. So Q is 400.\n\nSo the options are A)40, B)200, C)380, D)400, E)3200.\n\nSo the correct answer is D)400.\n",
