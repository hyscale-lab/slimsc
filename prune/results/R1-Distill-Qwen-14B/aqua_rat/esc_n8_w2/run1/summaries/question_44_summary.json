      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a 5-digit number with a specific property. Hmm, let's try to break it down. The problem says that if you add a 1 after the number, it becomes three times as large as when you add a 1 before the number. Wait, wait, I need to make sure I understand that correctly.\n\nSo, let me paraphrase. Let's say the number is N, which is a 5-digit number. If I place a 1 after N, that's like writing 10 times N plus 1, right? Because adding a digit at the end multiplies the number by 10 and adds the new digit. So, N with a 1 after it would be 10*N + 1.\n\nOn the other hand, adding a 1 before N would mean placing 1 in the ten-thousands place. Since N is a 5-digit number, adding a 1 before it would be 100000 + N. Because the 1 is in the sixth digit, making it 100,000 plus N. \n\nThe problem states that the number after adding 1 at the end is three times the number after adding 1 at the beginning. So, the equation would be:\n\n10*N + 1 = 3*(100000 + N)\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n10N + 1 = 3*(100000 + N)\n\nNow, I'll expand the right side:\n\n10N + 1 = 300000 + 3N\n\nHmm, let's subtract 3N from both sides to get all the N terms on one side:\n\n10N - 3N + 1 = 300000\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n7N + 1 = 300000\n\nThen, subtract 1 from both sides:\n\n7N = 299999\n\nNow, divide both sides by 7 to find N:\n\nN = 299999 / 7\n\nLet me calculate that. Hmm, 7 into 299999. Let's see, 7 * 42857 is 299,999 because 7 * 42857 = 299,999. Oh, right, because 42857 is a well-known repeating decimal number. So, N would be 42857.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 42857. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's take N as 42857.\n\nAdding a 1 after it: 428571. Adding a 1 before it: 142857.\n\nNow, check if 428571 equals three times 142857.\n\nCalculating 142857 *3: 142,857 *3. Let's do the multiplication.\n\n142,857 *3:\n7*3=21, write down 1, carryover 2.\n5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1.\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n1*3=3 +1=4. So the product is 428,571.\n\nYes, that matches exactly. So, 428571 is three times 142857. Therefore, option A is correct.\n",

The property is that when you add a 1 after it, the number becomes three times as large as when you add a 1 before it. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a 5-digit number, let's call it N. If we put a 1 after N, making it a 6-digit number, this new number should be three times the number we get when we put a 1 before N. Wait, no, wait\u2014no, wait, no. Wait, putting a 1 before N would make it a 6-digit number as well. Oh, wait, no, N is 5 digits, so putting a 1 before it would make it a 6-digit number starting with 1. Similarly, putting a 1 after would add another digit at the end.\n\nSo, let me represent N as a 5-digit number. Let's say N is ABCDE, where each letter is a digit. But maybe it's easier to think of N numerically. Let's denote N as a number, not as individual digits.\n\nSo, when we add a 1 after N, it's like multiplying N by 10 and adding 1. So mathematically, that would be 10*N + 1. Because, for example, if N was 123, adding 1 after would make 1231, which is 123*10 +1=1230+1=1231.\n\nOn the other hand, adding a 1 before N would be like taking N and adding 100000 (since N is 5 digits) and then adding N. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If N is 12345, adding 1 before would make it 112345. So, that's 100000 + N. Because N is 5 digits, adding a digit before it would be N + 100000? Wait, no. Wait, no: 12345 is 12345. Adding a 1 before it would be 112345, which is 100000 + 12345 = 112345. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the condition given is that 10*N + 1 = 3*(100000 + N). Because when you add 1 after N, it's 3 times the number you get when you add 1 before N.\n\nSo, let's set up the equation:\n\n10*N + 1 = 3*(100000 + N)\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n10N + 1 = 3*(100000 + N)\n\nLet me expand the right side:\n\n10N + 1 = 300000 + 3N\n\nNow, I'll bring all terms to one side. Subtract 3N from both sides:\n\n7N + 1 = 300000\n\nThen, subtract 1 from both sides:\n\n7N = 299,999\n\nSo, N = 299,999 / 7\n\nLet me compute that. Hmm, 299,999 divided by 7.\n\nLet's calculate 7 * 42857: 42857 *7. Let me do the math step by step.\n\n7*40000 = 280000.\n\n7*2800 = 19600 \u2192 280000 + 19600 = 299600.\n\n7*57 = 399.\n\nSo 299600 + 399 = 299,999. Oh, that's exactly the numerator.\n\nSo, 299,999 /7 =42857.\n\nSo N is 42857.\n\nWait, let me confirm this. Let's take N=42857.\n\nAdding a 1 after N would be 428571. Adding a 1 before N would be 142857.\n\nNow, let's see if 428571 is three times 142857.\n\n3 * 142857 = 428,571. Yes, exactly.\n\nSo, the number is 42857, which is option A.\n",
