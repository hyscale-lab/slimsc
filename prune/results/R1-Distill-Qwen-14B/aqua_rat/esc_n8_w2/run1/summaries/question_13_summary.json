      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about two machines producing yo-yos, and I need to figure out after how many minutes they'll have produced 10 yo-yos in total. Hmm, let me think. \n\nThe problem says Machine A makes a yo-yo every 6 minutes, and Machine B every 9 minutes. I guess they start at the same time, maybe? So I need to find when together they have made 10 yo-yos. \n\nWait, but each machine is working independently, right? So I should probably calculate how many each machine produces in a certain amount of time and add them up to see when they reach 10.\n\nLet me think about the rates. Machine A produces one every 6 minutes, so in t minutes, it would produce t/6 yo-yos. Similarly, Machine B would produce t/9 in the same time. So the total would be t/6 + t/9. I need this sum to equal 10.\n\nSo setting up the equation: t/6 + t/9 = 10. I'll solve for t. To add the fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 9 is 18. So converting the fractions:\n\nt/6 = (3t)/18\nt/9 = (2t)/18\n\nAdding them together gives (3t + 2t)/18 = 5t/18. So 5t/18 = 10.\n\nMultiply both sides by 18: 5t = 180. Then divide by 5: t = 36. So 36 minutes is when they have produced 10 yo-yos together.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. In 36 minutes, Machine A would have made 36/6 = 6 yo-yos. Machine B would have made 36/9 = 4 yo-yos. 6 +4 is 10. Yes, that adds up. So the answer should be 36 minutes. Looking at the options, option C is 36. So the answer is C.\n",

Let me read it again carefully.\n\nMachine A puts out a yo-yo every 6 minutes, and Machine B does the same every 9 minutes. The question is, after how many minutes will they have produced 10 yo-yos in total? The options are A)24, B)32, C)36, D)64, E)72.\n\nHmm. So I think I need to figure out how many yo-yos each machine makes over time and see when their combined total reaches 10. Let me break it down.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem says \"after how many minutes will they have produced 10 yo-yos?\" So it's about the total number of yo-yos from both machines combined reaching 10. So I need to find the time t where the sum of the yo-yos from A and B equals 10.\n\nRight. So, for each machine, the number of yo-yos produced by time t is t divided by their respective intervals, right? But wait, since they produce one every 6 and 9 minutes, the number of yo-yos would be t divided by the interval, but since they can't produce a fraction of a yo-yo, we take the integer part. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think. Because they produce one every 6 minutes, so at 6 minutes, A has made 1, at 12 minutes, 2, etc. So for any time t, the number of yo-yos is the floor of t divided by 6, but only if t is a multiple of 6. Otherwise, it's the integer part. Wait, no, because if t is 7 minutes, Machine A would have made 1 yo-yo, right? Because it produces one every 6 minutes. So the formula is floor(t / 6) for A, and floor(t /9) for B.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem is to find the time when the sum is exactly 10. But perhaps the time when the sum reaches 10 for the first time. Because each machine's production is periodic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model this as a rate problem. Machine A produces 1/6 yo-yos per minute, and Machine B produces 1/9 per minute. So together, their combined rate is (1/6 + 1/9) per minute. Let's compute that.\n\n1/6 is approximately 0.1667, and 1/9 is about 0.1111. Adding them gives 0.2778 yo-yos per minute. So the time t would be 10 divided by this rate. Let me compute that: 10 / (1/6 + 1/9) = 10 / ( (3 + 2)/18 ) = 10 / (5/18) ) = 10 * (18/5) = 36 minutes. So that would suggest the answer is C)36.\n\nWait, but wait. Is this the correct approach? Because the rate method assumes that the production is continuous, but in reality, the machines produce a yo-yo every fixed interval, so it's more of a discrete process. So perhaps the rate approach isn't accurate here because it's assuming continuous production, but the actual process is in discrete steps.\n\nHmm. So maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think about the number of yo-yos each machine produces at various times.\n\nLet me list the times when each machine produces a yo-yo.\n\nMachine A: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, etc. So at 6 minutes, it's 1, 12 is 2, 18 is 3, and so on.\n\nMachine B: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, etc. So at 9 minutes, 1, 18 is 2, 27 is 3, 36 is 4.\n\nNow, I'll make a timeline and count the total yo-yos as time increases.\n\nTime 0: A=0, B=0. Total=0.\n\nAt 6 min: A=1, B=0. Total=1.\n\nAt 9 min: A=1 (since 9 <12), B=1. Total=2.\n\nAt 12 min: A=2, B=1. Total=3.\n\nAt 18 min: A=3, B=2. Total=5.\n\nAt 24 min: A=4, B=2. (Because 24 /9 is 2.666, so B has made 2.) Total=6.\n\nAt 27 min: A=4 (since 27/6=4.5 \u2192 4), B=3. Total=7.\n\nAt 30 min: A=5, B=3. Total=8.\n\nAt 36 min: A=6 (36/6=6), B=4 (36/9=4). Total=10.\n\nOh, so at 36 minutes, they've produced a total of 10 yo-yos. So the answer is C)36.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. So between 30 and 36 minutes, what happens?\n\nAt 30 minutes: A has produced 5, B has produced 3 (since 30/9 is ~3.333, so floor is 3). Total 8.\n\nThen, at 36 minutes, A produces the 6th yo-yo (since 36 is a multiple of 6), and B produces the 4th (36 is a multiple of 9). So 6 +4=10. So yes, 36 minutes is the correct answer.\n\nSo the options are C)36.\n",
