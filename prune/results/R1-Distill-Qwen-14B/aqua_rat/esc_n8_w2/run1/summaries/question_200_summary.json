      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says there are three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. They each have different probabilities of answering a question correctly on an exam. The twist is that we need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, so cheating is involved here because Roger is looking at someone else's paper, right?\n\nLet me break down each person's situation:\n\n- Alan is guessing randomly with a 1/5 chance of being correct.\n- Roger is cheating, so his probability is 2/3.\n- Peter is doing the work, so his probability is 5/6.\n\nWait, but the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Oh, so we want the scenario where the correct answer is given, but Roger didn't cheat. Because if Roger cheats and gets it right, that's via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The wording says the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So it's about the correctness of the answer, but the method (cheating) wasn't used. So in this case, we need the answer to be correct, but it's not due to Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, no, wait. No, the way the question is phrased, I think it's asking for the probability that the question is correctly answered by any of the three friends, but not because of cheating. So perhaps it's the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly, but not Roger. Or wait, no, because if Roger answers correctly, that's cheating, so we're excluding that scenario.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter. Because if Roger answered correctly, that's via cheating, which we don't want. So the total probability is the sum of the probabilities that either Alan answers correctly, or Peter answers correctly, or both, but Roger doesn't.\n\nWait, but no, because all three are attempting the question. So the way it's structured, each of them is answering the question. So the correct answer is from one of them. But we want the probability that the correct answer is given, but not through Roger's cheating. So the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but no. Wait, the way the problem is set up, all three are attempting the question, but the question is about the entire event of them answering. So perhaps the correct answer is achieved by any of them, but we don't want the case where Roger is the one who answered correctly because that's via cheating. So we're looking for the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nBut wait, no. Let me think again. The problem says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So the correct answer is achieved, but the method used isn't cheating. So we're looking for the cases where either Alan or Peter answers correctly, because Roger's correct answer is via cheating.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right because if all three are answering, then the correct answer could come from any of them. So perhaps the correct answer is given by any of them, but we need to exclude the cases where it's Roger who answered correctly because that's cheating. So the probability that the correct answer comes from Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the overall correctness, regardless of who answered, but we want the correct answer without Roger's cheating. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the three friends are answering the same question, and the question is whether the correct answer is given by someone, but it's not via cheating. So the correct answer is given, but it wasn't via Roger's cheating. So the correct answer could be given by Alan or Peter, but not Roger. So the total probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but not both? Or wait, no, because if both answer correctly, the question is still answered correctly. So perhaps the total probability is the sum of the probabilities that either Alan or Peter is correct, minus the overlap where both are correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's simpler than that. Let me model this as the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, considering that all three are answering. But no, wait, each of them is answering independently, so the correct answer could be given by any of them. But we want the correct answer to have been given by someone who didn't cheat, i.e., Alan or Peter. But wait, the problem says \"but not via cheating,\" which I think refers to the method used, not necessarily the person. But in this case, Roger is the one who's cheating. So if the correct answer is from Roger, that's via cheating, which we don't want. So the probability that the question is answered correctly via Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but in reality, each of them is answering the same question. So perhaps the question is answered correctly by at least one of them, but we're excluding the case where Roger is the one who got it right. So the probability that the question is correctly answered by Alan or Peter, or both.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because if all three answer, the question is considered correctly answered if at least one of them gets it right. But we're to exclude the cases where the correct answer came via cheating, i.e., Roger's correct answer. So the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but if Roger is correct, that's via cheating and we don't count that scenario.\n\nWait, no. The question is: the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, but it's not because of cheating. So, if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, that's acceptable. But if the correct answer is given by Roger, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the three friends are answering the question, and we want the probability that the question is answered correctly by any of them, but not via Roger's cheating. So in other words, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nBut wait, that's not exactly correct. Because if all three are answering, and the question is whether it's answered correctly without cheating, perhaps the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter. So the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, or both. But wait, if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating, so we're excluding that scenario. But wait, the problem is that the correct answer is given, but not via cheating. So perhaps the question is answered correctly, but not by Roger. Because if Roger is the only one who answered correctly, that's via cheating, which we don't want. So the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, or both, but not by Roger. So the total probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, minus the cases where all three answered correctly (since we don't want that), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger. Because if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo the way to compute this is: the probability that the question is correctly answered by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that might not be the right approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the entire event: the correct answer is given, but not via cheating. So the correct answer is achieved through non-cheating means, i.e., either Alan or Peter.\n\nBut how does that work? Because all three are answering the question, and the correct answer could be given by any of them. So the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter is the sum of their probabilities minus the overlap.\n\nBut wait, another approach is to think of the question being answered correctly. The possible scenarios are:\n\n1. Alan answers correctly, others don't.\n2. Roger answers correctly, others don't.\n3. Peter answers correctly, others don't.\n4. Two of them answer correctly.\n5. All three answer correctly.\n\nBut we are to exclude the scenario where Roger answered correctly, whether alone or in combination.\n\nSo the desired probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether the others got it right. Wait, no, because if the correct answer is given by someone else, but Roger also got it right, then that's via cheating, which we don't want. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, and Roger did not answer correctly. Because if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating, which we don't want. So we want the correct answer to be given by Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't answer correctly.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. Because if the question is answered correctly by Alan, then regardless of Roger, that's a correct answer via non-cheating. So perhaps the correct way to compute this is:\n\nProbability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not answer correctly.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. Because the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So if Alan or Peter answers correctly, that's acceptable. But if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all cases. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that the question is answered correctly is equal to the probability that at least one of Alan, Roger, or Peter answered correctly. But we want the probability that it's answered correctly, but not via cheating. So we need the probability that the question is correctly answered, but Roger did not answer correctly. Because if Roger answered correctly, that's via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nSo the desired probability is the probability that the question is answered correctly (by anyone) minus the probability that it's answered correctly by Roger. But wait, no. Because the question is whether the correct answer was given, but not via cheating. So perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger answered correctly or not. But that's not quite right.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, and that Roger did not answer correctly. Because if the question is answered correctly, but it's not via cheating, then Roger must not have answered correctly. So the correct answer comes from Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Because if all three answer correctly, then the question is correctly answered, and we don't want that because it's via cheating (Roger). So the correct approach is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, and not answered correctly by Roger.\n\nWait, but how? Let me try to model this.\n\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan is P(A). Correctly by Roger is P(R). Correctly by Peter is P(P). The events are independent.\n\nWe want the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So that would be the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the event as the question being answered correctly by Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does, but excluding the cases where Roger is the only one who got it right.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, and not answered correctly by Roger.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because if the question is answered correctly by both Alan and Peter, that's still a correct answer, and we want to include that.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way is to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger answers correctly or not, but not including the cases where Roger is the one who answered correctly.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's approach this methodically.\n\nWe need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter.\n\nBut that's not exactly right because the correct answer could be given by multiple people, including Roger. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by at least one of Alan or Peter, and not answered correctly by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right because if the question is answered correctly by both Alan and Peter, but Roger also answers correctly, then that's via cheating, which we don't want. So the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not by Roger. Because if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating, which we want to exclude.\n\nSo the total probability is the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. But wait, no, because if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, so we don't want that. So the correct approach is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, and Roger did not answer correctly.\n\nWait, no, because the question is answered correctly if at least one of them is correct. So the overall probability that the question is answered correctly is P(A \u2228 R \u2228 P). But we want the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So that would be the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, and not answered correctly by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because the question is answered correctly if any of them is correct. So if Alan is correct, the question is correct, regardless of Roger or Peter. But if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer, but subtract the cases where Roger is correct.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's model all possible scenarios and compute the probabilities.\n\nEach of the three can answer correctly or not. The possible cases are:\n\n1. Alan correct, Roger incorrect, Peter incorrect.\n2. Alan correct, Roger incorrect, Peter correct.\n3. Alan correct, Roger correct, Peter incorrect.\n4. Alan correct, Roger correct, Peter correct.\n5. Alan incorrect, Roger correct, Peter incorrect.\n6. Alan incorrect, Roger correct, Peter correct.\n7. Alan incorrect, Roger incorrect, Peter correct.\n8. Alan incorrect, Roger incorrect, Peter incorrect.\n\nBut we're interested in the cases where the question is answered correctly (i.e., at least one correct), but not via cheating (i.e., Roger did not answer correctly).\n\nSo the acceptable cases are those where the question is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo the acceptable cases are:\n\nCase 1: Alan correct, Roger incorrect, Peter incorrect.\nCase 2: Alan correct, Roger incorrect, Peter correct.\nCase 7: Alan incorrect, Roger incorrect, Peter correct.\n\nCase 4: Alan correct, Roger correct, Peter correct. Wait, no, in this case, Roger is correct, so it's via cheating, which we don't want. So this case is excluded.\n\nSimilarly, cases 3 and 5 and 6 involve Roger being correct, so they are excluded.\n\nSo the acceptable cases are 1, 2, and 7.\n\nNow, let's compute the probability for each acceptable case.\n\nCase 1: Alan correct, Roger incorrect, Peter incorrect.\nProbability: (1/5) * (1 - 2/3) * (1 - 5/6) = (1/5) * (1/3) * (1/6) = (1/5)(1/3)(1/6) = 1/(90)\n\nCase 2: Alan correct, Roger incorrect, Peter correct.\nProbability: (1/5) * (1/3) * (5/6) = (1/5)(1/3)(5/6) = (5)/(90) = 1/18\n\nCase 7: Alan incorrect, Roger incorrect, Peter correct.\nProbability: (4/5) * (1/3) * (5/6) = (4/5)(1/3)(5/6) = (4 *5)/(5*3*6) )= (20)/(90) = 2/9\n\nNow, sum these probabilities:\n\n1/90 + 1/18 + 2/9.\n\nLet's convert them to a common denominator of 90.\n\n1/90 is 1/90.\n\n1/18 is 5/90.\n\n2/9 is 20/90.\n\nSo sum is 1 +5 +20 =26 \u2192 26/90.\n\nWait, 26/90 simplifies to 13/45, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, 1/90 +5/90 =6/90 \u2192 6 +20 is 26 \u2192 26/90 \u2192 13/45.\n\nSo the total probability is 13/45.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 13/45.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other cases. Are there any other cases where the question is answered correctly, and Roger is incorrect?\n\nNo, the only cases where the question is answered correctly and Roger is incorrect are cases 1, 2, and 7.\n\nWait, but another way to compute this is: the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating is equal to the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether both are correct, but Roger is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can model it as the probability that (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nSo the formula is P(A \u2228 P) * P(R^c), where R^c is Roger incorrect.\n\nWait, no, because the events are not independent in that way. Wait, no, because (A \u2228 P) and R^c are independent? No, they are not, because R is independent of A and P.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWhich is the same as the sum of the cases where the question is correct and R is incorrect.\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nSo the total probability is 13/45, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. The probability that the question is answered correctly without cheating is the same as the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether both are correct, but Roger is not correct.\n\nSo, the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, let me compute this as:\n\nP(A \u2228 P) * P(R^c) \u2192 but wait, no, because (A \u2228 P) is not independent of R^c. So that approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, and not answered correctly by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct because if the question is answered correctly by both Alan and Peter, and Roger is incorrect, that's acceptable.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, and Roger did not answer correctly.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, and Roger did not answer correctly.\n\nBecause if Roger did not answer correctly, then the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter.\n\nSo the probability is P(Q correct) * P(R^c) ?\n\nWait, no, because Q correct is dependent on R. So the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly and Roger did not answer correctly.\n\nWhich can be written as P(Q correct and R incorrect).\n\nWhich is equal to P(Q correct | R incorrect) * P(R incorrect).\n\nBut P(Q correct | R incorrect) is the probability that Alan or Peter answered correctly, given that Roger didn't. So, given that Roger didn't answer correctly, what's the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly.\n\nBut that's a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me compute P(Q correct and R incorrect) = P(R incorrect) * P(Q correct | R incorrect).\n\nP(R incorrect) is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nP(Q correct | R incorrect) is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly.\n\nSo, given that R is incorrect, the question is correct if A is correct OR P is correct.\n\nSo, P(A correct OR P correct) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P), since A and P are independent.\n\nP(A correct) is 1/5, P(P correct) is 5/6.\n\nSo P(A \u2228 P) = 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = (6/30 +25/30) - (5/30) )= (31/30) - (5/30) = 26/30 = 13/15.\n\nSo P(Q correct | R incorrect) = 13/15.\n\nSo P(Q correct and R incorrect) = (1/3) * (13/15) = 13/(45).\n\nWhich matches the earlier result.\n\nSo the probability is 13/45, which is option E.\n",

So the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, or both, but not by Roger. So the total probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, minus the cases where all three answered correctly (since we don't want that), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger. Because if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo the way to compute this is: the probability that the question is correctly answered by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that might not be the right approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the entire event: the correct answer is given, but not via cheating. So the correct answer is achieved through non-cheating means, i.e., either Alan or Peter.\n\nBut how does that work? Because all three are answering the question, and the correct answer could be given by any of them. So the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter is the sum of their probabilities minus the overlap.\n\nBut wait, another approach is to think of the question being answered correctly. The possible scenarios are:\n\n1. Alan answers correctly, others don't.\n2. Roger answers correctly, others don't.\n3. Peter answers correctly, others don't.\n4. Two of them answer correctly.\n5. All three answer correctly.\n\nBut we are to exclude the scenario where Roger answered correctly, whether alone or in combination.\n\nSo the desired probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether the others got it right. Wait, no, because if the correct answer is given by someone else, but Roger also got it right, then that's via cheating, which we don't want. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, and Roger did not answer correctly. Because if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating, which we don't want. So we want the correct answer to be given by Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't answer correctly.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. Because if the question is answered correctly by Alan, then regardless of Roger, that's a correct answer via non-cheating. So perhaps the correct way to compute this is:\n\nProbability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not answer correctly.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. Because the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So if Alan or Peter answers correctly, that's acceptable. But if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all cases. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that the question is answered correctly is equal to the probability that at least one of Alan, Roger, or Peter answered correctly. But we want the probability that it's answered correctly, but not via cheating. So we need the probability that the question is correctly answered, but Roger did not answer correctly. Because if Roger answered correctly, that's via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nSo the desired probability is the probability that the question is answered correctly (by anyone) minus the probability that it's answered correctly by Roger. But wait, no. Because the question is whether the correct answer was given, but not via cheating. So perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger answered correctly or not. But that's not quite right.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, and that Roger did not answer correctly. Because if the question is answered correctly, but it's not via cheating, then Roger must not have answered correctly. So the correct answer comes from Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Because if all three answer correctly, then the question is correctly answered, and we don't want that because it's via cheating (Roger). So the correct approach is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, and not answered correctly by Roger.\n\nWait, but how? Let me try to model this.\n\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan is P(A). Correctly by Roger is P(R). Correctly by Peter is P(P). The events are independent.\n\nWe want the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So that would be the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the event as the question being answered correctly by Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does, but excluding the cases where Roger is the only one who got it right.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, and not answered correctly by Roger.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because if the question is answered correctly by both Alan and Peter, that's still a correct answer, and we want to include that.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way is to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger answers correctly or not, but not including the cases where Roger is the one who answered correctly.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's approach this methodically.\n\nWe need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter.\n\nBut that's not exactly right because the correct answer could be given by multiple people, including Roger. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by at least one of Alan or Peter, and not answered correctly by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right because if the question is answered correctly by both Alan and Peter, but Roger also answers correctly, then that's via cheating, which we don't want. So the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not by Roger. Because if Roger answers correctly, that's via cheating, which we want to exclude.\n\nSo the total probability is the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. But wait, no, because if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, so we don't want that. So the correct approach is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, and Roger did not answer correctly.\n\nWait, no, because the question is answered correctly if at least one of them is correct. So the overall probability that the question is answered correctly is P(A \u2228 R \u2228 P). But we want the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So that would be the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, and not answered correctly by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because the question is answered correctly if any of them is correct. So if Alan is correct, the question is correct, regardless of Roger or Peter. But if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer, but subtract the cases where Roger is correct.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's model all possible scenarios and compute the probabilities.\n\nEach of the three can answer correctly or not. The possible cases are:\n\n1. Alan correct, Roger incorrect, Peter incorrect.\n2. Alan correct, Roger incorrect, Peter correct.\n3. Alan correct, Roger correct, Peter incorrect.\n4. Alan correct, Roger correct, Peter correct.\n5. Alan incorrect, Roger correct, Peter incorrect.\n6. Alan incorrect, Roger correct, Peter correct.\n7. Alan incorrect, Roger incorrect, Peter correct.\n8. Alan incorrect, Roger incorrect, Peter incorrect.\n\nBut we're interested in the cases where the question is answered correctly (i.e., at least one correct), but not via cheating (i.e., Roger did not answer correctly).\n\nSo the acceptable cases are those where the question is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo the acceptable cases are:\n\nCase 1: Alan correct, Roger incorrect, Peter incorrect.\nCase 2: Alan correct, Roger incorrect, Peter correct.\nCase 7: Alan incorrect, Roger incorrect, Peter correct.\n\nCase 4: Alan correct, Roger correct, Peter correct. Wait, no, in this case, Roger is correct, so it's via cheating, which we don't want. So this case is excluded.\n\nSimilarly, cases 3 and 5 and 6 involve Roger being correct, so they are excluded.\n\nSo the acceptable cases are 1, 2, and 7.\n\nNow, let's compute the probability for each acceptable case.\n\nCase 1: Alan correct, Roger incorrect, Peter incorrect.\nProbability: (1/5) * (1 - 2/3) * (1 - 5/6) = (1/5) * (1/3) * (1/6) = (1/5)(1/3)(1/6) = 1/(90)\n\nCase 2: Alan correct, Roger incorrect, Peter correct.\nProbability: (1/5) * (1/3) * (5/6) = (1/5)(1/3)(5/6) = (5)/(90) = 1/18\n\nCase 7: Alan incorrect, Roger incorrect, Peter correct.\nProbability: (4/5) * (1/3) * (5/6) = (4/5)(1/3)(5/6) = (4 *5)/(5*3*6) )= (20)/(90) = 2/9\n\nNow, sum these probabilities:\n\n1/90 + 1/18 + 2/9.\n\nLet's convert them to a common denominator of 90.\n\n1/90 is 1/90.\n\n1/18 is 5/90.\n\n2/9 is 20/90.\n\nSo sum is 1 +5 +20 =26 \u2192 26/90.\n\nWait, 26/90 simplifies to 13/45, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, 1/90 +5/90 =6/90 \u2192 6 +20 is 26 \u2192 26/90 \u2192 13/45.\n\nSo the total probability is 13/45.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 13/45.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other cases. Are there any other cases where the question is answered correctly, and Roger is incorrect?\n\nNo, the only cases where the question is answered correctly and Roger is incorrect are cases 1, 2, and 7.\n\nWait, but another way to compute this is: the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating is equal to the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether both are correct, but Roger is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can model it as the probability that (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nSo the formula is P(A \u2228 P) * P(R^c), where R^c is Roger incorrect.\n\nWait, no, because the events are not independent in that way. Wait, no, because (A \u2228 P) and R^c are independent? No, they are not, because R is independent of A and P.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWhich is the same as the sum of the cases where the question is correct and R is incorrect.\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nSo the total probability is 13/45, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. The probability that the question is answered correctly without cheating is the same as the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether both are correct, but Roger is not correct.\n\nSo, the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, let me compute this as:\n\nP(A \u2228 P) * P(R^c) \u2192 but wait, no, because (A \u2228 P) is not independent of R^c. So that approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, and not answered correctly by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct because if the question is answered correctly by both Alan and Peter, and Roger is incorrect, that's acceptable.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, and Roger did not answer correctly.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, and Roger did not answer correctly.\n\nBecause if Roger did not answer correctly, then the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter.\n\nSo the probability is P(Q correct) * P(R^c) ?\n\nWait, no, because Q correct is dependent on R. So the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly and Roger did not answer correctly.\n\nWhich can be written as P(Q correct and R incorrect).\n\nWhich is equal to P(Q correct | R incorrect) * P(R incorrect).\n\nBut P(Q correct | R incorrect) is the probability that Alan or Peter answered correctly, given that Roger didn't. So, given that Roger didn't answer correctly, what's the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly.\n\nBut that's a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me compute P(Q correct and R incorrect) = P(R incorrect) * P(Q correct | R incorrect).\n\nP(R incorrect) is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nP(Q correct | R incorrect) is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly.\n\nSo, given that R is incorrect, the question is correct if A is correct OR P is correct.\n\nSo, P(A correct OR P correct) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P), since A and P are independent.\n\nP(A correct) is 1/5, P(P correct) is 5/6.\n\nSo P(A \u2228 P) = 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = (6/30 +25/30) - (5/30) )= (31/30) - (5/30) = 26/30 = 13/15.\n\nSo P(Q correct | R incorrect) = 13/15.\n\nSo P(Q correct and R incorrect) = (1/3) * (13/15) = 13/(45).\n\nWhich matches the earlier result.\n\nSo the probability is 13/45, which is option E.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means we want the question to be answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger, who is cheating.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the probabilities\n- Alan guesses randomly with a probability of answering correctly:  \n  \\( P(A) = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n- Roger cheats with a probability of answering correctly:  \n  \\( P(R) = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n- Peter works diligently with a probability of answering correctly:  \n  \\( P(P) = \\frac{5}{6} \\)\n\n### Step 2: Define the desired event\nWe want the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means:\n- The question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter.\n- Roger does not answer correctly.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the probability that Roger does not answer correctly\nThe probability that Roger does not answer correctly is:  \n\\[\nP(R^c) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter is given by:  \n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:  \n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5}{6} - \\left(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = \\frac{6}{30} + \\frac{25}{30} - \\frac{5}{30} = \\frac{26}{30} = \\frac{13}{15}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Combine the probabilities\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, and Roger does not answer correctly is:  \n\\[\nP(\\text{Question correct and not via cheating}) = P(A \\cup P) \\cdot P(R^c)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:  \n\\[\nP(\\text{Question correct and not via cheating}) = \\frac{13}{15} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{13}{45}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating is:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{13}{45}}\n\\]\n\n**Answer: E**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of questions, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nThere are three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. They each attempt to answer a question on an exam, but they have different probabilities of getting it right. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. Hmm, wait, so we're looking for the cases where the correct answer is achieved without cheating. That means we need to consider the cases where either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger through cheating. Or wait, no, because Roger's method is cheating. So the correct answer could be due to either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger's cheating. Wait, no, the question is about the overall correct answer, but not via cheating. So the scenario is: the question is correct, but the reason it's correct isn't because of Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the method used was not cheating. So that would include Alan's correct guess and Peter's correct calculation, but exclude Roger's correct answer because he cheated. Wait, but I'm not sure. Wait, the question says \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So that would be the cases where the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So the correct answer could be from either Alan or Peter. Because Roger cheated, so if he got it right, that's via cheating. So we need the cases where either Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't. Or wait, no, because the question is about the overall correctness, regardless of who answered. Wait, perhaps the friends are answering independently, and we're to find the probability that the answer is correct but not because of Roger's cheating. So that would mean that the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again. The friends attempt to answer the question, and we're looking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer came via either Alan guessing or Peter's calculations, but not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is due to either Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that all three are answering, and the question is whether the correct answer is achieved by someone, but without Roger's cheating being the method. Hmm. Or perhaps, the question is about the probability that the correct answer is given, but that it's not because of cheating. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model this as the probability that the answer is correct, but it's not due to Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. But that's not entirely correct, because if Roger gets it right, that's via cheating, so the correct answer is via cheating. So the correct answer not via cheating would be when either Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the question is about the probability that the answer is correct, but the method was not cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. Wait, but maybe all three are answering, and the question is correct if at least one of them answered correctly, but not via cheating. No, that's not right because the problem says \"the question is answered correctly\", which I think refers to the answer being correct, regardless of who answered it. But the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again. The question is: what is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by someone, but the method used was not cheating. So that means, the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter. So the correct answer is either Alan got it right (1/5 chance) or Peter got it right (5/6 chance). But we need to account for the possibility that more than one person got it right, but we're only concerned about the correct answer being via non-cheating methods.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way to approach this is to calculate the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter got it right, minus the probability that Roger didn't contribute. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is considered to be when the answer is correct regardless of who got it right, but the method used wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer could have come from Alan or Peter. So the total probability would be the sum of the probabilities that either Alan or Peter got it right, minus the overlap where both got it right. But wait, no, because the question is about the event that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods, regardless of whether others also got it right.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the question is more about the correct answer being achieved, and that the correct answer is not via cheating. So, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. So, the event is that the correct answer is given, and it's via either Alan or Peter. So, perhaps the way to compute this is to find the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, but Roger didn't. Because if Roger got it right, that's via cheating, so the correct answer is via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct answer must come from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because the correct answer could be given by both Alan and Peter, but Roger didn't. Or by only one of them. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is considered as the correct answer regardless of who provided it, but we're to find the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So, that would be the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of Roger's result, but only considering that the correct answer was achieved without cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to find the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and that Roger did not answer correctly via cheating. Because if Roger answered correctly, that would be via cheating, so the correct answer is via cheating, which we are excluding.\n\nSo, to clarify, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger did not answer correctly. Because if Roger did answer correctly, that's via cheating, so the correct answer is via cheating, which we don't want. So the correct answer must be via Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nWait, but that's not correct, because the correct answer could be given by both Alan and Peter, or just one, and Roger might have also gotten it right. But in any case, as long as the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result, the correct answer is via non-cheating. But the problem says \"but not via cheating\". So perhaps, the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods, regardless of whether others cheated and got it right.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of it as the question being answered correctly, but the method was not cheating. So the correct answer could have come from either Alan or Peter. So the probability is the probability that either Alan got it right, or Peter got it right, or both. But wait, that's not considering the case where Roger cheated and got it right. No, because if the correct answer is achieved via cheating, that's the case we're excluding. So the correct answer must be achieved via Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. Because the correct answer is that the question is answered correctly, but the method used was not cheating. So, the correct answer could be via Alan, or via Peter, or via both. But if the correct answer is via Roger's cheating, that's the scenario we want to exclude. So, the probability we're looking for is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, minus any overlap where Roger's cheating also contributed to the correct answer.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model it as the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. But wait, no. Because the correct answer could be given by all three, but we're to find the cases where the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, which would be Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. But wait, perhaps the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not both? No, that's not right. Because if both Alan and Peter got it right, that's still correct, and it's via non-cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the answer is correct, and that it's not Roger who got it right. So, the correct answer could be from Alan, Peter, or both. So the probability is (probability Alan is correct) + (probability Peter is correct) - (probability both are correct). But wait, that's the probability that at least one of them is correct. But we also need to consider that Roger could have gotten it right, but his method is cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, no. The problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer is achieved, but not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be via Alan or Peter. So, the event is that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right. So, we're looking for the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and that the correct answer is not via cheating. So, the correct answer is via Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. But wait, no, because even if Roger got it right, the correct answer is via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct answer must be via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right. Hmm, but that's not possible because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, then the correct answer is correct regardless of Roger.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and that Roger's answer is incorrect. Because if Roger got it right, that's via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer must be via Alan or Peter, but Roger must have gotten it wrong.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if the correct answer is given via Alan or Peter, but Roger didn't get it right, then the correct answer is via non-cheating. But if Roger got it right, then the correct answer is via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the scenario we want is that either Alan got it right, or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because the correct answer is achieved when at least one of them got it right, but we need to exclude the cases where the correct answer came via cheating. So, if the correct answer came via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right, but if the correct answer came via Roger, that's via cheating, so we have to exclude that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result. So, the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter is P(Alan correct) + P(Peter correct) - P(Alan correct and Peter correct). But wait, no, because the correct answer could be given by either or both, but we have to consider whether the method was cheating or not.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by considering all possible cases and compute the probability accordingly.\n\nLet me list the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Alan correct, Roger correct, Peter correct: this would mean the correct answer is via cheating (Roger) and via others, but we want to exclude the cheating method.\n\nWait, no, the correct answer is correct regardless. But the method by which the correct answer was achieved could be via cheating or not. So, the event we want is that the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether others also got it right. But I'm getting a bit tangled here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and that Roger did not give the correct answer. Because if Roger gives the correct answer, that's via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if the correct answer is achieved via Roger, that's via cheating, which we're excluding. So the correct answer must come from Alan or Peter, and Roger's answer must be wrong.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't. So, that would be:\n\nP(Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nBut wait, no. Because if either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect, then the correct answer is via non-cheating. But what if both Alan and Peter are correct, and Roger is incorrect? That's still acceptable because the correct answer is via non-cheating.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased is a bit ambiguous. The question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, and it's via non-cheating. So, the correct answer is via Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. So, the correct answer could be via Alan, via Peter, via both, or via neither. Wait, no, because if the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger, then the correct answer is via non-cheating.\n\nWait, no. Let me think of it as the correct answer is given by someone, and the method is not cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. So, the event is that the correct answer is given by Alan OR Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right.\n\nBut wait, how do we model that? Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, that's still correct and via non-cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's also given by Roger. So, the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter is P(Alan correct) + P(Peter correct) - P(Alan correct and Peter correct). But that would be the probability that at least one of them got it right. But in this case, we also need to consider that the correct answer is via non-cheating, which is already the case if it's via Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but that's not considering Roger's role. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right. But that's not quite right because the correct answer is achieved, and whether it's via cheating or not.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is considered as correct regardless of who got it right, but we're to find the cases where the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer must be given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right. So, the probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, plus the cases where all three got it right, but not considering the cases where only Roger got it right.\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated. Maybe it's better to model the problem as follows:\n\nThe question is answered correctly, but the method used wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer was achieved via either Alan's guessing (1/5) or Peter's calculation (5/6). So, we need to calculate the probability that the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's action.\n\nWait, but the problem is that if Roger also got it right via cheating, that's via cheating, which we don't want. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and that the correct answer isn't achieved via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nWait, no, because even if Roger got it right, the correct answer is via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct answer must come from either Alan or Peter, and Roger must have gotten it wrong.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, and Roger got it wrong, then the correct answer is via non-cheating. If the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and Roger got it right, then the correct answer is via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's think about all the possible ways the correct answer can be achieved. The correct answer can be achieved by Alan, Roger, Peter, or any combination of them.\n\nWe are to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer must be achieved via Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So, the correct answer must have come from either Alan or Peter, and not from Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate because if the correct answer is achieved via both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer is via cheating (from Roger) and via guessing (from Alan), but we want to exclude the cheating method. So, the correct answer must be achieved via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also achieved it.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it as the correct answer being given by someone, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and that's it. So, the probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter got it right.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't account for the cases where only Roger got it right, which would be via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating if either Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of whether Roger also got it right. So, the probability is the probability that Alan or Peter got it right.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the correct answer could also be achieved by all three. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, and the method was not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter got the answer correct.\n\nBut then, what about the cases where Roger got it right? Because if Roger got it right, that's via cheating, which is excluded. So, the correct answer is via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer must not come from Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, it's correct regardless of what Roger did. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger's answer is irrelevant except that if he got it right, that's via cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right. Because if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, that's via non-cheating, even if Roger also got it right via cheating.\n\nBut the problem says \"but not via cheating\", so perhaps the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer must be achieved via Alan or Peter, and not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger did not get it right.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if the correct answer is achieved via Roger, that's via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct answer must be achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nSo, the scenario is: (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nSo, to compute this probability, we can use the formula:\n\nP = P(Alan correct OR Peter correct) \u00d7 P(Roger incorrect)\n\nWait, no, because (Alan correct OR Peter correct) and Roger incorrect are independent events? Are they independent?\n\nWait, the events are independent because each person's result is independent of the others.\n\nSo, the probability that (Alan correct OR Peter correct) is P_A + P_P - P_A * P_P, since Alan and Peter's correctness are independent.\n\nBut wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe probability that either Alan or Peter got it right is P_A + P_P - P_A * P_P.\n\nBut then, we also need to multiply by the probability that Roger didn't get it right. Because the scenario is that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nWait, no, because if the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right, then the correct answer is via non-cheating. But if the correct answer is given by both Alan or Peter and Roger, then the correct answer is via cheating (Roger), which we're excluding.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to model it properly.\n\nWe need to find the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and that the correct answer is not given via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, but how can the correct answer not be given by Roger? The correct answer is correct, regardless of who got it. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's also given by Roger.\n\nBut then, the correct answer could be given by all three, but as long as it's given by Alan or Peter, the method is non-cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by at least one of Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's also given by Roger. Because the correct answer is correct regardless of who got it, and the method is not cheating if it's Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter got it right.\n\nSo, P = P_A + P_P - P_A * P_P.\n\nWhere P_A is 1/5, and P_P is 5/6.\n\nSo, P = (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/5)(5/6) = ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is approx 0.8333.\n\nSo, 0.2 + 0.8333 = 1.0333.\n\nBut then subtract 0.2 * 0.8333 = 0.16666.\n\nSo, 1.0333 - 0.16666 = approx 0.8666, which is 5/6 + 1/5 - (1/5 *5/6) = (6 +5 - (5/6)) /5? Hmm, perhaps it's better to compute it as fractions.\n\n1/5 + 5/6 = (6 + 25)/30 = 31/30.\n\nWait, wait, no, that's not correct. Because 1/5 is 6/30, and 5/6 is 25/30. So, 6/30 +25/30 = 31/30. But then, we subtract the overlap, which is (1/5)*(5/6) = (1*5)/(5*6) = 5/30 = 1/6.\n\nSo, 31/30 - 1/6.\n\nConvert 1/6 to 5/30.\n\n31/30 -5/30=26/30=13/15.\n\nWait, but that's the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter got it right. But that's 13/15.\n\nBut looking at the options, I don't see 13/15 as an option. The options are A)1/18, B)1/9, C)23/90, D)5/18, E)13/45.\n\nHmm, 13/15 isn't among them. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nSo, the probability would be [P(Alan correct) + P(Peter correct) - P(Alan correct)*P(Peter correct)] * P(Roger incorrect).\n\nBecause the events are independent.\n\nSo, P(Roger incorrect) is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, the probability is [ (1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6)) ] * (1/3).\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute (1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6)).\n\nWhich is (6/30 +25/30 - (5/30)) = (6 +25 -5)/30 = 26/30 =13/15.\n\nMultiply by 1/3: 13/15 *1/3 =13/45.\n\nAh, 13/45 is option E.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be E)13/45.\n\nWait, but why did I multiply by P(Roger incorrect)?\n\nBecause we want the correct answer to be achieved via Alan or Peter, and not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger's answer is incorrect.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because even if Roger got it right, the correct answer is via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and that Roger didn't get it right.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate. Because if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result, then the correct answer is via non-cheating. But if the correct answer is given by Roger, that's via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nSo, the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right. Because the correct answer is correct via non-cheating methods if it's given by Alan or Peter.\n\nBut then, the calculation would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, which is 13/15, as I computed earlier. But that's not among the options. So, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and that Roger didn't get it right. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nIn that case, the probability would be:\n\nP(Alan correct OR Peter correct) \u00d7 P(Roger incorrect).\n\nWhich is (13/15) \u00d7 (1/3) =13/45.\n\nWhich is option E.\n\nBut why do we need to multiply by P(Roger incorrect)? Because if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but Roger also got it right via cheating, then the correct answer is via cheating, which we're excluding. So, we want the correct answer to be given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWhich is (P_A + P_P - P_A*P_P) \u00d7 (1 - P_R), where P_R is Roger's probability of being correct (2/3).\n\nSo, (1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6)) \u00d7 (1/3).\n\nWhich equals ( (6+25 -5)/30 ) \u00d7 (1/3) = (26/30) \u00d7 (1/3) = (13/15) \u00d7 (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nSo, the answer is E)13/45.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, we need to consider the scenarios where the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and exclude cases where the correct answer is achieved via Roger's cheating.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of questions, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nThere are three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. They each attempt to answer a question on an exam, but they have different probabilities of getting it right. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. Hmm, wait, so we're looking for the cases where the correct answer is achieved without cheating. That means we need to consider the cases where either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger through cheating. Or wait, no, because Roger's method is cheating. So the correct answer could be due to either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger's cheating. Wait, no, the question is about the overall correct answer, but not via cheating. So the scenario is: the question is correct, but the reason it's correct isn't because of Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the method used was not cheating. So that would include Alan's correct guess and Peter's correct calculation, but exclude Roger's correct answer because he cheated. Wait, but I'm not sure. Wait, the question says \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So that would be the cases where the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So the correct answer could be from either Alan or Peter. Because Roger cheated, so if he got it right, that's via cheating. So we need the cases where either Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't. Or wait, no, because the question is about the overall correctness, regardless of who answered. Wait, perhaps the friends are answering independently, and we're to find the probability that the answer is correct but not because of Roger's cheating. So that would mean that the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again. The friends attempt to answer the question, and we're looking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer came via either Alan guessing or Peter's calculations, but not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is due to either Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that all three are answering, and the question is whether the correct answer is achieved by someone, but without Roger's cheating being the method. Hmm. Or perhaps, the question is about the probability that the correct answer is given, but that it's not because of cheating. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model this as the probability that the answer is correct, but it's not due to Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. But that's not entirely correct, because if Roger gets it right, that's via cheating, so the correct answer is via cheating. So the correct answer not via cheating would be when either Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the question is about the probability that the answer is correct, but the method was not cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. Wait, but maybe all three are answering, and the question is correct if at least one of them answered correctly, but not via cheating. No, that's not right because the problem says \"the question is answered correctly\", which I think refers to the answer being correct, regardless of who answered it. But the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again. The question is: what is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by someone, but the method used was not cheating. So that means, the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter. So the correct answer is either Alan got it right (1/5 chance) or Peter got it right (5/6 chance). But we need to account for the possibility that more than one person got it right, but we're only concerned about the correct answer being via non-cheating methods.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way to approach this is to calculate the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter got it right, minus the probability that Roger didn't contribute. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is considered to be when the answer is correct regardless of who got it right, but the method used wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer could have come from Alan or Peter. So the total probability would be the sum of the probabilities that either Alan or Peter got it right, minus the overlap where both got it right. But wait, no, because the question is about the event that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods, regardless of whether others also got it right.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the question is more about the correct answer being achieved, and that the correct answer is not via cheating. So, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. So, the event is that the correct answer is given, and it's via either Alan or Peter. So, perhaps the way to compute this is to find the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, but Roger didn't. Because if Roger got it right, that's via cheating, so the correct answer is via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct answer must come from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because the correct answer could be given by both Alan and Peter, but Roger didn't. Or by only one of them. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is considered as the correct answer regardless of who provided it, but we're to find the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So, that would be the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of Roger's result, but only considering that the correct answer was achieved without cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to find the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and that Roger did not answer correctly via cheating. Because if Roger answered correctly, that would be via cheating, so the correct answer is via cheating, which we are excluding.\n\nSo, to clarify, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger did not answer correctly. Because if Roger did answer correctly, that's via cheating, so the correct answer is via cheating, which we don't want. So the correct answer must be via Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nWait, but that's not correct, because the correct answer could be given by both Alan and Peter, or just one, and Roger might have also gotten it right. But in any case, as long as the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result, the correct answer is via non-cheating. But the problem says \"but not via cheating\". So perhaps, the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods, regardless of whether others cheated and got it right.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of it as the question being answered correctly, but the method was not cheating. So the correct answer could have come from either Alan or Peter. So the probability is the probability that either Alan got it right, or Peter got it right, or both. But wait, that's not considering the case where Roger cheated and got it right. No, because if the correct answer is achieved via cheating, that's the case we're excluding. So the correct answer must be achieved via Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. Because the correct answer is that the question is answered correctly, but the method used was not cheating. So, the correct answer could be via Alan, or via Peter, or via both. But if the correct answer is via Roger's cheating, that's the scenario we want to exclude. So, the probability we're looking for is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, minus any overlap where Roger's cheating also contributed to the correct answer.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model it as the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. But wait, no. Because the correct answer could be given by all three, but we're to find the cases where the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, which would be Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. But wait, perhaps the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not both? No, that's not right. Because if both Alan and Peter got it right, that's still correct, and it's via non-cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the answer is correct, and that it's not Roger who got it right. So, the correct answer could be from Alan, Peter, or both. So the probability is (probability Alan is correct) + (probability Peter is correct) - (probability both are correct). But wait, that's the probability that at least one of them is correct. But we also need to consider that Roger could have gotten it right, but his method is cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, no. The problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer is achieved, but not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be via Alan or Peter. So, the event is that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right. So, we're looking for the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and that the correct answer is not via cheating. So, the correct answer is via Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. But wait, no, because even if Roger got it right, the correct answer is via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct answer must be via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right. Hmm, but that's not possible because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, then the correct answer is correct regardless of Roger.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and that Roger's answer is incorrect. Because if Roger got it right, that's via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer must be via Alan or Peter, but Roger must have gotten it wrong.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if the correct answer is given via Alan or Peter, but Roger didn't get it right, then the correct answer is via non-cheating. But if Roger got it right, then the correct answer is via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the scenario we want is that either Alan got it right, or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because the correct answer is achieved when at least one of them got it right, but we need to exclude the cases where the correct answer came via cheating. So, if the correct answer came via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right, but if the correct answer came via Roger, that's via cheating, so we have to exclude that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result. So, the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter is P(Alan correct) + P(Peter correct) - P(Alan correct and Peter correct). But wait, no, because the correct answer could be given by either or both, but we have to consider whether the method was cheating or not.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by considering all possible cases and compute the probability accordingly.\n\nLet me list the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Alan correct, Roger correct, Peter correct: this would mean the correct answer is via cheating (Roger) and via others, but we want to exclude the cheating method.\n\nWait, no, the correct answer is correct regardless. But the method by which the correct answer was achieved could be via cheating or not. So, the event we want is that the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether others also got it right. But I'm getting a bit tangled here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and that Roger did not give the correct answer. Because if Roger gives the correct answer, that's via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if the correct answer is achieved via Roger, that's via cheating, which we're excluding. So the correct answer must come from Alan or Peter, and Roger's answer must be wrong.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't. So, that would be:\n\nP(Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nBut wait, no. Because if either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect, then the correct answer is via non-cheating. But what if both Alan and Peter are correct, and Roger is incorrect? That's still acceptable because the correct answer is via non-cheating.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased is a bit ambiguous. The question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, and it's via non-cheating. So, the correct answer is via Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. So, the correct answer could be via Alan, via Peter, via both, or via neither. Wait, no, because if the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger, then the correct answer is via non-cheating.\n\nWait, no. Let me think of it as the correct answer is given by someone, and the method is not cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. So, the event is that the correct answer is given by Alan OR Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right.\n\nBut wait, how do we model that? Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, that's still correct and via non-cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's also given by Roger. So, the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter is P(Alan correct) + P(Peter correct) - P(Alan correct and Peter correct). But that would be the probability that at least one of them got it right. But in this case, we also need to consider that the correct answer is via non-cheating, which is already the case if it's via Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but that's not considering Roger's role. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right. But that's not quite right because the correct answer is achieved, and whether it's via cheating or not.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is considered as correct regardless of who got it right, but we're to find the cases where the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer must be given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right. So, the probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, plus the cases where all three got it right, but not considering the cases where only Roger got it right.\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated. Maybe it's better to model the problem as follows:\n\nThe question is answered correctly, but the method used wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer was achieved via either Alan's guessing (1/5) or Peter's calculation (5/6). So, we need to calculate the probability that the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's action.\n\nWait, but the problem is that if Roger also got it right via cheating, that's via cheating, which we don't want. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and that the correct answer isn't achieved via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nWait, no, because even if Roger got it right, the correct answer is via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct answer must come from either Alan or Peter, and Roger must have gotten it wrong.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, and Roger got it wrong, then the correct answer is via non-cheating. If the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and Roger got it right, then the correct answer is via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's think about all the possible ways the correct answer can be achieved. The correct answer can be achieved by Alan, Roger, Peter, or any combination of them.\n\nWe are to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer must be achieved via Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So, the correct answer must have come from either Alan or Peter, and not from Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate because if the correct answer is achieved via both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer is via cheating (from Roger) and via guessing (from Alan), but we want to exclude the cheating method. So, the correct answer must be achieved via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also achieved it.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it as the correct answer being given by someone, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and that's it. So, the probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter got it right.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't account for the cases where only Roger got it right, which would be via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating if either Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of whether Roger also got it right. So, the probability is the probability that Alan or Peter got it right.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the correct answer could also be achieved by all three. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, and the method was not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter got the answer correct.\n\nBut then, what about the cases where Roger got it right? Because if Roger got it right, that's via cheating, which is excluded. So, the correct answer is via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer must not come from Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, it's correct regardless of what Roger did. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger's answer is irrelevant except that if he got it right, that's via cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right. Because if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, that's via non-cheating, even if Roger also got it right via cheating.\n\nBut the problem says \"but not via cheating\", so perhaps the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer must be achieved via Alan or Peter, and not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger did not get it right.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if the correct answer is achieved via Roger, that's via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct answer must be achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nSo, the scenario is: (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nSo, to compute this probability, we can use the formula:\n\nP = P(Alan correct OR Peter correct) \u00d7 P(Roger incorrect)\n\nWait, no, because (Alan correct OR Peter correct) and Roger incorrect are independent events? Are they independent?\n\nWait, the events are independent because each person's result is independent of the others.\n\nSo, the probability that (Alan correct OR Peter correct) is P_A + P_P - P_A * P_P, since Alan and Peter's correctness are independent.\n\nBut wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe probability that either Alan or Peter got it right is P_A + P_P - P_A * P_P.\n\nBut then, we also need to multiply by the probability that Roger didn't get it right. Because the scenario is that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nWait, no, because if the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right, then the correct answer is via non-cheating. But if the correct answer is given by both Alan or Peter and Roger, then the correct answer is via cheating (Roger), which we're excluding.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to model it properly.\n\nWe need to find the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and that the correct answer is not given via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, but how can the correct answer not be given by Roger? The correct answer is correct, regardless of who got it. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's also given by Roger.\n\nBut then, the correct answer could be given by all three, but as long as it's given by Alan or Peter, the method is non-cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by at least one of Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's also given by Roger. Because the correct answer is correct regardless of who got it, and the method is not cheating if it's Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter got it right.\n\nSo, P = P_A + P_P - P_A * P_P.\n\nWhere P_A is 1/5, and P_P is 5/6.\n\nSo, P = (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/5)(5/6) = ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is approx 0.8333.\n\nSo, 0.2 + 0.8333 = 1.0333.\n\nBut then subtract 0.2 * 0.8333 = 0.16666.\n\nSo, 1.0333 - 0.16666 = approx 0.8666, which is 5/6 + 1/5 - (1/5 *5/6) = (6 +5 - (5/6)) /5? Hmm, perhaps it's better to compute it as fractions.\n\n1/5 + 5/6 = (6 + 25)/30 = 31/30.\n\nWait, wait, no, that's not correct. Because 1/5 is 6/30, and 5/6 is 25/30. So, 6/30 +25/30 = 31/30. But then, we subtract the overlap, which is (1/5)*(5/6) = (1*5)/(5*6) = 5/30 = 1/6.\n\nSo, 31/30 - 1/6.\n\nConvert 1/6 to 5/30.\n\n31/30 -5/30=26/30=13/15.\n\nWait, but that's the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter got it right. But that's 13/15.\n\nBut looking at the options, I don't see 13/15 as an option. The options are A)1/18, B)1/9, C)23/90, D)5/18, E)13/45.\n\nHmm, 13/15 isn't among them. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nSo, the probability would be [P(Alan correct) + P(Peter correct) - P(Alan correct)*P(Peter correct)] * P(Roger incorrect).\n\nBecause the events are independent.\n\nSo, P(Roger incorrect) is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, the probability is [ (1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6)) ] * (1/3).\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute (1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6)).\n\nWhich is (6/30 +25/30 - (5/30)) = (6 +25 -5)/30 = 26/30 =13/15.\n\nMultiply by 1/3: 13/15 *1/3 =13/45.\n\nAh, 13/45 is option E.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be E)13/45.\n\nWait, but why did I multiply by P(Roger incorrect)?\n\nBecause we want the correct answer to be achieved via Alan or Peter, and not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, and Roger's answer is incorrect.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because even if Roger got it right, the correct answer is via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and that Roger didn't get it right.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate. Because if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result, then the correct answer is via non-cheating. But if the correct answer is given by Roger, that's via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nSo, the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right. Because the correct answer is correct via non-cheating methods if it's given by Alan or Peter.\n\nBut then, the calculation would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, which is 13/15, as I computed earlier. But that's not among the options. So, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and that Roger didn't get it right. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nIn that case, the probability would be:\n\nP(Alan correct OR Peter correct) \u00d7 P(Roger incorrect).\n\nWhich is (13/15) \u00d7 (1/3) =13/45.\n\nWhich is option E.\n\nBut why do we need to multiply by P(Roger incorrect)? Because if the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but Roger also got it right via cheating, then the correct answer is via cheating, which we're excluding. So, we want the correct answer to be given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWhich is (P_A + P_P - P_A*P_P) \u00d7 (1 - P_R), where P_R is Roger's probability of being correct (2/3).\n\nSo, (1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6)) \u00d7 (1/3).\n\nWhich equals ( (6+25 -5)/30 ) \u00d7 (1/3) = (26/30) \u00d7 (1/3) = (13/15) \u00d7 (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nSo, the answer is E)13/45.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, we need to consider the scenarios where the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and exclude cases where the correct answer is achieved via Roger's cheating. The events are independent, so we can calculate the probabilities accordingly.\n\n### Step 1: Probability of Correct Answers\n- **Alan's probability of being correct**: \\( P_A = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n- **Peter's probability of being correct**: \\( P_P = \\frac{5}{6} \\)\n- **Roger's probability of being correct**: \\( P_R = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n- **Roger's probability of being incorrect**: \\( P_{\\text{not } R} = 1 - P_R = \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n\n### Step 2: Probability of Correct Answer via Alan or Peter\nThe probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter is given by:\n\\[\nP(\\text{Alan or Peter correct}) = P_A + P_P - P_A \\cdot P_P\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nP(\\text{Alan or Peter correct}) = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5}{6} - \\left(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nP(\\text{Alan or Peter correct}) = \\frac{6}{30} + \\frac{25}{30} - \\frac{5}{30}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(\\text{Alan or Peter correct}) = \\frac{26}{30} = \\frac{13}{15}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Exclude Cases Where Roger Cheats\nTo ensure the correct answer is not via cheating, we multiply the probability of the correct answer being achieved by Alan or Peter by the probability that Roger did not answer correctly:\n\\[\nP(\\text{Correct, not via cheating}) = P(\\text{Alan or Peter correct}) \\cdot P_{\\text{not } R}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(\\text{Correct, not via cheating}) = \\frac{13}{15} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(\\text{Correct, not via cheating}) = \\frac{13}{45}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is:\n\n**Answer: E**",
