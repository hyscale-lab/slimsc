      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about three bells ringing at different intervals, and I need to figure out when they'll all ring together again. Hmm, let's see. The intervals are 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds. They start together, and I need to find the next time they coincide.\n\nI remember that when dealing with events happening at regular intervals, the key is to find the least common multiple, or LCM, of those intervals. The LCM will give the smallest time after which all three events happen together again. Right, so I should calculate the LCM of 36, 40, and 48.\n\nWait, how do I find the LCM of three numbers again? Oh, right, I can break each number down into its prime factors and then take the highest power of each prime that appears in any of the factorizations. Then multiply those together.\n\nLet me factor each number:\n\n36: Let's see, 36 divided by 2 is 18, divided by 2 again is 9, which is 3 squared. So 36 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b2.\n\n40: Divided by 2 is 20, divided by 2 is 10, divided by 2 is 5, which is prime. So 40 is 2\u00b3 \u00d7 5\u00b9.\n\n48: Divided by 2 is 24, divided by 2 is 12, again by 2 is 6, and again by 2 is 3. So 48 is 2\u2074 \u00d7 3\u00b9.\n\nNow, for the LCM, I take the highest exponent for each prime number present in the factors.\n\nPrimes involved are 2, 3, and 5.\n\nFor 2: the highest exponent is 4 (from 48).\nFor 3: the highest exponent is 2 (from 36).\nFor 5: the highest exponent is 1 (from 40).\n\nSo LCM = 2\u2074 \u00d7 3\u00b2 \u00d7 5\u00b9.\n\nCalculating that: 2\u2074 is 16, 3\u00b2 is 9, and 5 is 5.\n\nSo 16 \u00d7 9 is 144, and 144 \u00d75 is 720. Wait, wait, 144 times 5. Let me compute that again. 100 \u00d75 is 500, 40\u00d75=200, 4\u00d75=20. 500+200=700, plus 20 is 720. Yep, 720 seconds.\n\nWait, but the options are in minutes. Oh right, so 720 seconds divided by 60 is 12 minutes. Because 60 seconds in a minute, so 720 /60 = 12. So the answer should be 12 minutes, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me make sure I did the LCM correctly.\n\nAlternative approach: find the LCM of 36 and 40 first, then find the LCM of that result with 48.\n\nSo, LCM(36,40). Let's see:\n\n36: 2\u00b2 \u00d73\u00b2.\n\n40: 2\u00b3 \u00d75.\n\nSo LCM is max exponents: 2\u00b3, 3\u00b2, 5. So 8 \u00d79 \u00d75 = 360 seconds.\n\nNow, find LCM of 360 and 48.\n\n360: let's factor it. 360 = 36 \u00d710 = (2\u00b2\u00d73\u00b2) \u00d7 (2\u00d75) = 2\u00b3\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75.\n\n48 is 2\u2074\u00d73.\n\nSo for LCM of 360 and 48, take max exponents:\n\n2\u2074, 3\u00b2, 5. So 16 \u00d79 \u00d75 = 720. Yep, same as before.\n\nSo 720 seconds is 12 minutes. Looking at the options, option B is 12 minutes. So the answer is B.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step. Another way to think about it: when do all three ring together again? It's the first time when all three intervals have completed an integer number of rings. So the time t must be a multiple of 36, 40, and 48. The smallest such t is the LCM.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the LCM is 720 seconds, which is 12 minutes. So option B is correct. So I think the answer is B.\n",
