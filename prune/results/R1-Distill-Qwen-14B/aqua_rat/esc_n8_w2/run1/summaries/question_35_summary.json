      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rectangular solid inscribed in a sphere. The solid has dimensions 3 x 4 x 15, and all eight of its vertices are on the sphere. The question is asking for the diameter of the sphere. Hmm, I remember that when a rectangular solid is inscribed in a sphere, the sphere's diameter is equal to the solid's space diagonal. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me think through this carefully.\n\nAlright, first things first. A rectangular solid, also known as a rectangular prism, has length, width, and height. In this case, those are 3, 4, and 15 units respectively. Now, the space diagonal of a rectangular prism is the longest diagonal that stretches from one corner of the prism to the opposite corner, passing through the interior of the prism. I think the formula for the space diagonal (d) is derived from the Pythagorean theorem extended to three dimensions. So, the formula should be d = sqrt(l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. The length is 3, so 3 squared is 9. The width is 4, so 4 squared is 16. The height is 15, so 15 squared is 225. Adding those together: 9 + 16 = 25, and 25 + 225 = 250. So, d = sqrt(250). Wait, what's sqrt(250)? I know that sqrt(256) is 16, so sqrt(250) must be a bit less than 16. Alternatively, I can factor 250: it's 25 * 10, so sqrt(25 *10) is 5*sqrt(10). Oh right, because sqrt(25) is 5, and sqrt(10) is about 3.1623.\n\nSo 5*3.1623 is approximately 15.8115. Wait, but that's the space diagonal, which is the diameter of the sphere. So the diameter would be about 15.8115 units. Looking back at the options, let me check the choices.\n\nOption B is 15.8113. That's really close to what I calculated. So the answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recalculate the squares: 3\u00b2 is 9, 4\u00b2 is 16, 15\u00b2 is 225. Adding them: 9 + 16 is 25, plus 225 is 250. Yep, that's right. So sqrt(250) is the space diagonal, which is the diameter. So yes, the diameter is approximately 15.8113. So the correct answer is B.\n",
