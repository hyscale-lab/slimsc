      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Vinit buying an article during a sale. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question says that there's a 20% discount on all articles, and Vinit bought one for Rs.4578. The question is asking for the actual selling price of the article. Wait, that's a bit confusing. If Vinit bought it for Rs.4578 during the sale, that should be the discounted price, right? So the actual selling price before the discount would be higher. Hmm, I think I got it. So the Rs.4578 is the price after a 20% discount. I need to find the original price before the discount was applied.\n\nLet me think about how discounts work. If there's a 20% discount, that means Vinit paid 80% of the original price. Because 100% minus 20% discount is 80%. So the selling price (which is Rs.4578) is 80% of the original price. Let me denote the original price as 'x'. So, 80% of x equals 4578.\n\nMathematically, that's 0.8 * x = 4578. To find x, I can rearrange the equation. x equals 4578 divided by 0.8. Let me calculate that. 4578 divided by 0.8 is the same as 4578 multiplied by 1.25, because dividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 5/4 or 1.25. Let me do that multiplication.\n\n4578 * 1.25. Hmm, 4578 * 1 is 4578, and 4578 * 0.25 is, well, a quarter of 4578. Let me compute that. 4578 divided by 4 is 1144.5. So adding that to 4578 gives me 4578 + 1144.5. Let's add them. 4578 + 1000 is 5578, then plus 144.5 makes 5722.5. Wait, but the options are in whole numbers. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check the calculation. Let me compute 4578 divided by 0.8 again. Another way to think about it is moving the decimal point. 4578 divided by 0.8 is the same as 45780 divided by 8. Let me do that division.\n\n45780 divided by 8. 8 goes into 45 five times (5*8=40), remainder 5. Bring down the 7 to make 57. 8 goes into 57 seven times (7*8=56), remainder 1. Bring down the 8 to make 18. 8 goes into 18 two times (2*8=16), remainder 2. Bring down the 0. 8 goes into 20 two times (2*8=16), remainder 4. Bring down the next 0, making 40. 8 goes into 40 exactly 5 times. So the division gives me 5722.5. So that's the same as before.\n\nWait, but the options given are A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870. Hmm, 5722.5 is close to option B)5723. But wait, that's a fraction. So the options probably expect an integer, so maybe they rounded it. So the correct answer would be 5723, which is option B. But let me check the options again. Oh wait, the options are written as \"s.\" which I think is just the currency symbol, so that's fine.\n\nWait, but another approach: perhaps the discount was 20% off the selling price, meaning the Rs.4578 is after the discount. So the original price would be higher. Let me compute it again. 20% discount means the customer pays 80% of the original price. So original price = 4578 / 0.8.\n\nWait, 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 4578 *5=22890, then divided by 4. 22890 /4 is 5722.5. So yes, same result.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 5723, which is the nearest whole number. So the correct answer should be B. But wait, let me look at the options again. Option C is 5040. That's way lower than our result. Option A is 5050, also lower. Option D is 4950, lower. Option E is 4870, also lower. So only option B is higher than 4578, which makes sense because the original price must be higher than the discounted price.\n\nWait a second, but the question is phrased as \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" Wait, that's confusing. Oh, wait, no. Vinit purchased it for 4578, which is the discounted price. So the actual selling price before discount is higher. But wait, the question says \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" Hmm, maybe I misread the question. Because if it's on sale, the price Vinit paid is the discounted price. So the actual selling price would be the original price, right? So I think my initial approach was correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me think again. The discount is 20%, so the selling price is 80% of the marked price. So if the article was sold for 4578, that's 80% of the marked price. So the original marked price is 4578 / 0.8 = 5722.5. So the actual selling price, before discount, was 5722.5, which rounds to 5723, so option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as the original price, and the selling price is after discount. So yeah, the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be option B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the actual selling price of the article before the discount, we start by noting that Vinit purchased the article for Rs. 4578 during a 20% discount sale.
