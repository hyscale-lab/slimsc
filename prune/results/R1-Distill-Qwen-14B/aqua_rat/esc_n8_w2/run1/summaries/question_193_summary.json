      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says: A two-digit number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. Also, the digit in the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. I need to find what the number is, and the options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. First, it's a two-digit number. So, let's represent it as a number where the ten's digit is, say, 'a' and the unit's digit is 'b'. So the number itself would be 10a + b. Because, for example, if a is 3 and b is 4, the number is 34.\n\nThe problem states two things. First, the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So the sum of the digits is a + b, right? And the number itself is 10a + b. So according to the first condition, 10a + b is equal to (a + b) plus 18. Let me write that as an equation: 10a + b = (a + b) + 18.\n\nWait, but when I simplify that equation, I can subtract (a + b) from both sides. So 10a + b - a - b = 18. That simplifies to 9a = 18. Oh, so 9a equals 18. Dividing both sides by 9 gives a = 2. So the ten's digit is 2. That's one part.\n\nThe second condition says the digit in the unit's place is double the ten's digit. Since the ten's digit is 2, the unit's digit must be 2 * 2 = 4. So the number is 24? Let me check the options. Option B is 24. So that's looking promising.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nSo, number is 10a + b. Sum of digits is a + b. The number is 18 more than the sum. So equation is 10a + b = (a + b) + 18. Subtract (a + b) from both sides: 9a = 18. a = 2. Then, since b is double a, b = 4. So the number is 24. Let me see if that fits the conditions.\n\nSum of digits is 2 + 4 = 6. The number is 24. 24 minus 6 is 18. Yep, that's correct. So 24 fits the first condition. The second condition is also satisfied because 4 is double of 2.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 24. So that's the answer. But wait, let me look at the other options to see if any of them could also fit, just in case.\n\nOption A is 12. Sum of digits is 3. 12 -3 =9, which is less than 18. So no.\n\nOption C is 42. Sum is 4+2=6. 42-6=36, which is more than 18. So no.\n\nOption D is 48. Sum is 12. 48-12=36. Again, more than 18.\n\nOption E is 49. Sum is 13. 49-13=36. Still too high.\n\nSo no other options fit the condition of exceeding by 18. Therefore, 24 is the correct answer.\n",

Also, the digit in the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. I need to find what the number is, and the options are A)12, B)24, C)42, D)48, E)49.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. I think I should start by representing the two-digit number in terms of its digits. So, let's say the digit in the ten's place is 'x', and the digit in the unit's place is 'y'. Then the two-digit number itself can be written as 10x + y. Right, because the first digit is in the tens place, so it's multiplied by 10.\n\nThe problem states two main conditions. The first condition is that the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So, mathematically, that would mean:\n\n10x + y = (x + y) + 18.\n\nBecause the number is 10x+y, and the sum of the digits is x + y. So the equation is that 10x + y is equal to (x + y) plus 18.\n\nThe second condition is that the unit's digit is double the ten's digit. So that gives another equation: y = 2x.\n\nOkay, so now I have two equations:\n\n1. 10x + y = x + y + 18\n2. y = 2x\n\nLet me simplify the first equation. Subtract (x + y) from both sides:\n\n10x + y - x - y = 18\nWhich simplifies to 9x = 18.\n\nSo, 9x = 18 \u2192 x = 2. So the ten's digit is 2.\n\nThen, since y is double x, y = 2*2=4.\n\nSo the two-digit number would be 10x + y = 10*2 +4=24.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. Option B is 24. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's plug the number back into the original conditions.\n\nFirst condition: The number (24) exceeds the sum of its digits by 18.\n\nSum of digits: 2+4=6.\n\n24 - 6 = 18. Yes, that works.\n\nSecond condition: Unit's digit is double ten's digit. 4 is 2*2, which is correct.\n\nSo the number should be 24, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me look at the options again. The options are A)12, B)24, C)42, D)48, E)49.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check another option just to be thorough. What if I made a mistake in the equations?\n\nWait, another approach: Let me represent the number as 10x + y. The sum of digits is x + y. The number is 18 more than this sum, so 10x + y = (x + y) + 18. So, 9x =18 \u2192 x=2. y=4. So the number is 24.\n\nLooking at the options, 24 is option B. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check all the options to see if any other number fits.\n\nOption A: 12. Let's see. Sum of digits:1+2=3. 12-3=9. Not 18. So no.\n\nOption B:24. Sum is 6. 24-6=18. Correct. Unit digit is 4, which is 2*2. Correct.\n\nOption C:42. Sum is 6. 42-6=36. Not 18. So no.\n\nOption D:48. Sum is 12. 48-12=36. No.\n\nOption E:49. Sum is 13. 49-13=36. No.\n\nSo only option B satisfies both conditions. Therefore, the answer should be B)24.\n",
