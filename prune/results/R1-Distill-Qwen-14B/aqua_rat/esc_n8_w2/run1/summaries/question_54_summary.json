      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where there are 10 oranges in a basket, and I need to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges. Hmm, I think this is a combinatorics question. I remember that combinations are used when the order doesn't matter. Like, if I choose orange A and then orange B, it's the same as choosing B and then A. So combinations would be the right approach here.\n\nWait, the formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! divided by (k! times (n-k)!)). Right, so n is 10 and k is 2. Let me plug those numbers in. So 10 choose 2 is 10! divided by (2! * (10-2)! ), which is 10!/(2! * 8! ).\n\nBut wait, calculating 10 factorial might be tedious. Maybe I can simplify this. Oh right, because 10! is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8! So the 8! in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. So it becomes (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8! ) / (2! \u00d7 8! ), which simplifies to (10 \u00d79 ) / 2! So 10*9 is 90, and 2! is 2*1=2. So 90 divided by 2 is 45.\n\nSo the number of ways is 45. Looking at the options, option A is 45. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, could I have made a mistake? Did I use the correct formula? Yeah, because when the order doesn't matter, it's combination. If I had used permutation, it would be 10*9=90, which is option B. But since choosing 2 oranges doesn't care about the order, it's combinations, so 45 is correct. So yes, A is the right choice.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from 10, we use combinations since the order of selection does not matter.
