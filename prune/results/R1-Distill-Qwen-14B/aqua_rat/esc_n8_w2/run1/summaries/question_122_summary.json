      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a cyclist and how long it takes to travel a certain distance. Let's see, the question says the cyclist is going at 12 miles per hour, and we need to find out how many minutes it'll take to go 48 miles. Hmm, right, speed, time, distance... I remember the formula is something like time equals distance divided by speed.\n\nWait, yeah, the formula is Time = Distance / Speed. So I should plug in the numbers here. The distance is 48 miles, and the speed is 12 mph. So 48 divided by 12. Let me calculate that. 48 divided by 12 is 4. Oh, so that's 4 hours. But wait, the question asks for minutes, not hours. Oh right, so I need to convert hours to minutes.\n\nHow do I convert hours to minutes again? Well, 1 hour is 60 minutes, right? So if it's 4 hours, I multiply by 60. Let me do that: 4 times 60 equals 240 minutes. Hmm, but looking at the options, option B is 240. So that must be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I do the division right? 12 times 4 is 48, so yeah, 48 divided by 12 is 4. Then 4 hours to minutes is 240. Yep, that makes sense. So the answer should be option B.\n",

So if I rearrange that, time equals distance divided by speed. That makes sense.\n\nThe cyclist's speed is 12 mph, and the distance is 48 miles. So I can plug those numbers into the formula.

So the time taken is 240 minutes.\n\nNow looking at the options, option B is 240. So the answer should be B. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 48 divided by 12 is indeed 4, and 4 times 60 is 240. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I made any errors here.
