      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two cars starting from opposite ends of a highway. Hmm, let me think about how to approach it.\n\nAlright, the problem says the highway is 50 miles long. Car one is going at 12 mph, and car two at 13 mph. They start at the same time from opposite ends. I need to find out how long it takes for them to meet. \n\nWait, so when they meet, the total distance they've covered together should add up to the length of the highway, right? Because they're moving towards each other. So their speeds add up. Oh right, that's how relative speed works in such problems.\n\nSo, the combined speed of both cars is 12 + 13, which is 25 mph. Wait, yeah, because they're moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. \n\nNow, the distance between them is 50 miles. So the time it takes for them to meet would be the total distance divided by their combined speed. That makes sense because time equals distance over speed.\n\nLet me calculate that. Time = 50 miles / 25 mph. 50 divided by 25 is 2. So the time would be 2 hours. Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 2. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Car A goes 12 mph, car B 13. So in one hour, together they cover 25 miles. So after one hour, they've covered 25 miles. But the highway is 50 miles long. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait no, I think I made a mistake. Because if they are moving towards each other, the distance between them decreases at 25 mph. So the time until they meet is when the sum of the distances they've traveled equals 50 miles.\n\nWait, yeah, that's correct. So 50 divided by 25 is 2 hours. So after two hours, they meet. So the answer is E) 2.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 2. So that's the correct choice. I think that's right.\n",
