      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully. The question says, \"If one third of 3/4 of a number is 21. Then, find the number?\" And there are five options to choose from: A)84, B)66, C)28, D)19, E)11.\n\nHmm, I need to find the original number. Let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty with word problems, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, the problem states that one third of 3/4 of a number equals 21. So, let's represent the unknown number as 'x'. The way the problem is phrased, it's like taking 3/4 of x and then finding one third of that result. So, mathematically, I can write this as:\n\n(1/3) * (3/4) * x = 21\n\nWait, let me make sure I have the order right. It's one third of (3/4 of x). So yes, that's (3/4 x) multiplied by (1/3), which gives (3/4 * 1/3) x.\n\nLet me compute the fractions first. 3/4 multiplied by 1/3. Multiplying the numerators: 3*1=3. Denominators:4*3=12. So, 3/12 simplifies to 1/4. Oh, that's nice. So, (1/4) * x =21.\n\nWait, so (1/4)x is 21. To find x, I can multiply both sides by 4. So, x=21 *4. 21 times 4 is 84. So x is 84. That's option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again.\n\nOriginal problem: one third of 3/4 of x is 21.\n\nSo, 3/4 of x is (3/4)x. Then, one third of that is (1/3)*(3/4)x. Multiplying the fractions: (1*3)/(3*4) = 3/12 = 1/4. So, (1/4)x =21.\n\nSo x=21*4=84. Yep, that's correct. So the number is 84, which is option A.\n\nI can also test this. Let's plug 84 into the problem. 3/4 of 84 is (3/4)*84. Let me calculate that: 84 divided by 4 is 21, multiplied by 3 is 63. Then, one third of 63 is 21. Which matches the problem statement. So yes, 84 is correct.\n\nLooking at the options, A is 84. So the answer should be A.\n",

So, the problem is about finding a number based on some fractions of it. Let me parse it.\n\nThe problem states that one third of 3/4 of the number equals 21. So, let's translate that into an equation. Let's denote the number as 'x'. \n\nSo, 3/4 of x is (3/4)*x. Then, one third of that would be (1/3) multiplied by (3/4)*x. And that equals 21.\n\nPutting that together, the equation is: (1/3) * (3/4) * x = 21.\n\nWait, I can simplify that. Let's see, (1/3) multiplied by (3/4) is... Let me compute that. 1/3 * 3/4 is (1*3)/(3*4) = 3/12. Oh, wait, 3/12 simplifies to 1/4. So the equation becomes (1/4)*x = 21.\n\nSo, if (1/4)*x is 21, then x must be 21 multiplied by 4.
