      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. \n\nThe problem is about Mr. Jain betting on horses in a race. There are five horses in total, and he selects two at random. We need to find the probability that he picked the winning horse. The options are A to E, with fractions like 1/5, 2/5, etc. \n\nHmm, wait. So the key points are: 5 horses, he picks two randomly, and we're looking for the chance that at least one of his two horses is the winner. Because if he has the winning horse, he wins the bet, right? Or does he need both? Wait, the question says he bets on them, but it doesn't specify if he needs both to win or just one. Oh, wait, the wording says \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" So maybe it's the probability that he has the winning horse among his two selected. So whether he has one or both, as long as the winning horse is in his selection, that's a success. \n\nWait, no. Wait, the wording says he selects two and bets on them. The probability that he selected the winning horse. So, perhaps the winning horse is just one, and he needs to have selected that particular horse. So the question is, what's the probability that among the two he chose, the winning horse is present. Because if he picks the winner, he might win the bet. \n\nSo, the problem is about calculating the probability that the winning horse is among the two he selected. \n\nOkay, so how to approach this. Let's think in terms of combinations. \n\nThere are 5 horses, and he selects 2. The total number of possible ways to choose 2 horses out of 5 is the combination of 5 choose 2. The formula for combinations is n choose k = n! / (k! (n -k)! ). So 5 choose 2 is (5*4)/(2*1) = 10 possible ways.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways he can choose the winning horse and one other horse. Because the winning horse is just one specific horse. So how many ways can he pick the winning horse plus one other? Well, the winning horse is one, and the other can be any of the remaining four. So the number of favorable combinations is 4. Because he has to pick the winner and one of the other four. So 1 (for the winner) multiplied by 4 (for the others) gives 4 favorable pairs.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. If the winning horse is, say, horse A, then the pairs that include A are: A and B, A and C, A and D, A and E. So that's four pairs. So yes, 4 favorable outcomes.\n\nSo the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That would be 4 / 10, which simplifies to 2/5. \n\nSo the probability is 2/5. Looking at the options, option B is 2/5. So the answer should be B.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is: the probability that he selects the winning horse is the same as 1 minus the probability that he doesn't select the winning horse. Let's see.\n\nThe probability that he doesn't pick the winning horse is the number of ways to choose 2 horses from the 4 non-winning horses. 4 choose 2 is 6. So the probability of not selecting the winner is 6/10, which is 3/5. Therefore, the probability of selecting the winner is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo both methods give the same result, which confirms that option B is correct.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Total number of possible outcomes**: Mr. Jain selects 2 horses out of 5.

Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says: There are 5 horses in a race. Mr. Jain selects two of them at random and bets on them. We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. The options are A)1/5, B)2/5, C)3/5, D)4/5, E)6/5.\n\nHmm, okay. So, I'm a bit rusty on probability, but let's think. The key here is to find the probability that at least one of the two horses he picks is the winner.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a second. The problem says he selects two horses and bets on them. Does that mean he's betting that both are winners, or that at least one is the winner? Oh, wait, in a race, there's only one winning horse, right? So, when he bets on two horses, he's probably hoping that at least one of them is the winner. Because in horse racing, each horse has a chance to win, but only one wins.\n\nSo, the scenario is: there are 5 horses, only one of which is the winner. Mr. Jain picks two horses randomly. What's the probability that at least one of those two is the winning horse.\n\nAlternatively, the question could be interpreted as the probability that he selected the winning horse among his two choices. Hmm, but that's the same as the previous statement because if he selects the winning horse, then at least one is the winner.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The question says, \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" So, perhaps it's the probability that the winning horse is among his two selected. So, that would be the same as the probability that at least one of the two is the winner.\n\nSo, how do I calculate that?\n\nI think the standard approach for such probability problems is to find the probability of the event happening. Here, the event is that the winning horse is among the two selected. Alternatively, the complement of this event is that neither of the two selected horses is the winner. So, perhaps it's easier to calculate the complement and subtract from 1.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Total number of horses = 5. Only one is the winner.\n\n2. Mr. Jain selects two horses at random. So, the number of possible ways to choose two horses is the combination of 5 taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is nCr = n!/(r! (n-r)!).\n\nSo, 5C2 = (5*4)/(2*1) = 10 possible pairs.\n\n3. The number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways he can select the winning horse plus one other horse. Since he needs to pick the winning horse (1 choice) and then one more horse from the remaining four. So, the number of favorable pairs is 4 (since after choosing the winner, you choose any one of the other four).\n\nWait, but wait. If he picks two horses, one of which is the winner, the number of such pairs is 4, as you have to choose 1 more from the 4 non-winners. So, 4 favorable pairs.\n\nSo, the probability of selecting at least one winner is (number of favorable pairs) / (total number of pairs) = 4/10 = 2/5.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that he didn't select the winner is (number of ways to choose 2 non-winners) / total. The number of non-winning horses is 4. So, the number of ways to choose two non-winners is 4C2 = 6. So, the probability of not selecting the winner is 6/10 = 3/5. Thus, the probability of selecting the winner is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5.\n\nSo, both approaches give the same result. So, the probability is 2/5, which is option B.\n\nWait, but another approach: the probability that the first horse he picks is the winner is 1/5. The probability that the second horse is the winner, given that the first wasn't, is (1/4), since one horse is already chosen and it's not the winner. So, the probability that he picks the winner in either of the two selections is P(first is winner) + P(second is winner and first isn't).\n\nWhich would be (1/5) + (4/5)*(1/4) = 1/5 + (4/5)*(1/4) = 1/5 + 1/5 = 2/5.\n\nSame result. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, think in terms of the probability that he selected the winning horse. Since he's choosing two, the chance is 2/5, because there are 5 horses, and he picks two. So, the probability that the winning horse is among his two is 2/5.\n\nWait, is that a valid approach? Let me think. The winning horse is equally likely to be in any position. So, the probability that the winning horse is in any particular subset of two is 2/5. That makes sense.\n\nSo, all methods point to 2/5 as the probability. So, the correct answer is option B.\n",
