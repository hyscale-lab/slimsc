      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about population growth in a place called Boomtown. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question says that the city's population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection comes true, then the population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago. I need to find the percent population increase over the last year, and choose the closest option from the given choices.\n\nWait, wait. Let me break this down. So, first, let's think about the future. The planners expect a 10% increase each year for the next two years. So that's two consecutive 10% increases. Let's say the current population is P. Then, after the first year, it'll be P plus 10% of P, which is P * 1.1. After the second year, another 10% increase, so that would be 1.1 * (1.1 P) = (1.1)^2 P.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the population two years from now (which is 1.21 P) is exactly double the population of one year ago. One year ago would be the population before the first 10% increase. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, no. If two years from now is the target, and the population then is double what it was one year ago, I need to clarify the timeline. Let's make a timeline:\n\nLet me define the current time as year 0. Then, one year ago would be year -1. So, the population one year ago (year -1) is P_prev. The population two years from now (year +2) is P + 2 years of growth. Wait, but the growth is only projected for the next two years, so maybe the current population is P, and the next two years are +1 and +2.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to assign variables to different points in time.\n\nLet me define:\n- Let the current population be P (at time t=0).\n- The population one year ago (t=-1) would be P_prev.\n- In one year (t=1), the population will be P * 1.1.\n- In two years (t=2), the population will be P * (1.1)^2 = P * 1.21.\n\nThe problem states that the population two years from now (t=2) is double the population one year ago (t=-1). So,\n\nPopulation at t=2 = 2 * Population at t=-1.\n\nSo, 1.21 P = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut P_prev is the population one year before t=0, which is P_prev = P_current / (1 + r), where r is the growth rate from t=-1 to t=0. Wait, but we don't know the growth rate over the last year. That's what we're trying to find. Let me denote the growth rate from t=-1 to t=0 as x (in decimal form, so x = percentage /100).\n\nSo, P_prev * (1 + x) = P.\n\nSo, P_prev = P / (1 + x).\n\nSubstituting back into the earlier equation:\n\n1.21 P = 2 * (P / (1 + x)).\n\nLet me write that again:\n\n1.21 P = 2 * (P / (1 + x)).\n\nI can cancel P from both sides since it's non-zero.\n\n1.21 = 2 / (1 + x).\n\nNow, solve for x.\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 + x):\n\n1.21 (1 + x) = 2.\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + x = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCalculate 2 divided by 1.21. Let me compute that. 1.21 is approximately 121/100, so 2 / (121/100) = 2 * (100/121) = 200/121 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo,\n\n1 + x \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\nx \u2248 0.65289.\n\nThat's approximately 65.289%. So the growth rate over the last year was about 65.29%. Looking at the options, the closest is D)65%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, starting with 1.21 P = 2 * P_prev.\n\nAnd P_prev = P / (1 + x).\n\nSo 1.21 P = 2 * (P / (1 + x)).\n\nDivide both sides by P: 1.21 = 2/(1 + x).\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 + x): 1.21 (1 + x) = 2.\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21: 1 + x = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCompute 2 / 1.21: Let me compute that accurately.\n\n1.21 * 1.65 = 2.00? Let's see: 1.21 * 1.65.\n\nWait, 1.21 * 1.65:\n\n1.21 * 1.6 = 1.936.\n\n1.21 * 0.05 = 0.0605.\n\nAdding: 1.936 + 0.0605 = 1.9965, which is approximately 2. So 1.21 * 1.65 \u2248 2. So 2/1.21 \u2248 1.65289, as I had before.\n\nSo x \u2248 0.65289, which is 65.289%.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 65%, which is the closest.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about population growth in Boomtown. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on. The question says that the planners expect a 10% increase per year over the next two years. Wait, so each year, the population goes up by 10% of its current value. But then there's another part: two years from now, the population would be exactly double what it was one year ago. Wait, wait, I need to parse that correctly.\n\nLet me rephrase. Let's say the current population is P. Then, next year, it'll be P plus 10% of P, which is 1.1P. The year after that, it'll be another 10% increase on top of that, so 1.1 times the previous year's population. So after two years, the population would be 1.1 * 1.1 * P = 1.21P.\n\nBut the problem says that this two-year projection would make the population exactly double what it was one year ago. Wait, one year ago? So that's the population before this year's increase. So one year ago, the population was P divided by 1.1, because last year's population was P, and it increased by 10% to become this year's P. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if this year's population is P, then last year's population was P / 1.1. Because if last year was Q, then this year is Q * 1.1 = P. So Q = P / 1.1.\n\nSo, two years from now, the population is 1.21P. According to the problem, this is double the population one year ago. So 1.21P should equal 2 * (P / 1.1). Let me write that equation down:\n\n1.21P = 2 * (P / 1.1)\n\nHmm, let's compute the right side. 2 divided by 1.1 is approximately 1.818... So 2*(P/1.1) is (2/1.1) P \u2248 1.818P.\n\nWait, but the left side is 1.21P. So setting them equal:\n\n1.21P = (2/1.1) P\n\nWait, but 2/1.1 is about 1.818, and 1.21 is less than that. Wait, that can't be right. Because 1.21 is about 21% increase over two years, and 1.818 is about 81% increase. So how can 1.21P equal 1.818P? That would imply 1.21 = 1.818, which isn't true. Did I make a mistake in my setup?\n\nWait, maybe I got the time references wrong. Let me think again. The problem says, \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" So, one year ago from when? Two years from now would be in the future, so one year ago from that point is one year before the two years from now, which is one year from now. Wait, no, wait. Let's clarify the timeline.\n\nLet me define the present as time zero. The next two years are year 1 and year 2. So two years from now would be time t=2. One year ago from that point would be time t=2 -1 = t=1. So the population at t=2 is double the population at t=1.\n\nSo, according to the problem, after two years, population is 1.21P (where P is current population at t=0). But according to the condition, 1.21P = 2 * (population at t=1). What's the population at t=1? It's 1.1P. So 1.21P = 2*(1.1P) ?\n\nWait, but 2*1.1P is 2.2P. So 1.21P = 2.2P? That can't be right unless P is zero, which isn't the case. So I must have messed up the time references.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"one year ago\" refers to the current time. Let me think again. If I'm at time t=0 (now), then one year ago is t=-1. Two years from now is t=2. So the population at t=2 would be double the population at t=-1. So the equation is:\n\nPopulation at t=2 = 2 * Population at t=-1.\n\nPopulation at t=2 is (1.1)^2 * Population at t=0. Population at t=-1 is Population at t=0 divided by 1.1 (since it was a 10% increase from t=-1 to t=0). So:\n\n(1.1)^2 * P = 2 * (P / 1.1 )\n\nLet me compute (1.1)^2. 1.1 *1.1 = 1.21. So:\n\n1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.1 )\n\nSimplify the right side: 2/1.1 is approximately 1.818. So:\n\n1.21 P = (2 / 1.1) P \u2192 1.21 = 2 / 1.1 ?\n\nWait, 2 divided by 1.1 is 1.818... So 1.21 equals 1.818? No, that can't be. So this suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the problem is that the growth rate is 10% each year, but maybe the current population is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should set up the equations more carefully.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet P0 be the population one year ago (t=-1).\n\nThen, the current population (t=0) is P0 * 1.1.\n\nThe population after two years (t=2) is P0 * (1.1)^3. Because each year, it's multiplied by 1.1. From t=-1 to t=0: P0 \u2192 1.1 P0. Then t=0 \u2192 t=1: 1.1 * 1.1 P0 = (1.1)^2 P0. Then t=1 \u2192 t=2: 1.1 * (1.1)^2 P0 = (1.1)^3 P0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the projection is for the next two years, which is from t=0 to t=2. So from t=0 to t=1: 1.1 times. Then t=1 to t=2: another 1.1 times. So t=2 population is (1.1)^2 * P0_current. Wait, no. P0_current is the current population at t=0, which is 1.1 P_{-1}.\n\nWait, maybe I should reorganize the variables.\n\nLet me let P_current be the population at t=0.\n\nThen, the population at t=1 is P_current * 1.1.\n\nAt t=2, it's (1.1)^2 P_current.\n\nThe problem states that the population at t=2 is double the population one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? If the statement is made at t=0, then one year ago is t=-1. So the population at t=2 is 2 * P_{t=-1}.\n\nBut P_{t=-1} is the population one year before t=0, so it's P_current / 1.1 (because from t=-1 to t=0, it increased by 10%, so P_current = P_{t=-1} * 1.1 \u2192 P_{t=-1} = P_current / 1.1).\n\nSo the equation is:\n\nPopulation at t=2 = 2 * P_{t=-1}.\n\nWhich is:\n\n(1.1)^2 P_current = 2 * (P_current / 1.1 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n1.21 P_current = 2 P_current / 1.1\n\nMultiply both sides by 1.1 to eliminate denominator:\n\n1.21 * 1.1 P_current = 2 P_current.\n\n1.21 * 1.1 is let's compute that: 1.21 * 1 = 1.21, 1.21 * 0.1=0.121 \u2192 total 1.331.\n\nSo 1.331 P_current = 2 P_current.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because 1.331 is less than 2, so this equation would imply 1.331 = 2, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'one year ago' refers to one year ago from two years from now. So when the problem says two years from now, the population would be double the population of one year ago. So, the 'one year ago' is one year before two years from now, which is one year from now. So, the population at t=2 is double the population at t=1.\n\nSo, P(t=2) = 2 * P(t=1).\n\nP(t=2) is (1.1)^2 P_current.\n\nP(t=1) is 1.1 P_current.\n\nSo equation is:\n\n(1.1)^2 P_current = 2 * (1.1 P_current )\n\nSimplify:\n\n1.21 P_current = 2.2 P_current.\n\nAgain, this would lead to 1.21 = 2.2, which isn't possible. So I must be misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the 10% increase is over the next two years, so each year's increase is 10% of the previous year's population. So, after two years, the population is (1.1)^2 P_current.\n\nThe problem says that this is double the population one year ago. Wait, one year ago is the population before the current year's increase.\n\nWait, let me rephrase the problem statement: If the projection comes true, then two years from now, the population will be exactly double what it was one year ago. So, the two years from now is the future point, and one year ago is from the current time. So, the population at t=2 is double the population at t=-1.\n\nWait, that brings us back to the initial equation, which leads to a contradiction. So perhaps the mistake is in how I'm setting up the variables.\n\nWait, maybe I should let the current population be P. Then, the population one year ago was P/1.1. Two years from now, it's P * (1.1)^2. According to the problem, that equals 2 * (P / 1.1). So:\n\n1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.1 )\n\nDivide both sides by P (assuming P \u22600):\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 2/1.1 is approximately 1.818.\n\nWait, 1.21 is not equal to 1.818. So that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the time frames.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the 'one year ago' refers to two years ago, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps the problem is that the population one year ago refers to the time two years from now minus one year.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Let's model the population as follows:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nP0 = population two years ago (t=-2)\n\nP1 = population one year ago (t=-1) = P0 * 1.1\n\nP2 = current population (t=0) = P1 * 1.1 = P0 * (1.1)^2\n\nP3 = population one year from now (t=1) = P2 * 1.1 = P0 * (1.1)^3\n\nP4 = population two years from now (t=2) = P3 * 1.1 = P0 * (1.1)^4\n\nThe problem states that P4 = 2 * P1.\n\nBecause two years from now (t=2) is P4, and one year ago from when? If the statement is made at t=0, then one year ago is t=-1, which is P1.\n\nSo, P4 = 2 * P1 \u2192 P0 * (1.1)^4 = 2 * P0 * 1.1.\n\nDivide both sides by P0 (assuming P0 \u22600):\n\n(1.1)^4 = 2 * 1.1.\n\nCompute (1.1)^4: Let's calculate step by step.\n\n1.1^2 = 1.21.\n\n1.21 *1.1 = 1.331 (that's 1.1^3).\n\n1.331 * 1.1 = 1.4641 (1.1^4).\n\nSo, 1.4641 = 2 * 1.1 \u2192 2.2.\n\nBut 1.4641 \u2248 1.464, which is much less than 2.2. So 1.4641 \u2260 2.2. So the equation doesn't hold.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the 10% increase is over the next two years, so the growth is 10% per year each, but compounded. So the total growth factor after two years is 1.1 * 1.1 = 1.21.\n\nBut the problem says that in two years, the population is double what it was one year ago. So, the population two years from now (t=2) is 2 * population at t=1.\n\nWait, because one year ago from t=2 is t=1.\n\nSo, P(t=2) = 2 * P(t=1).\n\nBut P(t=2) is (1.1)^2 * P(t=0) = 1.21 P0.\n\nP(t=1) is 1.1 P0.\n\nSo 1.21 P0 = 2 * 1.1 P0 \u2192 1.21 = 2.2 \u2192 which is not possible.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the population growth rate isn't 10% per year, but something else. Wait, but the question says the planners expect a 10% increase per year. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the population increase over the last year, which is different from the expected 10% per year. Wait, no, the question is about the expected projection, not the past.\n\nWait, let me read the question again: \"Boomtown urban planners expect the city\u2019s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?\"\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the 'last year' refers to the year before the current projection. So, perhaps the population increase over the last year (the year before the two-year projection) is what we're being asked about.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled up. Let me try to outline the timeline again.\n\nAssuming the current year is t=0.\n\nThe planners project that the population will increase by 10% each year for the next two years (t=1 and t=2).\n\nThe problem states that if this projection comes true, then the population at t=2 will be double the population one year ago. One year ago from t=2 is t=1.\n\nSo, P(t=2) = 2 * P(t=1).\n\nBut according to the projection, P(t=1) = 1.1 * P(t=0), and P(t=2) = 1.1 * P(t=1) = 1.1^2 P(t=0) = 1.21 P(t=0).\n\nSo, according to the condition: 1.21 P(t=0) = 2 * [1.1 P(t=0)].\n\nDivide both sides by P(t=0): 1.21 = 2.2 \u2192 which is not possible. So this suggests that the initial growth rate assumption must be incorrect.\n\nWait, but the question says that the planners expect a 10% increase per year, which must be the case. So perhaps the 'one year ago' refers to a different time point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'one year ago' is one year before the current time, i.e., t=-1. So, the population at t=2 is double the population at t=-1.\n\nSo, P(t=2) = 2 * P(t=-1).\n\nBut P(t=2) is (1.1)^2 * P(t=0) = 1.21 P(t=0).\n\nP(t=-1) is the population one year before t=0, which is P(t=-1) = P(t=0) / 1.1.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n1.21 P(t=0) = 2 * (P(t=0) / 1.1 )\n\nDivide both sides by P(t=0):\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 2/1.1 \u2248 1.818.\n\nBut 1.21 is not equal to 1.818. So this is impossible.\n\nHmm. I must be missing something here. Maybe the population growth rate is 10% per year, but in the problem, the two-year growth leads to a doubling over a different period.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this algebraically. Let me set variables:\n\nLet P be the population one year ago (t=-1).\n\nThen, the population now (t=0) is P * 1.1.\n\nIn two years (t=2), the population is (1.1)^2 * (1.1 P) )? Wait, no, that can't be right.\n\nWait, let me think. The population increases by 10% each year.\n\nSo:\n\nt=-2: P_prev\n\nt=-1: P_prev * 1.1 = P\n\nt=0: P * 1.1\n\nt=1: (P *1.1 ) *1.1 = P * (1.1)^2\n\nt=2: P * (1.1)^3\n\nWait, no. Wait, from t=-2 to t=-1: increase by 10% \u2192 P_prev * 1.1 = P.\n\nt=-1 to t=0: another 10% \u2192 P *1.1.\n\nt=0 to t=1: another 10% \u2192 P *1.1 *1.1 = P*(1.1)^2.\n\nt=1 to t=2: another 10% \u2192 P*(1.1)^3.\n\nSo, the population at t=2 is P*(1.1)^3.\n\nThe problem says that this is double the population one year ago. One year ago from t=2 is t=1, whose population is P*(1.1)^2.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nP*(1.1)^3 = 2 * [ P*(1.1)^2 ]\n\nDivide both sides by P*(1.1)^2:\n\n1.1 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible.\n\nThis is confusing because it's leading to a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem is that the population is expected to increase by 10% per year for the next two years, but the increase is over the last year, not the next.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the population increase over the last year, which would be the year before the current projection. So, perhaps the current population is P, and one year ago, it was P/(1.1). But the projection is that the population will increase by 10% each of the next two years, so in two years, it's 1.21P. But according to the problem, this 1.21P equals 2 times the population one year ago (which is P/(1.1)). So:\n\n1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.1 )\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 2 /1.1 \u2248 1.818.\n\nBut 1.21 \u2248 1.21, which doesn't equal 1.818. So this suggests that the scenario is impossible, but the question must have a solution. Therefore, perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the growth is 10% each year, but the current population is not P, but the population one year ago is P. Let me try that.\n\nLet P be the population one year ago (t=-1).\n\nCurrent population (t=0): P * 1.1.\n\nPopulation after two years (t=2): (1.1)^2 * (1.1 P) )= (1.1)^3 P.\n\nProblem states that (1.1)^3 P = 2 * P.\n\nSo, (1.1)^3 = 2 \u2192 1.331 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the 'one year ago' is two years ago from now. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the past growth, not the future projection. Wait, the question is asking for the percent increase in the last year. So, perhaps the last year's growth was higher than 10%, making the projection fit the condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the last year's growth rate is what we're to find. Let me think again.\n\nLet me re-express the problem.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet P be the population one year ago (t=-1).\n\nThen, the current population (t=0) is P * (1 + x), where x is the growth rate for the last year (the unknown we're trying to find).\n\nThe planners expect a 10% increase each of the next two years. So, next year (t=1): current *1.1 = P*(1+x)*1.1.\n\nYear after next (t=2): P*(1+x)*1.1^2.\n\nThe problem says that this t=2 population is double the population one year ago (t=-1), which is P.\n\nSo, equation:\n\nP*(1+x)*(1.1)^2 = 2P.\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n(1+x) * (1.21) = 2.\n\nSo, (1+x) = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCompute 2 / 1.21:\n\n1.21 * 1.65289 \u2248 2.\n\nWait, 1.21 * 1.65289 = 2.\n\nSo, 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo, 1 + x \u2248 1.65289 \u2192 x \u2248 0.65289, or 65.289%.\n\nSo, the growth rate last year was approximately 65.29%. Looking at the options, the closest is D)65%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this setup.\n\nIn this setup, the last year's growth rate is x, making the current population P*(1+x). Then, with two years of 10% growth, it becomes P*(1+x)*(1.1)^2 = 2P.\n\nSolving for x gives x \u224865.289%, which is option D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about population growth in Boomtown. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on. The question says that the planners expect a 10% increase per year over the next two years. Wait, so each year, the population goes up by 10% of its current value. But then there's another part: two years from now, the population would be exactly double what it was one year ago. Wait, wait, I need to parse that correctly.\n\nLet me rephrase. Let's say the current population is P. Then, next year, it'll be P plus 10% of P, which is 1.1P. The year after that, it'll be another 10% increase on top of that, so 1.1 times the previous year's population. So after two years, the population would be 1.1 * 1.1 * P = 1.21P.\n\nBut the problem says that this two-year projection would make the population exactly double what it was one year ago. Wait, one year ago? So that's the population before this year's increase. So one year ago, the population was P divided by 1.1, because last year's population was P, and it increased by 10% to become this year's P. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if this year's population is P, then last year's population was P / 1.1. Because if last year was Q, then this year is Q * 1.1 = P. So Q = P / 1.1.\n\nSo, two years from now, the population is 1.21P. According to the problem, this is double the population one year ago. So 1.21P should equal 2 * (P / 1.1). Let me write that equation down:\n\n1.21P = 2 * (P / 1.1)\n\nHmm, let's compute the right side. 2 divided by 1.1 is approximately 1.818... So 2*(P/1.1) is (2/1.1) P \u2248 1.818P.\n\nWait, but the left side is 1.21P. So setting them equal:\n\n1.21P = (2/1.1) P\n\nWait, but 2/1.1 is about 1.818, and 1.21 is less than that. Wait, that can't be right. Because 1.21 is about 21% increase over two years, and 1.818 is about 81% increase. So how can 1.21P equal 1.818P? That would imply 1.21 = 1.818, which isn't true. Did I make a mistake in my setup?\n\nWait, maybe I got the time references wrong. Let me think again. The problem says, \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" So, one year ago from when? Two years from now would be in the future, so one year ago from that point is one year before the two years from now, which is one year from now. Wait, no, wait. Let's clarify the timeline.\n\nLet me define the present as time zero. The next two years are year 1 and year 2. So two years from now would be time t=2. One year ago from that point would be time t=2 -1 = t=1. So the population at t=2 is double the population at t=1.\n\nSo, according to the problem, after two years, population is 1.21P (where P is current population at t=0). But according to the condition, 1.21P = 2 * (population at t=1). What's the population at t=1? It's 1.1P. So 1.21P = 2*(1.1P) ?\n\nWait, but 2*1.1P is 2.2P. So 1.21P = 2.2P? That can't be right unless P is zero, which isn't the case. So I must have messed up the time references.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"one year ago\" refers to the current time. Let me think again. If I'm at time t=0 (now), then one year ago is t=-1. Two years from now is t=2. So the population at t=2 would be double the population at t=-1. So the equation is:\n\nPopulation at t=2 = 2 * Population at t=-1.\n\nPopulation at t=2 is (1.1)^2 * Population at t=0. Population at t=-1 is Population at t=0 divided by 1.1 (since it was a 10% increase from t=-1 to t=0). So:\n\n(1.1)^2 * P = 2 * (P / 1.1 )\n\nLet me compute (1.1)^2. 1.1 *1.1 = 1.21. So:\n\n1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.1 )\n\nSimplify the right side: 2/1.1 is approximately 1.818. So:\n\n1.21 P = (2 / 1.1) P \u2192 1.21 = 2 / 1.1 ?\n\nWait, 2 divided by 1.1 is 1.818... So 1.21 equals 1.818? No, that can't be. So this suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the problem is that the growth rate is 10% each year, but maybe the current population is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should set up the equations more carefully.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet P0 be the population one year ago (t=-1).\n\nThen, the current population (t=0) is P0 * 1.1.\n\nThe population after two years (t=2) is P0 * (1.1)^3. Because each year, it's multiplied by 1.1. From t=-1 to t=0: P0 \u2192 1.1 P0. Then t=0 \u2192 t=1: 1.1 * 1.1 P0 = (1.1)^2 P0. Then t=1 \u2192 t=2: 1.1 * (1.1)^2 P0 = (1.1)^3 P0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the projection is for the next two years, which is from t=0 to t=2. So from t=0 to t=1: 1.1 times. Then t=1 to t=2: another 1.1 times. So t=2 population is (1.1)^2 * P0_current. Wait, no. P0_current is the current population at t=0, which is 1.1 P_{-1}.\n\nWait, maybe I should reorganize the variables.\n\nLet me let P_current be the population at t=0.\n\nThen, the population at t=1 is P_current * 1.1.\n\nAt t=2, it's (1.1)^2 P_current.\n\nThe problem states that the population at t=2 is double the population one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? If the statement is made at t=0, then one year ago is t=-1. So the population at t=2 is 2 * P_{t=-1}.\n\nBut P_{t=-1} is the population one year before t=0, so it's P_current / 1.1 (because from t=-1 to t=0, it increased by 10%, so P_current = P_{t=-1} * 1.1 \u2192 P_{t=-1} = P_current / 1.1).\n\nSo the equation is:\n\nPopulation at t=2 = 2 * P_{t=-1}.\n\nWhich is:\n\n(1.1)^2 P_current = 2 * (P_current / 1.1 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n1.21 P_current = 2 P_current / 1.1\n\nMultiply both sides by 1.1 to eliminate denominator:\n\n1.21 * 1.1 P_current = 2 P_current.\n\n1.21 * 1.1 is let's compute that: 1.21 * 1 = 1.21, 1.21 * 0.1=0.121 \u2192 total 1.331.\n\nSo 1.331 P_current = 2 P_current.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because 1.331 is less than 2, so this equation would imply 1.331 = 2, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'one year ago' refers to one year ago from two years from now. So when the problem says two years from now, the population would be double the population of one year ago. So, the 'one year ago' is one year before two years from now, which is one year from now. So, the population at t=2 is double the population at t=1.\n\nSo, P(t=2) = 2 * P(t=1).\n\nP(t=2) is (1.1)^2 P_current.\n\nP(t=1) is 1.1 P_current.\n\nSo equation is:\n\n(1.1)^2 P_current = 2 * (1.1 P_current )\n\nSimplify:\n\n1.21 P_current = 2.2 P_current.\n\nAgain, this would lead to 1.21 = 2.2, which isn't possible. So I must be misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the 10% increase is over the next two years, so each year's increase is 10% of the previous year's population. So, after two years, the population is (1.1)^2 P_current.\n\nThe problem says that this is double the population one year ago. Wait, one year ago is the population before the current year's increase.\n\nWait, let me rephrase the problem statement: If the projection comes true, then two years from now, the population will be exactly double what it was one year ago. So, the two years from now is the future point, and one year ago is from the current time. So, the population at t=2 is double the population at t=-1.\n\nWait, that brings us back to the initial equation, which leads to a contradiction. So perhaps the mistake is in how I'm setting up the variables.\n\nWait, maybe I should let the current population be P. Then, the population one year ago was P/1.1. Two years from now, it's P * (1.1)^2. According to the problem, that equals 2 * (P / 1.1). So:\n\n1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.1 )\n\nDivide both sides by P (assuming P \u22600):\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 2/1.1 is approximately 1.818.\n\nWait, 1.21 is not equal to 1.818. So that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the time frames.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the 'one year ago' refers to two years ago, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps the problem is that the population one year ago refers to the time two years from now minus one year.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Let's model the population as follows:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nP0 = population two years ago (t=-2)\n\nP1 = population one year ago (t=-1) = P0 * 1.1\n\nP2 = current population (t=0) = P1 * 1.1 = P0 * (1.1)^2\n\nP3 = population one year from now (t=1) = P2 * 1.1 = P0 * (1.1)^3\n\nP4 = population two years from now (t=2) = P3 * 1.1 = P0 * (1.1)^4\n\nThe problem states that P4 = 2 * P1.\n\nBecause two years from now (t=2) is P4, and one year ago from when? If the statement is made at t=0, then one year ago is t=-1, which is P1.\n\nSo, P4 = 2 * P1 \u2192 P0 * (1.1)^4 = 2 * P0 * 1.1.\n\nDivide both sides by P0 (assuming P0 \u22600):\n\n(1.1)^4 = 2 * 1.1.\n\nCompute (1.1)^4: Let's calculate step by step.\n\n1.1^2 = 1.21.\n\n1.21 *1.1 = 1.331 (that's 1.1^3).\n\n1.331 * 1.1 = 1.4641 (1.1^4).\n\nSo, 1.4641 = 2 * 1.1 \u2192 2.2.\n\nBut 1.4641 \u2248 1.464, which is much less than 2.2. So 1.4641 \u2260 2.2. So the equation doesn't hold.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the 10% increase is over the next two years, so the growth is 10% per year each, but compounded. So the total growth factor after two years is 1.1 * 1.1 = 1.21.\n\nBut the problem says that in two years, the population is double what it was one year ago. So, the population two years from now (t=2) is 2 * population at t=1.\n\nWait, because one year ago from t=2 is t=1.\n\nSo, P(t=2) = 2 * P(t=1).\n\nBut P(t=2) is (1.1)^2 * P(t=0) = 1.21 P0.\n\nP(t=1) is 1.1 P0.\n\nSo 1.21 P0 = 2 * 1.1 P0 \u2192 1.21 = 2.2 \u2192 which is not possible.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the population growth rate isn't 10% per year, but something else. Wait, but the question says the planners expect a 10% increase per year. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the population increase over the last year, which is different from the expected 10% per year. Wait, no, the question is about the expected projection, not the past.\n\nWait, let me read the question again: \"Boomtown urban planners expect the city\u2019s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?\"\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the 'last year' refers to the year before the current projection. So, perhaps the population increase over the last year (the year before the two-year projection) is what we're being asked about.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled up. Let me try to outline the timeline again.\n\nAssuming the current year is t=0.\n\nThe planners project that the population will increase by 10% each year for the next two years (t=1 and t=2).\n\nThe problem states that if this projection comes true, then the population at t=2 will be double the population one year ago. One year ago from t=2 is t=1.\n\nSo, P(t=2) = 2 * P(t=1).\n\nBut according to the projection, P(t=1) = 1.1 * P(t=0), and P(t=2) = 1.1 * P(t=1) = 1.1^2 P(t=0) = 1.21 P(t=0).\n\nSo, according to the condition: 1.21 P(t=0) = 2 * [1.1 P(t=0)].\n\nDivide both sides by P(t=0): 1.21 = 2.2 \u2192 which is not possible. So this suggests that the initial growth rate assumption must be incorrect.\n\nWait, but the question says that the planners expect a 10% increase per year, which must be the case. So perhaps the 'one year ago' refers to a different time point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'one year ago' is one year before the current time, i.e., t=-1. So, the population at t=2 is double the population at t=-1.\n\nSo, P(t=2) = 2 * P(t=-1).\n\nBut P(t=2) is (1.1)^2 * P(t=0) = 1.21 P(t=0).\n\nP(t=-1) is the population one year before t=0, which is P(t=-1) = P(t=0) / 1.1.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n1.21 P(t=0) = 2 * (P(t=0) / 1.1 )\n\nDivide both sides by P(t=0):\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 2/1.1 \u2248 1.818.\n\nBut 1.21 is not equal to 1.818. So this is impossible.\n\nHmm. I must be missing something here. Maybe the population growth rate is 10% per year, but in the problem, the two-year growth leads to a doubling over a different period.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this algebraically. Let me set variables:\n\nLet P be the population one year ago (t=-1).\n\nThen, the population now (t=0) is P * 1.1.\n\nIn two years (t=2), the population is (1.1)^2 * (1.1 P) )? Wait, no, that can't be right.\n\nWait, let me think. The population increases by 10% each year.\n\nSo:\n\nt=-2: P_prev\n\nt=-1: P_prev * 1.1 = P\n\nt=0: P * 1.1\n\nt=1: (P *1.1 ) *1.1 = P * (1.1)^2\n\nt=2: P * (1.1)^3\n\nWait, no. Wait, from t=-2 to t=-1: increase by 10% \u2192 P_prev * 1.1 = P.\n\nt=-1 to t=0: another 10% \u2192 P *1.1.\n\nt=0 to t=1: another 10% \u2192 P *1.1 *1.1 = P*(1.1)^2.\n\nt=1 to t=2: another 10% \u2192 P*(1.1)^3.\n\nSo, the population at t=2 is P*(1.1)^3.\n\nThe problem says that this is double the population one year ago. One year ago from t=2 is t=1, whose population is P*(1.1)^2.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nP*(1.1)^3 = 2 * [ P*(1.1)^2 ]\n\nDivide both sides by P*(1.1)^2:\n\n1.1 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible.\n\nThis is confusing because it's leading to a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem is that the population is expected to increase by 10% per year for the next two years, but the increase is over the last year, not the next.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the population increase over the last year, which would be the year before the current projection. So, perhaps the current population is P, and one year ago, it was P/(1.1). But the projection is that the population will increase by 10% each of the next two years, so in two years, it's 1.21P. But according to the problem, this 1.21P equals 2 times the population one year ago (which is P/(1.1)). So:\n\n1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.1 )\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 2 /1.1 \u2248 1.818.\n\nBut 1.21 \u2248 1.21, which doesn't equal 1.818. So this suggests that the scenario is impossible, but the question must have a solution. Therefore, perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the growth is 10% each year, but the current population is not P, but the population one year ago is P. Let me try that.\n\nLet P be the population one year ago (t=-1).\n\nCurrent population (t=0): P * 1.1.\n\nPopulation after two years (t=2): (1.1)^2 * (1.1 P) )= (1.1)^3 P.\n\nProblem states that (1.1)^3 P = 2 * P.\n\nSo, (1.1)^3 = 2 \u2192 1.331 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the 'one year ago' is two years ago from now. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the past growth, not the future projection. Wait, the question is asking for the percent increase in the last year. So, perhaps the last year's growth was higher than 10%, making the projection fit the condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the last year's growth rate is what we're to find. Let me think again.\n\nLet me re-express the problem.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet P be the population one year ago (t=-1).\n\nThen, the current population (t=0) is P * (1 + x), where x is the growth rate for the last year (the unknown we're trying to find).\n\nThe planners expect a 10% increase each of the next two years. So, next year (t=1): current *1.1 = P*(1+x)*1.1.\n\nYear after next (t=2): P*(1+x)*1.1^2.\n\nThe problem says that this t=2 population is double the population one year ago (t=-1), which is P.\n\nSo, equation:\n\nP*(1+x)*(1.1)^2 = 2P.\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n(1+x) * (1.21) = 2.\n\nSo, (1+x) = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCompute 2 / 1.21:\n\n1.21 * 1.65289 \u2248 2.\n\nWait, 1.21 * 1.65289 = 2.\n\nSo, 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo, 1 + x \u2248 1.65289 \u2192 x \u2248 0.65289, or 65.289%.\n\nSo, the growth rate last year was approximately 65.29%. Looking at the options, the closest is D)65%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this setup.\n\nIn this setup, the last year's growth rate is x, making the current population P*(1+x). Then, with two years of 10% growth, it becomes P*(1+x)*(1.1)^2 = 2P.\n\nSolving for x gives x \u224865.289%, which is option D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Define Variables**:  \n   Let \\( P \\) be the population one year ago (at \\( t = -1 \\)).  \n   The current population (at \\( t = 0 \\)) is \\( P \\times (1 + x) \\), where \\( x \\) is the unknown growth rate for the last year.  \n   The population two years from now (at \\( t = 2 \\)) will be \\( P \\times (1 + x) \\times (1.1)^2 \\), assuming a 10% annual growth rate for the next two years.\n\n2. **Set Up the Equation**:  \n   The problem states that the population two years from now will be double the population one year ago. Thus:  \n   \\[\n   P \\times (1 + x) \\times (1.1)^2 = 2P\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Equation**:  \n   Divide both sides by \\( P \\):  \n   \\[\n   (1 + x) \\times (1.1)^2 = 2\n   \\]  \n   Compute \\( (1.1)^2 = 1.21 \\):  \n   \\[\n   (1 + x) \\times 1.21 = 2\n   \\]  \n   Divide both sides by 1.21:  \n   \\[\n   1 + x = \\frac{2}{1.21}\n   \\]  \n   Compute \\( \\frac{2}{1.21} \\approx 1.65289 \\):  \n   \\[\n   1 + x \\approx 1.65289\n   \\]  \n   Subtract 1 from both sides:  \n   \\[\n   x \\approx 0.65289\n   \\]  \n   Convert to percentage:  \n   \\[\n   x \\approx 65.29\\%\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compare with Options**:  \n   The closest option to \\( 65.29\\% \\) is **65%**, which corresponds to option D.\n\n**Answer: D**",
