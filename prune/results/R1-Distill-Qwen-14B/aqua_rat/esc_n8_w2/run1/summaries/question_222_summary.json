      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here, and I need to figure out Ajay's current age. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the problem again carefully. The problem says: If 6 years are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained. Also, Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years. Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me parse that correctly.\n\nWait, the second part says, \"Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs.\" Oh, wait, so Denis's age is 5 years. So Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis. So Rahul's age is 5 minus 2? That would make Rahul 3 years old. Wait, but that seems very young. Hmm. Or maybe I misread it. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"If Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs.\" So, Denis is 5, and Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis. So Rahul's age is 5 - 2 = 3 years old. That seems correct. So Rahul is 3.\n\nNow, the first part says that if you subtract 6 years from Ajay's current age and then divide the remainder by 18, you get Rahul's age. So, let's represent that mathematically.\n\nLet me assign variables. Let's say Ajay's current age is A. Then, subtract 6: A - 6. Then, divide by 18: (A -6)/18. That equals Rahul's age, which we've found to be 3. So, (A-6)/18 = 3.\n\nNow, solving for A. Multiply both sides by 18: A -6 = 3 *18 =54. Then, add 6 to both sides: A = 54 +6 =60. So Ajay is 60 years old.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, if Ajay is 60, subtract 6 gives 54. Divided by 18 is 3, which is Rahul's age. And Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, who is 5. So 5-2=3. That all adds up.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 60. So the answer should be B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nLet Ajay's present age be \\( A \\). According to the problem, if 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's age and the remainder is divided by 18, the result is Rahul's age. This can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A - 6}{18} = \\text{Rahul's age}.\n\\]\n\nFrom the second part of the problem, Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, and Denis's age is 5 years. Therefore, Rahul's age is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rahul's age} = 5 - 2 = 3 \\text{ years}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting Rahul's age into the first equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A - 6}{18} = 3.\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( A \\):\n\n\\[\nA - 6 = 3 \\times 18 = 54,\n\\]\n\\[\nA = 54 + 6 = 60.\n\\]\n\nThus, Ajay's present age is 60 years.

Then, it says that Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years. We need to find Ajay's present age.\n\nWait, wait, let me break this down.
