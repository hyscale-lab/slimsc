      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about averages, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is again.\n\nThe problem says that passing students had an average of 83, and failing students had an average of 55. The overall class average was 76. I need to find what percent of the class passed. The options are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%.\n\nHmm, I remember that averages and weighted averages can be tricky, but maybe I can set up some equations here.\n\nLet me think: Let's denote the number of passing students as P and the number of failing students as F. The total number of students would then be P + F.\n\nThe total marks for passing students would be 83 * P, and for failing students, it would be 55 * F. The overall average is the total marks divided by the total number of students. So the equation would be:\n\n(83P + 55F) / (P + F) = 76.\n\nI need to solve for the ratio of P to (P + F), which would give me the percentage of students who passed.\n\nHmm, so rearranging that equation. Multiply both sides by (P + F) to get rid of the denominator:\n\n83P + 55F = 76(P + F).\n\nLet me expand the right side: 76P + 76F.\n\nSo, 83P +55F =76P +76F.\n\nLet me subtract 76P and 55F from both sides to get the terms involving P and F on each side. Wait, wait, maybe I should collect like terms.\n\n83P -76P =76F -55F.\n\nSo, 7P =21F.\n\nSimplify that. 7P =21F \u2192 P =3F.\n\nSo the ratio of P to F is 3:1. That means for every 3 passing students, there's 1 failing student. So the total parts are 3 +1 =4 parts. So the percentage of passing students is 3/4, which is 75%. Wait, but 3/4 is 75%, which is option E. But wait, looking at the options, E is 75% and that's one of the choices. But wait, let me double-check because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait a second, let's go through that again.\n\nWe have 7P =21F \u2192 P=3F.\n\nSo the number of passing students is three times the number of failing students. So total students = P + F =3F +F =4F.\n\nThe percentage passed is (P / (P + F)) *100% = (3F /4F)*100% = (3/4)*100% =75%.\n\nHmm, but wait, looking at the options, E is 75%. So why is this not the answer? Or is it?\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I set up the equation correctly?\n\nThe overall average is 76, so the equation is correct. Let me plug in some numbers to test.\n\nSuppose F=100 students. Then P=300. Wait, that's a big class. Let's see.\n\nTotal marks for passing:300 *83= 24,900.\n\nTotal marks for failing:100 *55=5,500.\n\nTotal marks:24,900 +5,500 =30,400.\n\nTotal students:400.\n\nAverage:30,400 /400=76. That's correct.\n\nSo, the percentage of passing students is 300/400 =75%. So that would be option E. But wait, the options given include E)75% as one of the choices.\n\nWait, but the options listed are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%.\n\nSo according to this, the correct answer should be E)75%. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes these problems might have a different approach. Let me try another way.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me think in terms of weighted averages. The difference between the passing average and the class average, and the failing average and the class average.\n\nThe class average is 76. So passing average is 83, which is 7 points above 76. Failing average is 55, which is 21 points below 76.\n\nWait, maybe using the concept of weighted averages: the ratio of the weights (number of students) is inversely proportional to the distance from the class average. So the ratio of failing to passing students would be 7:21, which simplifies to 1:3. So passing students are 3 times the failing students. So the same conclusion as before: 75% passed. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but the options given have E as 75%, which would make sense. So why is the correct answer not E?\n\nWait, but the options given in the problem don't have E as 75%? Let me check the original question again.\n\nWait, the options are: A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%.\n\nYes, E is 75%, so according to my calculation, E is correct. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes these problems might have a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial equation setup.\n\nWait, the equation is correct. The overall average is (83P +55F)/(P +F)=76. Then 83P +55F=76P +76F.\n\nSubtract 76P and 55F: 7P=21F \u2192 P=3F.\n\nSo, P =3F \u2192 P/(P+F) =3F/(4F)=3/4=75%.\n\nSo yes, the correct answer is E)75%.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 75%, which is an option. So why am I getting confused? Maybe I'm overcomplicating, but the calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as a ratio problem. Let me denote the ratio of passing to failing as x :1. So P =x * F, and F=F.\n\nWait, no, perhaps let me let the ratio of passing to failing be r:1, so P = r and F=1. Then, the overall average would be (83r +55*1)/(r+1)=76.\n\nMultiply both sides by (r+1): 83r +55=76(r+1).\n\nExpanding: 83r +55=76r +76.\n\nSubtract 76r: 7r +55=76.\n\nSubtract 55:7r=21 \u2192 r=3. So the ratio is 3:1. So the passing students are 3 parts, failing 1 part. Total 4 parts. So passing is 3/4=75%. So E is correct.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is E)75%.\n",

Hmm, the question says that passing students had an average of 83, failing students had an average of 55. The overall class average was 76. I need to find what percent of the class passed.\n\nWait, averages can be tricky. So, I remember that the overall average is a weighted average based on the number of students who passed and failed. Let's think about it.\n\nLet me denote the number of passing students as P and the number of failing students as F. So the total number of students is P + F.\n\nThe total marks for passing students would be 83 times P, and for failing students, it's 55 times F. The overall average is (Total marks)/(Total students) = 76.\n\nSo, the equation would be (83P + 55F) / (P + F) = 76.\n\nI can rearrange this equation to find the ratio of P to F. Let me multiply both sides by (P + F) to get rid of the denominator.\n\n83P +55F =76(P + F).\n\nExpanding the right side: 76P +76F.\n\nNow, subtract 76P and 76F from both sides.\n\n83P -76P +55F -76F =0.\n\nWhich simplifies to 7P -21F=0.\n\nWait, 7P =21F. Dividing both sides by 7, I get P=3F. So P is three times F.\n\nThat means the number of passing students is three times the number of failing students. So, the ratio of P to F is 3:1.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the percentage of the class that passed. So the total number of students is P + F. If P is 3F, then total is 3F + F =4F.\n\nSo the percentage passed is (P / (P + F)) *100. Substituting P=3F, it's (3F /4F) *100. The F cancels out, so 3/4 is 75%. Oh wait, but wait, looking at the options, E is 75%. But wait, let me double-check the calculation because the options include 66% which is 2/3, but I'm getting 75%.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me go through it again.\n\nThe equation was 83P +55F =76(P + F).\n\nSo 83P +55F =76P +76F.\n\nBringing like terms together: 83P -76P =76F -55F.\n\n7P =21F.\n\nSo 7P=21F => P=3F.\n\nSo P is three times F. So the ratio of passing to failing is 3:1. So the total is 4 parts. So percentage passed is 3/4 which is 75%, which is option E.\n\nWait, but wait, the options don't include 75%? Let me look again. The options are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%. Oh, E is 75. So that's the answer. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes these problems can have a twist. Did I make a mistake in the setup?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use another approach. Let's assume that the number of failing students is 1 unit, and passing is 3 units. So the total is 4 units. So passing is 3/4 which is 75%. So yeah, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit puzzled because 75% seems high. Let me think: if more students passed, the average would be closer to 83. The class average is 76, which is closer to 83 than to 55. Wait, 76 is 7 away from 83 and 21 away from 55. So perhaps the ratio is 21:7, which is 3:1. So the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to think about it is using the concept of weighted averages. The distance from 76 to 83 is 7, and to 55 is 21. So the ratio is 21:7, which simplifies to 3:1. So the ratio of failing to passing is 3:1? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is (passing average - overall average) divided by (overall average - failing average), but I might be getting the ratio reversed.\n\nWait, let me recall the concept of weighted averages. The ratio of the number of students in each group is inversely proportional to the distances from the overall average. So the ratio of failing to passing is (83 -76)/(76-55) =7/21=1/3. So failing:passing is 1:3. So the number of failing is 1, passing is 3, so total is 4. So passing is 75%. So yes, E is correct.\n\nWait, so why is the option B 66%? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me recalculate the distances.\n\nPassing average is 83, overall is 76. So the difference is +7 (since 83 is 7 more than 76). Failing average is 55, which is 21 less than 76. So the distances are 7 and 21. So the ratio of the number of failing to passing students is 7:21, which is 1:3. So passing is 3 times the failing. So passing is 3/(3+1) =75% of the class. So the answer must be E)75%.\n\nBut wait, another approach: Let me assign variables. Let\u2019s say P is the number of passers, F the number of failers.\n\nThe total marks are 83P +55F. The average is (83P +55F)/(P +F) =76.\n\nMultiply both sides:83P +55F=76P +76F.\n\n83P -76P =76F -55F.\n\n7P =21F.\n\nSo P =3F.\n\nSo the number of passers is 3 times the number of failers.\n\nSo the percentage passed is (3F)/(3F +F) *100 = (3/4)*100=75%.\n\nSo yes, the correct answer is E)75%.\n",

Did I make a mistake in the setup?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use another approach. Let's assume that the number of failing students is 1 unit, and passing is 3 units. So the total is 4 units. So passing is 3/4 which is 75%. So yeah, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit puzzled because 75% seems high. Let me think: if more students passed, the average would be closer to 83. The class average is 76, which is closer to 83 than to 55. Wait, 76 is 7 away from 83 and 21 away from 55. So perhaps the ratio is 21:7, which is 3:1. So the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to think about it is using the concept of weighted averages. The distance from 76 to 83 is 7, and to 55 is 21. So the ratio is 21:7, which simplifies to 3:1. So the ratio of failing to passing is 3:1? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is (passing average - overall average) divided by (overall average - failing average), but I might be getting the ratio reversed.\n\nWait, let me recall the concept of weighted averages. The ratio of the number of students in each group is inversely proportional to the distances from the overall average. So the ratio of failing to passing is (83 -76)/(76-55) =7/21=1/3. So failing:passing is 1:3. So the number of failing is 1, passing is 3, so total is 4. So passing is 75%. So yes, E is correct.\n\nWait, so why is the option B 66%? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me recalculate the distances.\n\nPassing average is 83, overall is 76. So the difference is +7 (since 83 is 7 more than 76). Failing average is 55, which is 21 less than 76. So the distances are 7 and 21. So the ratio of the number of failing to passing students is 7:21, which is 1:3. So passing is 3 times the failing. So passing is 3/(3+1) =75% of the class. So the answer must be E)75%.\n\nBut wait, another approach: Let me assign variables. Let\u2019s say P is the number of passers, F the number of failers.\n\nThe total marks are 83P +55F. The average is (83P +55F)/(P +F) =76.\n\nMultiply both sides:83P +55F=76P +76F.\n\n83P -76P =76F -55F.\n\n7P =21F.\n\nSo P =3F.\n\nSo the number of passers is 3 times the number of failers.\n\nSo the percentage passed is (3F)/(3F +F) *100 = (3/4)*100=75%.\n\nSo yes, the correct answer is E)75%.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the percentage of the class that passed based on the given averages. Let\u2019s denote the number of passing students as \\( P \\) and the number of failing students as \\( F \\). The total number of students is \\( P + F \\).\n\nThe total marks for passing students is \\( 83P \\), and for failing students, it is \\( 55F \\). The overall class average is given as 76, so we can write the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{83P + 55F}{P + F} = 76\n\\]\n\nMultiplying through by \\( P + F \\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n83P + 55F = 76(P + F)\n\\]\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n83P + 55F = 76P + 76F\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms to isolate \\( P \\) and \\( F \\):\n\n\\[\n83P - 76P = 76F - 55F\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n7P = 21F\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 7:\n\n\\[\nP = 3F\n\\]\n\nThis means the number of passing students is three times the number of failing students. The total number of students is \\( P + F = 3F + F = 4F \\). The percentage of the class that passed is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P}{P + F} \\times 100 = \\frac{3F}{4F} \\times 100 = 75\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the percentage of the class that passed is **75%**, which corresponds to option **E**.\n\nAnswer: E",
