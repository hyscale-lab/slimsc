      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a money pouch with Rs. 700, and there are equal numbers of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins. I need to figure out how many of each coin there are. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll try to break down the problem. The total amount is Rs. 700, which is 70000 paise because 1 rupee is 100 paise. Oh wait, no, wait. 700 rupees is 700 * 100 = 70,000 paise. Right, that's correct.\n\nNow, the number of each type of coin is the same. Let me denote the number of each coin as 'n'. So there are 'n' 25 paise coins, 'n' 50 paise coins, and 'n' one rupee coins.\n\nWait, but one rupee is 100 paise. So each one rupee coin contributes 100 paise. So the total contribution from each type of coin is:\n\n25 paise coins: 25 * n\n50 paise coins: 50 * n\nOne rupee coins: 100 * n\n\nAdding all these together should give the total amount in paise, which is 70,000.\n\nSo the equation would be:\n\n25n + 50n + 100n = 70000\n\nLet me add those up. 25 + 50 is 75, plus 100 is 175. So 175n = 70000.\n\nNow, solving for n: n = 70000 / 175.\n\nHmm, what's 70000 divided by 175. Let me calculate that.\n\nWell, 175 times 400 is 70,000 because 175*400 = 70,000. So n would be 400.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So each type of coin is 400 in number. So the total number of each is 400. Let me check the options.\n\nThe options given are A)453, B)651, C)400, D)487, E)286.\n\nLooking at option C, it's 400. So that should be the answer. But wait, let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, 25n +50n is 75n, plus 100n is 175n. 175n =70000. So n=70000/175. Let me compute that again.\n\n175 * 400 = 70000, yes. Because 175*4=700, so 175*400=700*100=70000. So yes, n is 400.\n\nSo the number of each coin is 400. So the correct option is C)400.\n",

The total is Rs. 700, and there are equal numbers of 25 paise, 50 paise, and one rupee coins. \n\nWait, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The money pouch has three types of coins: 25 paise, 50 paise, and 1 rupee. And the number of each type is the same. So if there are x coins of 25 paise, then there are also x coins of 50 paise and x coins of 1 rupee.\n\nRight, so the total amount from each type would be 25*paise*x, 50*paise*x, and 100*paise*x (since 1 rupee is 100 paise). Wait, but the total amount is in rupees, so I should probably convert everything to rupees to make it easier.\n\n25 paise is 0.25 rupees, 50 paise is 0.50 rupees, and 1 rupee is 1.00 rupees. So, the total amount from each coin type would be 0.25x, 0.50x, and 1.00x respectively. \n\nAdding all these together should give the total amount in the pouch, which is 700 rupees. So the equation would be:\n\n0.25x + 0.50x + 1.00x = 700.\n\nLet me compute the left side. 0.25 + 0.50 is 0.75, plus 1.00 makes 1.75. So 1.75x = 700.\n\nTo find x, I can divide both sides by 1.75. Let's see, 700 divided by 1.75. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on division, but let me think. 1.75 times 400 is 700 because 1.75*400 = 700. So x must be 400.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that calculation. 1.75 times 400: 1.75 * 400. Let's break it down. 1.75 is the same as 7/4. So 7/4 * 400 = (7 * 400)/4 = (7 * 100) )= 700. Yep, that's correct. So x is 400.\n\nSo each type of coin (25 p, 50 p, 1 rupee) has 400 coins. So the number for each is 400. Looking at the options, option C is 400. But wait, the options are a bit confusing. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are: A)453, B)651, C)400, D)487, E)286.\n\nSo option C is 400. That's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Did I convert everything correctly to rupees? Yes, because 25 p is 0.25, 50 p is 0.50, and 1 rupee is 1.00. So the sum is correct. And the equation setup seems right because the number of each coin is equal. So the calculation is correct.\n",
