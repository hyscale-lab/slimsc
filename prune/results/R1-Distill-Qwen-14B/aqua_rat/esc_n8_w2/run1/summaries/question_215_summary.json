      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about mixing soft drinks. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about changing the concentration of orange juice in a soft drink. \n\nAlright, the problem states that one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water. I need to find out how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink. The options are given, so I'll have to calculate it.\n\nLet me break it down. Initially, I have one gallon. 40% of that is orange juice. So, the amount of orange juice is 0.4 * 1 = 0.4 gallons. And the rest is water, which is 0.6 gallons.\n\nNow, when I add more orange juice, the total volume of the soft drink will increase. Let me say I add x gallons of orange juice. So, the new total volume becomes (1 + x) gallons. \n\nThe amount of orange juice after adding x gallons is 0.4 + x gallons. Because I'm only adding orange juice, the water remains the same at 0.6 gallons.\n\nWe want the orange juice to be 60% of the new mixture. So, setting up the equation:\n\n(0.4 + x) = 0.6 * (1 + x)\n\nLet me solve this equation. Expanding the right side:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nHmm, subtract 0.6x from both sides:\n\n0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\nSubtract 0.4 from both sides:\n\n0.4x = 0.2\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4:\n\nx = 0.2 / 0.4 = 0.5\n\nWait, so x is 0.5 gallons. That means I need to add half a gallon of orange juice. Let me check the options. Option A is 0.5, which matches.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Does this make sense? The initial volume is 1 gallon. Adding 0.5 gallons of OJ gives a total of 1.5 gallons. The OJ is 0.4 + 0.5 = 0.9 gallons. 0.9 divided by 1.5 is indeed 0.6, or 60%. So that checks out.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be A) 0.5.\n",

The task is to find out how many additional gallons of orange juice need to be mixed in so that the orange juice becomes 60% of the soft drink. Hmm, okay.\n\nWait, so initially, we have one gallon. 40% is orange juice, which means 0.4 gallons of OJ, and 0.6 gallons of water. Now, we're adding more orange juice. Let's say we add x gallons of OJ. After adding, the total volume of the soft drink will change because we're only adding OJ, not any water. So the new total volume will be 1 + x gallons. And the amount of OJ will be 0.4 + x gallons, since we're adding x gallons to the existing 0.4.\n\nThe goal is for OJ to make up 60% of the new mixture. So the equation should be: (0.4 + x) = 0.6 * (1 + x). Let me write that down to make it clearer.\n\nSo, 0.4 + x = 0.6 (1 + x). Let's solve for x. Expanding the right side: 0.6 * 1 is 0.6, and 0.6*x is 0.6x. So the equation becomes 0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x.\n\nHmm, I need to get all the x terms on one side and constants on the other. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4 + x -0.6x = 0.6. Which simplifies to 0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6.\n\nNow subtract 0.4 from both sides: 0.4x = 0.2. So x is 0.2 divided by 0.4, which is 0.5. So x is 0.5 gallons. Wait, that's option A. But wait, let me make sure I did that correctly.\n\nLet me double-check the equation. Initial OJ is 0.4 gallons. After adding x, it's 0.4 + x. The total volume is 1 + x. So, (0.4 + x)/(1 + x) = 0.6. That's the same as 0.4 +x = 0.6*(1 +x). Yeah, that's right.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: Let's say after adding x gallons, the total is 1 + x. The OJ is 0.4 + x. 60% of 1 +x is 0.6*(1+x). So, yeah, the equation is correct.\n\nSo solving: 0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x. Subtract 0.6x: 0.4 +0.4x =0.6. Subtract 0.4: 0.4x=0.2. x=0.5. So the answer is 0.5 gallons. Looking at the options, that's option A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. If I add 0.5 gallons of OJ to the initial 1 gallon, the total becomes 1.5 gallons. The OJ is 0.4 +0.5 = 0.9 gallons. 0.9 /1.5 is 0.6, which is 60%. So yes, that works. So the correct answer is 0.5 gallons, which is option A.\n",
