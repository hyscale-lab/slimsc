      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about an astronaut's weight on Earth and Venus. Hmm, I remember that different planets have different gravitational pulls, right? So the astronaut's weight changes based on that. The question is asking what percentage the Venus weight is of the Earth weight. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, the astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth and 182 pounds on Venus. So I guess I need to find what percentage 182 is of 211. Oh right, percentage calculations. I think the formula is (part / whole) * 100%. In this case, the part is Venus weight, and the whole is Earth weight.\n\nSo the calculation would be (182 / 211) * 100. Let me do that step by step. 182 divided by 211. Hmm, what's that approximately? Let me compute.\n\n211 goes into 182... wait, no, 182 is less than 211. So 182 \u00f7 211. Let's see, maybe around 0.86. Because 211 * 0.8 is 168.8, and 211 * 0.86 is 181.46. Oh, that's close to 182. So 0.86 times 100 is 86%. So the percentage is approximately 86%.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 86%. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I get the formula right? Because sometimes people confuse part and whole. But in this case, the question is Venus weight as a percent of Earth weight, so yeah, part is Venus weight. So 182 is the part, 211 is the whole. So the calculation is correct.\n\nI think that's right. So the answer is D.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about an astronaut's weight on Venus compared to Earth. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. \n\nAlright, the astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth and 182 pounds on Venus. The question is asking what percentage 182 is of 211. So, I need to calculate that percentage. \n\nWait, how do you find the percentage one number is of another? Oh right, you take the part divided by the whole, then multiply by 100. So in this case, Venus weight is the part, Earth weight is the whole. So the formula would be (182 / 211) * 100.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's see, 182 divided by 211. Hmm. I can approximate this. 211 is a bit more than 200, so 182 is 91% of 200, but since 211 is a bit larger, the percentage will be a little less than 91%. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh, wait no, 182/200 is 0.91, which is 91%. But since 211 is larger than 200, the denominator is bigger, so the fraction is smaller. So the percentage will be a bit less than 91%.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. Because the question is asking the Venus weight as a percentage of Earth weight. So, 182 is what percent of 211. So it's (182/211)*100. Let me calculate that more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can estimate it. 211 times 0.8 would be 168.8. 211 * 0.85 is 179.35. Oh, wait, 0.85 is 85% of 211. But 182 is higher than 179.35. So maybe 86%? Because 211 * 0.86 is 181.46, which is close to 182. So the percentage is approximately 86%.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 86%, which must be the correct answer. So I think the answer is D.\n",
