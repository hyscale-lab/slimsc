      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So Amy has 10 different types of books, and she wants to code each with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. The goal is to find the smallest number of letters she needs to create all the necessary codes uniquely. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nWait, so each book can have a code that's either one letter or two letters. And each code must be unique for each book. So, she can't have two books with the same single letter or the same pair. But the order in the pair doesn't matter, so AB is the same as BA, right? So each pair is considered once.\n\nThe question is about the minimal number of letters required to represent all 10 books. So, I guess she needs as few letters as possible, but enough so that the total number of possible codes (single letters and pairs) is at least 10.\n\nLet me think about how many codes we can create with a certain number of letters. Let's say she uses 'n' letters. Then, the number of single-letter codes she can make is n. The number of two-letter codes is the number of combinations of two different letters, which is n choose 2, or n*(n-1)/2.\n\nSo the total number of codes is n + n*(n-1)/2. This has to be at least 10.\n\nWe need to find the smallest n where this sum is >=10.\n\nLet me compute this for different n:\n\nn=3: 3 + 3*2/2 = 3 +3=6. That's only 6 codes, which is less than 10. So not enough.\n\nn=4: 4 +4*3/2 =4+6=10. Oh, that's exactly 10. So that's the minimum, right? Because 3 letters only give 6 codes, which isn't enough. So with 4 letters, we get exactly 10 codes, which is exactly what Amy needs.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because the number of two-letter pairs is 6 when n=4. So 4 single letters plus 6 pairs equals 10. So Amy can assign each of her 10 books a unique code. So she needs 4 letters.\n\nSo the answer should be B)4.\n",
