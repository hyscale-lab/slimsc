      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a company that produces computer components. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe company makes 420 units every month. Each unit costs them $110 to produce. They sell all of them by the end of each month. The question is about finding the minimum selling price per component that would ensure a yearly profit of at least $626,400. The options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nHmm. So I need to find the minimum price. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the total production cost for the year. Since they make 420 units each month, I can multiply that by 12 months to get the annual production. So 420 * 12. Let me calculate that: 420 * 12. 420*10 is 4200, 420*2 is 840, so total is 5040 units per year.\n\nEach unit costs $110, so total cost is 5040 * 110. Let's compute that. 5040 * 100 is 504,000, and 5040 *10 is 50,400. So 504,000 +50,400 = 554,400. So the total cost is $554,400 per year.\n\nThey want a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is revenue minus cost. So revenue needs to be cost plus profit. So revenue should be 554,400 + 626,400 = 1,180,800.\n\nWait, no. Wait, profit is revenue minus cost. So revenue must be cost plus desired profit. So yes, 554,400 + 626,400 = 1,180,800.\n\nNow, the revenue is the number of units sold multiplied by the selling price. They sell all 5040 units each year, so revenue is 5040 * price per unit.\n\nSo 5040 * price = 1,180,800. We can solve for price.\n\nPrice = 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me compute that. Hmm, 5040 is 5040. Let's divide 1,180,800 by 5040.\n\nWait, 5040 times 200 is 1,008,000. Because 5040*200 = 5040*2*100=10,080*100=1,008,000.\n\nSo 1,180,800 minus 1,008,000 is 172,800 left. So 5040 * x = 172,800.\n\nWhat's x? Let's see: 5040 * 34 is 5040*30=151,200, plus 5040*4=20,160. 151,200 +20,160=171,360. Hmm, 171,360 is less than 172,800. The difference is 172,800 -171,360=1,440.\n\nSo 5040 * 0.2857 is about 1,440 (because 5040 * 0.2857 \u2248 5040*(2/7) \u2248 1440). So 34 + 0.2857 \u2248 34.2857. So total price is 200 +34.2857\u2248234.2857.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. 5040 * 234.2857 = ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, 5040 * 234 = let's compute that. 5040*200=1,008,000. 5040*34= 171,360. So 1,008,000 +171,360= 1,179,360. But we need 1,180,800, so that's 1,180,800 -1,179,360 = 1,440 left.\n\nSo 1,440 /5040 = 0.2857. So the price is 234.2857, approximately 234.29. But the options are in whole numbers. The options are 226, 230, 240, etc. So the minimum price would have to be the next higher integer. So 235? But wait, none of the options is 235. The options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nSo 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040.\n\nLet me compute this division. Let's see.\n\nFirst, 5040 is 5040. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 \u00f7 504.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's easier.\n\nLet me see how many times 504 fits into 118080.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor both numerator and denominator.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040.\n\n5040 is 5040. Let me see:\n\n5040 * 234 = 5040*(200+34) = 1,008,000 + 5040*34.\n\n5040 *30 =151,200, 5040*4=20,160. So 151,200+20,160=171,360.\n\nSo 5040 *234 =1,008,000 +171,360=1,179,360.\n\nThe target is 1,180,800, which is 1,180,800 -1,179,360=1,440 higher.\n\nSo 1,440 \u00f75040 = 0.2857.\n\nSo 234 + 0.2857 = 234.2857.\n\nSo the price per unit must be approximately $234.29.\n\nBut looking at the options, the next higher option after 230 is 240. So the minimum price is 240. So the answer would be option C)240.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check because sometimes you can have rounding errors or miscalculations.\n\nWait, let me compute 5040 * 230.\n\n5040 *200=1,008,000. 5040*30=151,200. So 1,008,000 +151,200=1,159,200.\n\nThat's the revenue at 230. But the required revenue is 1,180,800. So 1,180,800 -1,159,200=21,600.\n\nSo at 230, revenue is 21,600 less than needed. So 230 is not enough.\n\nSo the next option is 240. Let's compute 5040 *240.\n\n5040*200=1,008,000, 5040*40=201,600. So total 1,209,600.\n\nBut the required revenue is 1,180,800. So 1,209,600 is higher than needed. So 240 would give a profit higher than required. So 240 is the minimum price needed.\n\nWait, but wait. What about 234.29? That's what I calculated earlier. So perhaps the correct answer is 234.29, but the options don't have that. So the next higher option is 240.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's compute the required price.\n\nTotal required revenue is $1,180,800.\n\nNumber of units per year is 420 *12 = 5040.\n\nSo price per unit = 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 / 504.\n\nHmm, 504 * 234 = let's see:\n\n504 * 200 = 100,800.\n\n504 *34 = 504*(30+4) = 504*30=15,120; 504*4=2,016. So 15,120 +2,016=17,136.\n\nSo 504 *234= 100,800 +17,136=117,936.\n\nBut 118,080 is 118,080 -117,936=144 more than that.\n\nSo 144 /504 = 0.2857.\n\nSo 234 + 0.2857=234.2857. So price per unit is approx $234.29.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So the minimum selling price that's higher than this is 240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but why is 240 the next option? Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo 230 is an option, but 234.29 is higher than 230. So 230 is not sufficient, but 240 is.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)240.\n",

Let's compute that. 5040 * 100 is 504,000, and 5040 *10 is 50,400. So 504,000 +50,400 = 554,400. So the total cost is $554,400 per year.\n\nThey want a yearly profit of at least $626,400.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.\n\nThe company produces 420 units of a computer component each month. Each component costs them $110 to produce. They sell all of them by the end of each month. The question is asking for the minimum selling price per component that would ensure a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is calculated as revenue minus production costs.\n\nAlright, so first, I think I need to calculate the total production cost per year and then figure out the required revenue to get the desired profit.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to calculate monthly and then multiply by 12. Let's see.\n\nSo the company makes 420 units a month, each costing $110. So the monthly production cost is 420 * 110. Let me compute that: 420 * 100 is 42,000, and 420 * 10 is 4,200. So total is 46,200 dollars per month.\n\nWait, that's the cost. So each month they spend $46,200 to make the components.\n\nThey sell all 420 units each month. Let the selling price be 'p' dollars per component. So the revenue per month is 420 * p.\n\nThe profit per month would be revenue minus cost, so (420p) - 46,200.\n\nBut the question is about the yearly profit. So the annual profit is 12 times the monthly profit. So 12 * [(420p) - 46200] >= 626,400.\n\nWait, no. Wait, profit per month is revenue minus cost. So for the year, it's 12*(revenue per month - cost per month) = 12*(420p - 46200). This should be >= 626400.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total production cost for the year and the total revenue for the year.\n\nTotal production cost per year: 420 units/month * 12 months * $110. Let's compute that.\n\n420 * 12 = 5040 units per year. Wait no, wait, no. Wait, 420 units are produced each month, so per year it's 420 * 12 = 5040 units. Each unit costs $110, so total production cost is 5040 * 110.\n\nLet me compute that: 5040 * 100 is 504,000. 5040 * 10 is 50,400. So total production cost is 554,400 dollars per year.\n\nThe revenue per year is the number of units sold per year times the price per unit. So revenue = 5040 * p.\n\nProfit is revenue minus production cost. So profit = 5040p - 554400.\n\nWe need this profit to be at least $626,400.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n5040p - 554400 >= 626400.\n\nLet me solve for p.\n\nFirst, add 554400 to both sides:\n\n5040p >= 626400 + 554400.\n\nLet me compute 626400 + 554400. Let's see:\n\n626,400\n+554,400\n= 1,180,800.\n\nSo 5040p >= 1,180,800.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5040 to get p.\n\np >= 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me compute that division.\n\nFirst, let's see if 5040 goes into 1,180,800.\n\nHmm, 5040 * 200 = 1,008,000. Because 5040 * 200 is 5040 * 2 * 100 = 10,080 * 100 = 1,008,000.\n\nSubtract that from 1,180,800: 1,180,800 - 1,008,000 = 172,800.\n\nNow, how many times does 5040 go into 172,800?\n\nLet me compute 5040 * 34 = ?\n\n5040 * 30 = 151,200.\n\n5040 *4 = 20,160.\n\nSo 34 times is 151,200 + 20,160 = 171,360.\n\nWait, but 171,360 is less than 172,800. Let me subtract: 172,800 - 171,360 = 1,440.\n\nNow, 5040 goes into 1,440 how many times? 1,440 / 5040 = 0.2857 (approx). Wait, but maybe another way.\n\nWait, 5040 * 0.2857 is about 1440. So 34.2857 times. So 200 + 34.2857 = 234.2857.\n\nSo p >= approximately 234.2857.\n\nBut since the price has to be a whole number, and they can't sell at a fraction of a dollar, I guess. Or wait, maybe the options are in whole numbers, so the minimum p is 235? But let me check the options.\n\nLooking at the options: A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nHmm, 234.2857 is approximately 234.29. So the minimum price would have to be $235, but that's not one of the options. Wait, did I make a mistake in my calculations?\n\nWait, let me recheck the steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the total production cost. Let me recompute that.\n\nEach month, they make 420 units. Each costs $110, so monthly cost is 420 * 110 = 46,200. That's correct.\n\nYearly, that's 46,200 * 12 = 554,400. Correct.\n\nTotal revenue per year is 5040 * p.\n\nSo profit is 5040p - 554,400 >= 626,400.\n\nSo 5040p >= 626,400 + 554,400 = 1,180,800.\n\nSo p >= 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nAnother approach: Let's divide numerator and denominator by 1000 to simplify.\n\nWait, 5040 = 5.04 * 1000.\n\n1,180,800 = 1.1808 * 10^6.\n\nSo 1.1808e6 / 5.04e3 = (1.1808 / 5.04) * 10^3.\n\nWait, 1.1808 /5.04. Let me compute that.\n\n5.04 goes into 1.1808 how many times?\n\nWait, 5.04 * 0.234 = ?\n\n5.04 * 0.2 = 1.008.\n\n5.04 * 0.034 = 0.17136.\n\nSo 1.008 + 0.17136 = 1.17936.\n\nThat's very close to 1.1808.\n\nSo 0.234 *5.04 is approximately 1.17936, which is just under 1.1808.\n\nThe difference is 1.1808 - 1.17936 = 0.00144.\n\nSo 0.00144 /5.04 = 0.0002857.\n\nSo approximately 0.234 + 0.0002857 = 0.2342857.\n\nSo 0.2342857 * 10^3 is 234.2857.\n\nSo p >= 234.2857. So the minimum price is $235, but the options don't have 235. The closest higher option is 240 (option C). But wait, let me see if I did the calculation correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should double-check the initial approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's compute the required selling price per month to get the desired profit.\n\nWait, another way: The company needs a total profit of $626,400 per year. So the total profit per year is 626,400.\n\nThe profit per unit is (selling price) - (production cost per unit). Because each unit is sold at p, and cost is 110. So profit per unit is p-110.\n\nTotal profit per year is 420 units/month * 12 months * (p - 110) = 5040*(p-110).\n\nWait, 5040*(p-110) >= 626,400.\n\nSo 5040*(p -110) >= 626,400.\n\nDivide both sides by 5040:\n\np - 110 >= 626,400 / 5040.\n\nCompute 626400 /5040.\n\nHmm, let me calculate 5040 * 124 = 5040*(120 +4) = 5040*120=604,800, plus 5040*4=20,160. So 604,800 +20,160=624,960. That's less than 626,400.\n\nWhat about 125? 5040 * 125= 630,000. Because 5040*100=504,000; 5040*25=126,000. 504,000 +126,000=630,000. Which is more than 626,400.\n\nSo 626,400 /5040 is between 124 and 125.\n\nCompute 5040 * 124 = 624,960.\n\n626,400 -624,960=1,440.\n\nSo 1,440 /5040 = 0.2857.\n\nSo 124.2857.\n\nSo p -110 >= 124.2857.\n\nSo p >= 110 + 124.2857 = 234.2857.\n\nAgain, same result as before.\n\nSo p must be at least approximately $234.29. Since the selling price must be a whole number (I think the options are in whole dollars), the next higher whole number is $235. But looking at the options, the closest higher option is 240 (option C). Wait, but let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, 234.29 is between 230 and 240. So the next possible price is 235, but it's not an option. The next higher option is 240, which is C.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the minimum price to guarantee the profit. So if 234.29 is the minimum, but the options don't have 235, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute 5040 * 234.2857 to see if it's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the calculation must be exact. Let me compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nLet me perform the division step by step.\n\n5040 into 1,180,800.\n\nFirst, see how many times 5040 fits into 1,180,800.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 1000: 1180800 /5040 = 1180.8 /5.04.\n\nWait, 5.04 times 234 is 5.04 *200=1008, 5.04*34=171.36. So 1008 +171.36=1179.36. Hmm, 1179.36 is less than 1180.8.\n\nThe difference is 1180.8 -1179.36=1.44.\n\nSo 5.04 * x = 1.44, where x is 1.44/5.04=0.2857.\n\nSo 234 +0.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo p is 234.2857. So the price needs to be at least 234.29. Since the options don't have this, perhaps the correct option is 240, but let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial equation.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's compute the required price per unit based on the per-month calculation.\n\nThe company needs a yearly profit of 626,400.\n\nSo monthly profit needed is 626400 /12 = 52,200.\n\nEach month, the company sells 420 units. Their cost each month is 420*110=46,200.\n\nSo monthly profit is (420p -46200) =52,200.\n\nSo 420p -46200 =52200.\n\nSo 420p =52200 +46200=98400.\n\nSo p =98400/420.\n\nLet me compute that: 98400 \u00f7420.\n\n420 = 42 *10.\n\n98400 \u00f7420 = (98400 \u00f742) \u00f710.\n\nCompute 98400 \u00f742.\n\n42 *2340 = 42*(2000)=84,000, 42*340=14,280. So 84,000 +14,280=98,280. Hmm, but 42*2340=98,280, which is less than 98,400.\n\nWait, 98,400 -98,280=120.\n\nSo 42*2340=98,280.\n\nPlus 42* (120/42)= 42*2.857\u2248120.\n\nWait, 120 \u00f742 is 2 and 36/42, which is 2.857.\n\nSo 2340 + 2.857\u22482342.857.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because 420p =98400 \u2192 p=98400/420.\n\nWait, 98400 \u00f7420 = let's compute it as 98400 \u00f7420.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 60: 98400/60=1640; 420/60=7.\n\nSo 1640 \u00f77 \u2248234.2857.\n\nWhich is the same result as before.\n\nSo p must be at least 234.2857, which is approximately $234.29.\n\nBut the options given are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo 234.29 is between 230 and 240. So the minimum price from the options that is higher than 234.29 is 240. So option C.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check: if the price is 230, what's the profit?\n\nAt 230 per unit:\n\nRevenue per month: 420 *230 = 96,600.\n\nCost per month:46,200.\n\nProfit per month:96,600-46,200=50,400.\n\nYearly: 50,400 *12=604,800.\n\nBut 604,800 is less than 626,400. So not enough.\n\nIf price is 240:\n\nRevenue per month:420 *240=100,800.\n\nProfit per month:100800-46200=54,600.\n\nYearly:54,600 *12=655,200.\n\nWhich is more than 626,400. So 240 is sufficient.\n\nWhat about 234.29? Let's compute the profit.\n\nIf p=234.29, then revenue per month is 420 *234.29.\n\n420 *234 = 98,280; 420 *0.29=121.8. So total is 98,280 +121.8=98,401.8.\n\nProfit per month:98,401.8 -46,200=52,201.8.\n\nWhich is just over 52,200, so yearly would be exactly 52,201.8 *12=626,421.6, which is more than 626,400.\n\nSo the correct price is $234.29. But since the options don't have this, the next higher option is 240.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be done on a per-unit basis, considering that the profit per unit is (p -110), and the total number sold per year is 5040.\n\nSo, 5040*(p -110) >=626,400.\n\nSo, p -110 >=626400 /5040.\n\nCompute 626400 \u00f75040.\n\nHmm, 5040 * 124 = 624,960.\n\n5040 *124 = 624,960.\n\n626,400 -624,960 =1,440.\n\n1,440 \u00f75040 = 0.2857.\n\nSo, p -110 >=124.2857 \u2192 p >= 234.2857.\n\nSo, again, the same result.\n\nBut the options don't have 234.29, so the minimum price from the options is 240 (option C).\n\nSo the correct answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.\n\nThe company produces 420 units of a computer component each month. Each component costs them $110 to produce. They sell all of them by the end of each month. The question is asking for the minimum selling price per component that would ensure a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is calculated as revenue minus production costs.\n\nAlright, so first, I think I need to calculate the total production cost per year and then figure out the required revenue to get the desired profit.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to calculate monthly and then multiply by 12. Let's see.\n\nSo the company makes 420 units a month, each costing $110. So the monthly production cost is 420 * 110. Let me compute that: 420 * 100 is 42,000, and 420 * 10 is 4,200. So total is 46,200 dollars per month.\n\nWait, that's the cost. So each month they spend $46,200 to make the components.\n\nThey sell all 420 units each month. Let the selling price be 'p' dollars per component. So the revenue per month is 420 * p.\n\nThe profit per month would be revenue minus cost, so (420p) - 46,200.\n\nBut the question is about the yearly profit. So the annual profit is 12 times the monthly profit. So 12 * [(420p) - 46200] >= 626,400.\n\nWait, no. Wait, profit per month is revenue minus cost. So for the year, it's 12*(revenue per month - cost per month) = 12*(420p - 46200). This should be >= 626400.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total production cost for the year and the total revenue for the year.\n\nTotal production cost per year: 420 units/month * 12 months * $110. Let's compute that.\n\n420 * 12 = 5040 units per year. Wait no, wait, no. Wait, 420 units are produced each month, so per year it's 420 * 12 = 5040 units. Each unit costs $110, so total production cost is 5040 * 110.\n\nLet me compute that: 5040 * 100 is 504,000. 5040 * 10 is 50,400. So total production cost is 554,400 dollars per year.\n\nThe revenue per year is the number of units sold per year times the price per unit. So revenue = 5040 * p.\n\nProfit is revenue minus production cost. So profit = 5040p - 554400.\n\nWe need this profit to be at least $626,400.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n5040p - 554400 >= 626400.\n\nLet me solve for p.\n\nFirst, add 554400 to both sides:\n\n5040p >= 626400 + 554400.\n\nLet me compute 626400 + 554400. Let's see:\n\n626,400\n+554,400\n= 1,180,800.\n\nSo 5040p >= 1,180,800.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5040 to get p.\n\np >= 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me compute that division.\n\nFirst, let's see if 5040 goes into 1,180,800.\n\nHmm, 5040 * 200 = 1,008,000. Because 5040 * 200 is 5040 * 2 * 100 = 10,080 * 100 = 1,008,000.\n\nSubtract that from 1,180,800: 1,180,800 - 1,008,000 = 172,800.\n\nNow, how many times does 5040 go into 172,800?\n\nLet me compute 5040 * 34 = ?\n\n5040 * 30 = 151,200.\n\n5040 *4 = 20,160.\n\nSo 34 times is 151,200 + 20,160 = 171,360.\n\nWait, but 171,360 is less than 172,800. Let me subtract: 172,800 - 171,360 = 1,440.\n\nNow, 5040 goes into 1,440 how many times? 1,440 / 5040 = 0.2857 (approx). Wait, but maybe another way.\n\nWait, 5040 * 0.2857 is about 1440. So 34.2857 times. So 200 + 34.2857 = 234.2857.\n\nSo p >= approximately 234.2857.\n\nBut since the price has to be a whole number, and they can't sell at a fraction of a dollar, I guess. Or wait, maybe the options are in whole numbers, so the minimum p is 235? But let me check the options.\n\nLooking at the options: A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nHmm, 234.2857 is approximately 234.29. So the minimum price would have to be $235, but that's not one of the options. Wait, did I make a mistake in my calculations?\n\nWait, let me recheck the steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the total production cost. Let me recompute that.\n\nEach month, they make 420 units. Each costs $110, so monthly cost is 420 * 110 = 46,200. That's correct.\n\nYearly, that's 46,200 * 12 = 554,400. Correct.\n\nTotal revenue per year is 5040 * p.\n\nSo profit is 5040p - 554,400 >= 626,400.\n\nSo 5040p >= 626,400 + 554,400 = 1,180,800.\n\nSo p >= 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nAnother approach: Let's divide numerator and denominator by 1000 to simplify.\n\nWait, 5040 = 5.04 * 1000.\n\n1,180,800 = 1.1808 * 10^6.\n\nSo 1.1808e6 / 5.04e3 = (1.1808 / 5.04) * 10^3.\n\nWait, 1.1808 /5.04. Let me compute that.\n\n5.04 goes into 1.1808 how many times?\n\nWait, 5.04 * 0.234 = ?\n\n5.04 * 0.2 = 1.008.\n\n5.04 * 0.034 = 0.17136.\n\nSo 1.008 + 0.17136 = 1.17936.\n\nThat's very close to 1.1808.\n\nSo 0.234 *5.04 is approximately 1.17936, which is just under 1.1808.\n\nThe difference is 1.1808 - 1.17936 = 0.00144.\n\nSo 0.00144 /5.04 = 0.0002857.\n\nSo approximately 0.234 + 0.0002857 = 0.2342857.\n\nSo 0.2342857 * 10^3 is 234.2857.\n\nSo p >= 234.2857. So the minimum price is $235, but the options don't have 235. The closest higher option is 240 (option C). But wait, let me see if I did the calculation correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should double-check the initial approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's compute the required selling price per month to get the desired profit.\n\nWait, another way: The company needs a total profit of $626,400 per year. So the total profit per year is 626,400.\n\nThe profit per unit is (selling price) - (production cost per unit). Because each unit is sold at p, and cost is 110. So profit per unit is p-110.\n\nTotal profit per year is 420 units/month * 12 months * (p - 110) = 5040*(p-110).\n\nWait, 5040*(p-110) >= 626,400.\n\nSo 5040*(p -110) >= 626,400.\n\nDivide both sides by 5040:\n\np - 110 >= 626,400 / 5040.\n\nCompute 626400 /5040.\n\nHmm, let me calculate 5040 * 124 = 5040*(120 +4) = 5040*120=604,800, plus 5040*4=20,160. So 604,800 +20,160=624,960. That's less than 626,400.\n\nWhat about 125? 5040 * 125= 630,000. Because 5040*100=504,000; 5040*25=126,000. 504,000 +126,000=630,000. Which is more than 626,400.\n\nSo 626,400 /5040 is between 124 and 125.\n\nCompute 5040 * 124 = 624,960.\n\n626,400 -624,960=1,440.\n\nSo 1,440 /5040 = 0.2857.\n\nSo 124.2857.\n\nSo p -110 >= 124.2857.\n\nSo p >= 110 + 124.2857 = 234.2857.\n\nAgain, same result as before.\n\nSo p must be at least approximately $234.29. Since the selling price must be a whole number (I think the options are in whole dollars), the next higher whole number is $235. But looking at the options, the closest higher option is 240 (option C). Wait, but let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, 234.29 is between 230 and 240. So the next possible price is 235, but it's not an option. The next higher option is 240, which is C.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the minimum price to guarantee the profit. So if 234.29 is the minimum, but the options don't have 235, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute 5040 * 234.2857 to see if it's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the calculation must be exact. Let me compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nLet me perform the division step by step.\n\n5040 into 1,180,800.\n\nFirst, see how many times 5040 fits into 1,180,800.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 1000: 1180800 /5040 = 1180.8 /5.04.\n\nWait, 5.04 times 234 is 5.04 *200=1008, 5.04*34=171.36. So 1008 +171.36=1179.36. Hmm, 1179.36 is less than 1180.8.\n\nThe difference is 1180.8 -1179.36=1.44.\n\nSo 5.04 * x = 1.44, where x is 1.44/5.04=0.2857.\n\nSo 234 +0.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo p is 234.2857. So the price needs to be at least 234.29. Since the options don't have this, perhaps the correct option is 240, but let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial equation.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's compute the required price per unit based on the per-month calculation.\n\nThe company needs a yearly profit of 626,400.\n\nSo monthly profit needed is 626400 /12 = 52,200.\n\nEach month, the company sells 420 units. Their cost each month is 420*110=46,200.\n\nSo monthly profit is (420p -46200) =52,200.\n\nSo 420p -46200 =52200.\n\nSo 420p =52200 +46200=98400.\n\nSo p =98400/420.\n\nLet me compute that: 98400 \u00f7420.\n\n420 = 42 *10.\n\n98400 \u00f7420 = (98400 \u00f742) \u00f710.\n\nCompute 98400 \u00f742.\n\n42 *2340 = 42*(2000)=84,000, 42*340=14,280. So 84,000 +14,280=98,280. Hmm, but 42*2340=98,280, which is less than 98,400.\n\nWait, 98,400 -98,280=120.\n\nSo 42*2340=98,280.\n\nPlus 42* (120/42)= 42*2.857\u2248120.\n\nWait, 120 \u00f742 is 2 and 36/42, which is 2.857.\n\nSo 2340 + 2.857\u22482342.857.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because 420p =98400 \u2192 p=98400/420.\n\nWait, 98400 \u00f7420 = let's compute it as 98400 \u00f7420.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 60: 98400/60=1640; 420/60=7.\n\nSo 1640 \u00f77 \u2248234.2857.\n\nWhich is the same result as before.\n\nSo p must be at least 234.2857, which is approximately $234.29.\n\nBut the options given are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo 234.29 is between 230 and 240. So the minimum price from the options that is higher than 234.29 is 240. So option C.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check: if the price is 230, what's the profit?\n\nAt 230 per unit:\n\nRevenue per month: 420 *230 = 96,600.\n\nCost per month:46,200.\n\nProfit per month:96,600-46,200=50,400.\n\nYearly: 50,400 *12=604,800.\n\nBut 604,800 is less than 626,400. So not enough.\n\nIf price is 240:\n\nRevenue per month:420 *240=100,800.\n\nProfit per month:100800-46200=54,600.\n\nYearly:54,600 *12=655,200.\n\nWhich is more than 626,400. So 240 is sufficient.\n\nWhat about 234.29? Let's compute the profit.\n\nIf p=234.29, then revenue per month is 420 *234.29.\n\n420 *234 = 98,280; 420 *0.29=121.8. So total is 98,280 +121.8=98,401.8.\n\nProfit per month:98,401.8 -46,200=52,201.8.\n\nWhich is just over 52,200, so yearly would be exactly 52,201.8 *12=626,421.6, which is more than 626,400.\n\nSo the correct price is $234.29. But since the options don't have this, the next higher option is 240.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be done on a per-unit basis, considering that the profit per unit is (p -110), and the total number sold per year is 5040.\n\nSo, 5040*(p -110) >=626,400.\n\nSo, p -110 >=626400 /5040.\n\nCompute 626400 \u00f75040.\n\nHmm, 5040 * 124 = 624,960.\n\n5040 *124 = 624,960.\n\n626,400 -624,960 =1,440.\n\n1,440 \u00f75040 = 0.2857.\n\nSo, p -110 >=124.2857 \u2192 p >= 234.2857.\n\nSo, again, the same result.\n\nBut the options don't have 234.29, so the minimum price from the options is 240 (option C).\n\nSo the correct answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we start by analyzing the company's costs and revenues.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **Monthly Production**: 420 units.\n2. **Production Cost per Unit**: $110.\n3. **Yearly Profit Target**: $626,400.\n4. **Revenue per Month**: \\( 420 \\times p \\), where \\( p \\) is the selling price per unit.\n5. **Monthly Cost**: \\( 420 \\times 110 = 46,200 \\) dollars.\n6. **Yearly Cost**: \\( 46,200 \\times 12 = 554,400 \\) dollars.\n7. **Yearly Revenue**: \\( 420 \\times 12 \\times p = 5040 \\times p \\).\n\n### Profit Equation:\nThe profit for the year is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = \\text{Yearly Revenue} - \\text{Yearly Cost}\n\\]\n\\[\n5040p - 554,400 \\geq 626,400\n\\]\n\n### Solving for \\( p \\):\n1. Rearrange the equation:\n   \\[\n   5040p \\geq 626,400 + 554,400\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   5040p \\geq 1,180,800\n   \\]\n2. Divide both sides by 5040:\n   \\[\n   p \\geq \\frac{1,180,800}{5040}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   p \\geq 234.2857\n   \\]\n\n### Interpretation:\nThe minimum selling price per unit must be at least $234.29 to meet the profit target. However, since the options provided are in whole numbers, the next higher whole number is $240.\n\n### Verification:\n- At \\( p = 240 \\):\n  - **Yearly Revenue**: \\( 5040 \\times 240 = 1,209,600 \\)\n  - **Yearly Profit**: \\( 1,209,600 - 554,400 = 655,200 \\), which exceeds the target of $626,400.\n\n- At \\( p = 230 \\):\n  - **Yearly Revenue**: \\( 5040 \\times 230 = 1,159,200 \\)\n  - **Yearly Profit**: \\( 1,159,200 - 554,400 = 604,800 \\), which is less than the target.\n\nThus, the minimum selling price from the given options that guarantees the required profit is **$240**.\n\nAnswer: C",
