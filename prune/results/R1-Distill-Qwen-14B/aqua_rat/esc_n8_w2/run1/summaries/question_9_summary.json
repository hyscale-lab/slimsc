      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session?\n\nThe options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.\n\nHmm. So, we're dealing with sets here, right? Like, two groups: those who went to prom and those who debated. And we need to find the maximum number of students who didn't do either. That's the neither group.\n\nWait, let me think. The total number of students is 200. So, if I can find how many students are in both the prom and debating, or just one of them, that might help.\n\nThe problem gives minimums. At least 45% went to prom. So 45% of 200 is 90 students. So, at least 90 attended prom. Similarly, at least 35% took part in debating. 35% of 200 is 70. So at least 70 debated.\n\nWait, so the minimums are 90 and 70 respectively. But to find the maximum number of students who did neither, we want as few as possible students to have done either. Or wait, maybe the other way around. Because the maximum number who did neither would be when the overlap between the two groups is as large as possible. Because if the two groups have a lot of overlap, then the total number of students in either group is minimized, leaving more students who did neither.\n\nRight. So, to maximize the number of students who didn't attend prom or debate, we need to minimize the number of students who attended prom or debated. And the way to minimize the number of students in either group is to maximize the overlap between the two groups.\n\nWait, how does that work? Let me think. The principle is from set theory. The formula for the union of two sets is |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|.\n\nSo the number of students who attended prom or debated is |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. Since we want |A \u222a B| to be as small as possible, to leave as many students as possible in the neither group, we need to maximize |A \u2229 B|.\n\nBecause subtracting a larger number (the overlap) will give a smaller union.\n\nSo, the maximum possible overlap is when as many students as possible are in both groups. But how much can that overlap be?\n\nThe maximum overlap can't be more than the smaller of the two groups. Because if, say, 90 students went to prom, the maximum possible overlap with the debating group is 70, because the debating group has at least 70. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the minimum number of students in each group is given. So the prom group has at least 90, and the debate group has at least 70.\n\nSo the maximum possible overlap is when all 70 debate students are also in the prom group. But wait, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the prom group is at least 90. So it could be more than 90, but since we're trying to minimize the union, we can assume the prom group is exactly 90. Similarly, the debate group is exactly 70.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the maximum possible overlap is when the debate group is entirely within the prom group. So in that case, the number of students in the union would be 90 + 70 - 70 = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Because if all 70 debate students are also in prom, then the union is just the prom group, which is 90.\n\nWait, but wait, that would mean that 90 students are in prom (and some of them, 70, also debated). So the union is 90. But then, how many students are in neither group?\n\nTotal students: 200.\n\nSo, 200 - union = 200 -90=110. So the maximum number of students who didn't attend either is 110.\n\nWait, but 110 is one of the options, option E. But wait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"at least\" 45% attended prom and \"at least\" 35% debated. So the numbers given are minimums. So the actual numbers could be higher.\n\nWait, but to find the maximum number who did neither, we want the union (prom or debate) to be as small as possible. So the union is minimized when the overlap is maximized.\n\nSo, the smallest possible union would be when the two groups have as much overlap as possible.\n\nSo, the minimum possible union is |A| + |B| - total, but wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, |A| is 90, |B| is 70. The maximum possible overlap is the minimum of |A| and |B|, so 70. So |A \u2229 B| can be up to 70.\n\nWait, no. Because the prom group is 90, and the debate group is 70. So all 70 debate students could be in the prom group, which would make the union 90. Because 90 are in prom, and 70 in debate, but 70 of those are already in prom. So total unique students is 90.\n\nSo the union is 90. So the number of students who didn't attend either is 200 -90=110.\n\nSo that's the maximum possible. But wait, is that allowed? Because if the debate group is entirely within prom, then the minimum for the debate group is 70, which is satisfied. And the prom group is exactly 90, which is the minimum. So that's acceptable.\n\nBut wait, another angle: if the union is 90, that's the minimal possible union, which allows the maximum number of students (110) to have done neither. So the answer should be 110, which is option E.\n\nWait, but the options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.\n\nSo option E is 110.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because the minimum number in prom is 90, and the minimum in debate is 70. So the maximum possible overlap is 70 (all debate students are in prom). So the union is 90. Then, 200-90=110.\n\nSo the maximum number of students who could have neither is 110.\n\nWait, but why is 99 one of the options? Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the maximum with another scenario. Let me think differently. Suppose that the number of students who attended prom is exactly 90, and those who debated are exactly 70. But what if some students attended neither?\n\nWait, the maximum number of students who did neither is when the number of students who did either is as small as possible. So to get that, the union has to be as small as possible.\n\nSo, to minimize the union, we maximize the overlap. So, the maximum possible overlap is when the 70 debate students are all included in the 90 prom students. So the union is 90.\n\nSo, 200-90=110. So that's the maximum number who did neither. So E is correct.\n\nBut wait, another way to think: the maximum number of students who did neither is the total minus (number in prom + number in debate - number in both). So to maximize the neither, we need to minimize the union, which is done by maximizing the overlap.\n\nSo, the maximum overlap is the minimum of the two sets, which is 70. So |A \u2229 B| can't be more than 70.\n\nSo, |A \u222a B| = 90 +70 -70=90.\n\nSo, 200-90=110. So the answer is E.\n\nBut wait, the options have E as 110, so that must be the correct answer.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again carefully. It says there are 200 students in a school. At least 45% attended the prom night, and at least 35% took part in the debating session. The question is asking for the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debating session. The options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.\n\nHmm, I think I need to figure out how many students could have done neither, so that would mean the minimum number who attended at least one of the two events, right? Because to maximize the 'neither' group, I want as few as possible students attending either event. But wait, the problem says \"at least\" 45% and \"at least\" 35%. So that means the numbers for prom and debating are minimums.\n\nWait, so if at least 45% went to prom, that's 90 students because 45% of 200 is 90. Similarly, at least 35% took part in debating, which is 70 students (since 35% of 200 is 70). Now, to find the maximum number of students who didn't attend either, I should find the maximum possible overlap between the two groups. Because if more students attended both, then fewer students would have attended only one or the other, which would allow more students to have done neither.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The formula is |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. So the total number of students who attended at least one event is |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. But since we're looking for the maximum number of students who didn't attend either, we need to minimize |A \u222a B|.\n\nAh, right, to minimize the number of students who attended at least one event, I need to maximize the overlap between A and B. So |A \u2229 B| should be as large as possible. What's the maximum possible value for |A \u2229 B|? It can't be larger than the smaller of |A| and |B|. So |A| is 90, |B| is 70, so the maximum overlap is 70.\n\nWait, so if 70 students attended both, then the number who attended either prom or debate is 90 +70 -70 =90. So that's 90 students. Therefore, the number of students who attended neither is 200 -90=110. But wait, the options don't have 110 as a possible maximum? Wait, looking at the options, E is 110. But wait, wait, that can't be right because the numbers are at least 45% and 35%. So if the maximum possible overlap is 70, then the minimum number attending either is 90. So 200-90=110. But that seems high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, but 45% is the minimum for prom, 35% for debate. So the actual numbers could be higher, right? So if more students attended prom than 90, or more attended debate than 70, the overlap could be higher, but wait, that's not possible because the maximum overlap is limited by the smaller set. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimum number of students attending either event is 90 +70 -200 = 60? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, let me recall: the minimum possible value of |A \u222a B| is |A| + |B| - N, where N is the total. So 90 +70 -200=60. So the minimum number attending at least one is 60. So the maximum number who neither attended is 200 -60=140. But 140 isn't one of the options. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The problem asks for the maximum number who could have neither attended prom nor debating. So to maximize that number, we need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one event. The minimum number of students who attended either is the sum of the two minimums minus the maximum possible overlap.\n\nWait, the formula for the minimum of |A \u222a B| is |A| + |B| - N, but that only works if |A| + |B| > N, otherwise it's zero. So in this case, 90 +70 =160, which is less than 200, so the minimum |A \u222a B| is 160 -200= negative, but that can't be. So the minimum is zero? No, that's not right. Wait, I'm confused now.\n\nWait, no. The minimum number of students attending either event is when the overlap is maximum. So the maximum possible |A \u2229 B| is the minimum of |A| and |B|. So |A \u2229 B| can't be more than 70, since |B|=70. So the minimum |A \u222a B| is 90 +70 -70=90. So the minimum number attending either event is 90. So the maximum number of students who neither attended prom nor debate is 200-90=110. Which is option E.\n\nWait, but wait another second. The problem says \"at least 45% attended prom\" and \"at least 35% debated.\" So the actual numbers could be higher than 90 and 70, respectively. For example, suppose 100 students went to prom, and 80 debated. Then the maximum overlap would be 80, so the union would be 100+80 -80=100. Then neither would be 100, but that's higher than 110. Wait, that's not possible because 100 is less than 110. Wait, no, 200-100=100, which is more than 110? No, 100 is less than 110, so 200-100=100 is less than 110. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. To maximize the number of students who did neither, we need as few as possible to have attended either event. So the minimum number attending either event is when the overlap is as large as possible. So when as many as possible students are in both events.\n\nSo the minimum number in the union is |A| + |B| - N, but only if |A| + |B| > N. Wait, but in our case, 90+70=160 <200, so the minimum number in the union is 90 +70 -200= -40. That doesn't make sense, so the minimum is zero? No, that's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimum number in the union is max(|A|, |B|). Because if all of B is within A, then the union is just |A|. So in our case, |A| is 90, |B| is70. So if all 70 in B are also in A, the union is 90. So the minimum possible |A \u222a B| is 90. So the maximum number who didn't attend either is 200-90=110. So option E is 110.\n\nBut wait, the problem is phrased as \"at least 45%\" and \"at least 35%.\" So the actual numbers could be higher than 90 and 70. For instance, if 100 students went to prom and 80 debated, then the minimum union would be 100 +80 -80=100. So the number of students who neither attended would be 100. But that's less than 110, so the maximum is still 110 when the numbers are at their minimums.\n\nSo the maximum number of students who could have neither is 110, which is option E.\n",

So that means the numbers for prom and debating are minimums.\n\nWait, so if at least 45% went to prom, that's 90 students because 45% of 200 is 90. Similarly, at least 35% took part in debating, which is 70 students (since 35% of 200 is 70). Now, to find the maximum number of students who didn't attend either, I should find the maximum possible overlap between the two groups. Because if more students attended both, then fewer students would have attended only one or the other, which would allow more students to have done neither.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The formula is |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. So the total number of students who attended at least one event is |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. But since we're looking for the maximum number of students who didn't attend either, we need to minimize |A \u222a B|.\n\nAh, right, to minimize the number of students who attended at least one event, I need to maximize the overlap between A and B. So |A \u2229 B| should be as large as possible. What's the maximum possible value for |A \u2229 B|? It can't be larger than the smaller of |A| and |B|. So |A| is 90, |B| is 70, so the maximum overlap is 70.\n\nWait, so if 70 students attended both, then the number who attended either prom or debate is 90 +70 -70 =90. So that's 90 students. Therefore, the number of students who attended neither is 200 -90=110. But wait, the options don't have 110 as a possible maximum? Wait, looking at the options, E is 110. But wait, wait, that can't be right because the numbers are at least 45% and 35%. So if the maximum possible overlap is 70, then the minimum number attending either is 90. So 200-90=110. But that seems high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, but 45% is the minimum for prom, 35% for debate. So the actual numbers could be higher, right? So if more students attended prom than 90, or more attended debate than 70, the overlap could be higher, but wait, that's not possible because the maximum overlap is limited by the smaller set. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimum number of students attending either event is 90 +70 -200 = 60? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, let me recall: the minimum possible value of |A \u222a B| is |A| + |B| - N, where N is the total. So 90 +70 -200=60. So the minimum number attending at least one is 60. So the maximum number who neither attended is 200 -60=140. But 140 isn't one of the options. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The problem asks for the maximum number who could have neither attended prom nor debating. So to maximize that number, we need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one event. The minimum number of students who attended either is the sum of the two minimums minus the maximum possible overlap.\n\nWait, the formula for the minimum of |A \u222a B| is |A| + |B| - N, but that only works if |A| + |B| > N, otherwise it's zero. So in this case, 90 +70 =160, which is less than 200, so the minimum |A \u222a B| is 160 -200= negative, but that can't be. So the minimum is zero? No, that's not right. Wait, I'm confused now.\n\nWait, no. The minimum number of students attending either event is when the overlap is maximum. So the maximum possible |A \u2229 B| is the minimum of |A| and |B|. So |A \u2229 B| can't be more than 70, since |B|=70. So the minimum |A \u222a B| is 90 +70 -70=90. So the minimum number attending either event is 90. So the maximum number of students who neither attended prom nor debate is 200-90=110. Which is option E.\n\nWait, but wait another second. The problem says \"at least 45% attended prom\" and \"at least 35% debated.\" So the actual numbers could be higher than 90 and 70, respectively. For example, suppose 100 students went to prom, and 80 debated. Then the maximum overlap would be 80, so the union would be 100+80 -80=100. Then neither would be 100, but that's higher than 110. Wait, that's not possible because 100 is less than 110. Wait, no, 200-100=100, which is more than 110? No, 100 is less than 110, so 200-100=100 is less than 110. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. To maximize the number of students who did neither, we need as few as possible to have attended either event. So the minimum number attending either event is when the overlap is as large as possible. So when as many as possible students are in both events.\n\nSo the minimum number in the union is |A| + |B| - N, but only if |A| + |B| > N. Wait, but in our case, 90+70=160 <200, so the minimum number in the union is 90 +70 -200= -40. That doesn't make sense, so the minimum is zero? No, that's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimum number in the union is max(|A|, |B|). Because if all of B is within A, then the union is just |A|. So in our case, |A| is 90, |B| is70. So if all 70 in B are also in A, the union is 90. So the minimum possible |A \u222a B| is 90. So the maximum number who didn't attend either is 200-90=110. So option E is 110.\n\nBut wait, the problem is phrased as \"at least 45%\" and \"at least 35%.\" So the actual numbers could be higher than 90 and 70. For instance, if 100 students went to prom and 80 debated, then the minimum union would be 100 +80 -80=100. So the number of students who neither attended would be 100. But that's less than 110, so the maximum is still 110 when the numbers are at their minimums.\n\nSo the maximum number of students who could have neither is 110, which is option E.\n\n\nTo determine the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we analyze the given data:\n\n1. **Total number of students**: 200.  \n2. **Minimum number of students who attended the prom**: At least 45% of 200, which is \\( 0.45 \\times 200 = 90 \\).  \n3. **Minimum number of students who participated in the debating session**: At least 35% of 200, which is \\( 0.35 \\times 200 = 70 \\).  \n\nTo maximize the number of students who neither attended the prom nor the debating session, we need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one of the events. This occurs when the overlap between the two groups is as large as possible. The maximum overlap is limited by the smaller of the two groups, which is 70 (the number of students who debated).  \n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion:  \n\\[\n|A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|\n\\]  \nSubstituting the values:  \n\\[\n|A \\cup B| = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90\n\\]  \nThus, the minimum number of students who attended at least one event is 90.  \n\nThe maximum number of students who neither attended the prom nor the debating session is:  \n\\[\n200 - |A \\cup B| = 200 - 90 = 110\n\\]  \n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is **110**, which corresponds to option **E**.\n\nAnswer: E",
