      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully. \n\nThe question says that a club has members whose ages are in an arithmetic progression (A.P.). The common difference is 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old. The sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find how many members are in the club, and the options are from 18 to 27.\n\nHmm, arithmetic progression. So the ages go like 7, 7.25, 7.5, and so on, each time adding 3 months. Wait, 3 months is a quarter of a year, so 0.25 years. So the common difference, d, is 0.25 years.\n\nWait, the first term, a, is 7 years. The sum of the ages is 250. So I need to find the number of terms, n, in this A.P. where the sum is 250.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an A.P. is S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d]. \n\nLet me plug in the values. \n\nSo S = 250, a = 7, d = 0.25. So:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets first. 2*7 is 14. Then (n-1)*0.25 is 0.25n -0.25. So adding them together: 14 + 0.25n -0.25 = 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nSo the equation becomes 250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n). Let me multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n500 = 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2\n\nLet's rearrange this into a standard quadratic equation form. Move 500 to the right:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n\nHmm, quadratic equation. Let me write it as:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n\nMaybe it's easier to eliminate the decimals. Multiply each term by 4 to get rid of the 0.25:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\nWait, let me check that. 0.25 *4 =1, 13.75 *4=55, -500*4= -2000. So yes, equation is n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nNow I can apply the quadratic formula. The quadratic is an\u00b2 + bn + c =0, so a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nThe formula is n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a)\n\nCalculating discriminant D: b\u00b2 -4ac = 55\u00b2 -4*(1)*(-2000) = 3025 +8000 = 11025.\n\nSquare root of 11025 is, let me think. 105\u00b2 is 11025 because 100\u00b2=10000, 105\u00b2=10000+2*100*5 +5\u00b2= 10000+1000+25=11025. So sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo, n = [ -55 \u00b1 105 ] / 2\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because the number of members can't be negative. So:\n\nn = ( -55 + 105 ) / 2 = (50)/2 =25.\n\nSo n=25. Let me check if that's one of the options. The options are A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27. So yes, option C is 25. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nWait, let's compute the sum when n=25. \n\nThe sum S = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]\n\na=7, d=0.25, n=25.\n\nSo S = 25/2 [14 + 24*0.25]\n\n24 *0.25 is 6. So 14 +6=20.\n\n25/2 *20 = (25 *20)/2 = (500)/2=250. Oh, that's correct. So yes, n=25 is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be option C)25.\n",

The youngest is 7 years old, and the total sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find the number of members. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's get the facts straight. The ages are in AP with a common difference of 3 months. So each next member is 3 months older than the previous. The first term of the AP is the youngest member's age, which is 7 years. Wait, but the common difference is in months, so maybe I should convert everything into months to avoid confusion. Or perhaps I can work in years, but then I have to handle the 3 months as 0.25 years. Hmm, either way, but maybe working in months would be easier to prevent any decimal issues.\n\nLet me try converting all ages to months. The youngest is 7 years, which is 7 * 12 = 84 months. The common difference is 3 months. So each member's age increases by 3 months from the previous.\n\nThe sum of all ages is 250 years. Wait, wait, the sum is given in years. Oh, but the individual ages are in months? Or are they in years? Wait, the problem says the ages are in AP, but the common difference is 3 months. So the first term is 7 years, which is 7.0 years, and each subsequent term is 0.25 years (since 3 months is a quarter of a year) more than the last. So perhaps it's better to work in years.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in years. Let me rephrase the problem.\n\nThe ages form an AP with the first term a =7 years. Common difference d= 3 months = 0.25 years. The sum S of n terms is 250 years.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an AP is S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d]. So I can plug in the values.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nSimplify the equation. Let's compute each part.\n\n2*7 is 14. (n-1)*0.25 is 0.25n -0.25. So the term inside the brackets becomes 14 + 0.25n -0.25 = 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nSo the equation is 250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n500 =13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2\n\nLet me rearrange the equation to standard quadratic form:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 =0\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic in n. To make it easier, multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the decimal:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n - 2000 =0\n\nWait, let's double-check that multiplication.\n\n0.25 *4=1, 13.75*4=55, -500*4= -2000. So yes, the equation becomes n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for n. The quadratic formula is n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2-4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nCalculating the discriminant D:\n\nD = 55^2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 +8000 = 11025\n\nThe square root of 11025 is... let me think. 105^2 is 11025 because 100^2 is 10000, 105^2 is 11025. Yes.\n\nSo sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo n = [ -55 \u00b1105 ]/(2*1) = (50)/2 or (-160)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, (-55 +105)/2 = (50)/2=25.\n\nSecond, (-55 -105)/2 = (-160)/2= -80.\n\nSince the number of members can't be negative, n=25 is the solution.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 25. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake when setting up the equation.\n\nWait, the sum of the ages is 250 years. So each term in the AP is in years, starting at 7, increasing by 0.25 each time. The number of terms is n.\n\nSo the formula is correct: S =n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]\n\nPlugging in, yes, that's 250 =n/2 [14 + 0.25(n-1)].\n\nWhich becomes 250 = (n/2)(13.75 +0.25n), as I did earlier.\n\nThen 500 =13.75n +0.25n\u00b2 \u2192 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500=0.\n\nMultiply by 4: n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nQuadratic solution gives n=25.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)25.\n",

Yes.\n\nSo sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo n = [ -55 \u00b1105 ]/(2*1) = (50)/2 or (-160)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, (-55 +105)/2 = (50)/2=25.\n\nSecond, (-55 -105)/2 = (-160)/2= -80.\n\nSince the number of members can't be negative, n=25 is the solution.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 25. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake when setting up the equation.\n\nWait, the sum of the ages is 250 years. So each term in the AP is in years, starting at 7, increasing by 0.25 each time. The number of terms is n.\n\nSo the formula is correct: S =n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]\n\nPlugging in, yes, that's 250 =n/2 [14 + 0.25(n-1)].\n\nWhich becomes 250 = (n/2)(13.75 +0.25n), as I did earlier.\n\nThen 500 =13.75n +0.25n\u00b2 \u2192 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500=0.\n\nMultiply by 4: n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nQuadratic solution gives n=25.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)25.\n\n\nThe ages of the club members form an arithmetic progression (AP) with the first term \\( a = 7 \\) years and a common difference \\( d = 3 \\) months, which is equivalent to \\( 0.25 \\) years. The sum of the ages of all members is given as \\( S = 250 \\) years. The goal is to find the number of members \\( n \\).\n\nThe formula for the sum of \\( n \\) terms of an AP is:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 2a + (n-1)d \\right]\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 2(7) + (n-1)(0.25) \\right]\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 14 + 0.25(n-1) \\right]\n\\]\n\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 14 + 0.25n - 0.25 \\right]\n\\]\n\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 13.75 + 0.25n \\right]\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n500 = n \\left[ 13.75 + 0.25n \\right]\n\\]\n\nExpand and rearrange into standard quadratic form:\n\n\\[\n500 = 13.75n + 0.25n^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.25n^2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n\\]\n\nMultiply through by 4 to eliminate decimals:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 55 \\), and \\( c = -2000 \\). Compute the discriminant:\n\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac = 55^2 - 4(1)(-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{11025} = 105\n\\]\n\nSubstitute into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-55 \\pm 105}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives two solutions:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-55 + 105}{2} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n = \\frac{-55 - 105}{2} = -80\n\\]\n\nSince the number of members cannot be negative, \\( n = 25 \\) is the valid solution. Therefore, the number of members in the club is **25**.\n\nAnswer: C",
