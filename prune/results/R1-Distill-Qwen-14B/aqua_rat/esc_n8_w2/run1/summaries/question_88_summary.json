      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the problem is about Raj and Rahim's ages. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on age problems, but I think I can work through it step by step.\n\nAlright, the question says that five years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. And now Raj is 17. We need to find out how old Rahim is now.\n\nWait, so right now, Raj is 17. That means five years ago, he was 17 minus 5, which is 12. Because 17 minus 5 is 12, right? So five years ago, Raj was 12.\n\nAnd at that same time, five years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. So if Raj was 12, which is one-third of Rahim's age back then, then we can set up an equation.\n\nLet me think. Let's say, let\u2019s denote Rahim's age five years ago as R. So, according to the problem, Raj's age five years ago (which is 12) is equal to (1/3) of R. So, 12 = (1/3)*R. To find R, I can multiply both sides by 3. That would give R = 12 * 3 = 36. Oh, wait, so five years ago, Rahim was 36 years old.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for Rahim's current age. So, if five years ago he was 36, now he must be 36 + 5. Let me calculate that. 36 plus 5 is 41. So, Rahim is 41 years old now.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 41. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let's make a timeline. Now, Raj is 17. Five years ago, he was 12. At that time, he was one-third as old as Rahim. So, 12 is a third of Rahim's age then. So, 12 *3 is 36. So five years ago, Rahim was 36. Now, 36 +5 is 41. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAnother way to look at it: Let\u2019s denote current ages. Let\u2019s say Raj's current age is Rr =17. Five years ago, he was Rr -5 =12. At that time, he was one-third as old as Rahim. So, if Rahim's current age is Rrahim, then five years ago he was Rrahim -5. So, 12 = (1/3)(Rrahim -5). Multiply both sides by 3: 36 = Rrahim -5. So Rrahim =41. Yep, same answer.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer is 41, which is option B.\n",

Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe problem says: If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back and Raj is 17 years old now, how old is Rahim now? The options are A)37, B)41, C)40, D)42, E)43.\n\nAlright, so I need to find Rahim's current age. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I know Raj's current age is 17. So, five years ago, Raj was 17 - 5 = 12 years old. That makes sense because if you subtract 5 from 17, you get 12.\n\nThe problem states that five years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim was at that time. So, if I let R represent Rahim's age five years ago, then Raj's age back then was (1/3)*R.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify: five years ago, Raj's age was 12, which was one-third of Rahim's age at that time. So, 12 equals (1/3) of R, where R is Rahim's age five years ago.\n\nSo, mathematically, that would be 12 = (1/3)*R. To find R, I can multiply both sides by 3. So, R = 12 * 3 = 36. That means five years ago, Rahim was 36 years old.\n\nNow, to find his current age, I just add 5 years to that. So, 36 + 5 = 41. So, Rahim is now 41 years old.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 41. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, Raj is 17 now, so five years ago he was 12. If Rahim was 36 five years ago, that means now he is 41. Let's check the ratio: 12 is one-third of 36. Yes, because 36 divided by 3 is 12. So everything adds up.\n\nHmm, any other way to think about this? Maybe setting up equations. Let me try that.\n\nLet R be Raj's current age (17) and H be Rahim's current age. Five years ago, Raj's age was R -5, which is 17-5=12. Five years ago, Rahim's age was H-5. According to the problem, 12 = (1/3)*(H-5).\n\nMultiply both sides by 3: 36 = H -5. So H = 36 +5=41. Yep, same result.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer is B)41.\n",
