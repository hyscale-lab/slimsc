      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Christopher and Jonathan flipping a coin. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nSo, the setup is that they flip a coin 20 times. Every time it's heads, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan. And if it's tails, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher. After all 20 flips, neither of them won or lost any money. So, they broke even. I need to find out how many times the coin landed on heads.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to model this. Each head results in a $2 transfer from Chris to Jonathan. Each tail is a $3 transfer the other way, from Jonathan to Chris. So, for each flip, depending on the outcome, money moves in one direction or the other.\n\nLet me define variables to make this clearer. Let's say the number of heads is H, and the number of tails is T. Since they flipped the coin 20 times, H + T must equal 20. That's one equation right there.\n\nNow, the net result is that neither gained nor lost money. So the total money Chris gave to Jonathan should equal the total money Jonathan gave to Chris. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. Each head, Chris gives $2. So total given by Chris is 2*H. Each tail, Jonathan gives $3, so he gives 3*T. Since they ended up with no net gain or loss, the amount Chris gave must equal what Jonathan gave.\n\nSo, 2H = 3T. Because the total from Chris (2H) equals the total to Chris (3T). That's another equation.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. H + T = 20\n2. 2H = 3T\n\nI can solve these two equations to find H.\n\nFrom equation 2, let's express H in terms of T. 2H = 3T => H = (3T)/2.\n\nBut since H and T must be whole numbers (you can't have half a flip), 3T must be even. So T has to be an even number because 3 is odd, so T must be even to make 3T even.\n\nNow, substitute H into equation 1.\n\nH + T = 20 => (3T/2) + T = 20.\n\nLet me compute that. (3T/2) + (2T/2) = (5T)/2 = 20.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 5T = 40 \u2192 T = 8.\n\nSo T is 8. Then H is 20 - T \u2192 20 -8 = 12.\n\nWait, let me check that. If H is 12, then 2H is 24. T is 8, so 3T is 24. Yes, 24 equals 24. That checks out.\n\nSo the number of heads is 12. Looking at the options, E is 12. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again.\n\nTotal flips: 20.\n\nH + T =20.\n\nNet money: 2H (Chris gives) =3T (Jonathan gives). So 2H=3T.\n\nSo H = (3/2) T.\n\nSubstituting into H + T =20: (3/2 T) + T = 20 \u2192 (5/2 T)=20 \u2192 T= (20 *2)/5=8. So H=12.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer is 12, which is option E.\n",
