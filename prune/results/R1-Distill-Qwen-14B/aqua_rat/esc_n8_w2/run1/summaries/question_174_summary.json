      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about tires and costs. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is about figuring out the percentage difference in the average cost per year between buying new tires and repairing the current ones. \n\nAlright, let's see. The problem says that new tires last for four years and cost $180 each. The customer can either buy new ones or repair the current tires for $40 each, which makes them last an extra year. So, the repair extends their life from four years to five years, right? Or wait, no, wait. Wait, when you buy new tires, they last four years. If you repair the current ones, they last one additional year beyond their original lifespan. So if the original tires were already, say, four years old, then repairing would make them last for five years total? Or maybe the original tires are being repaired, so perhaps they were already some years old and now get an extra year. Hmm, but the problem says, \"when purchased new, last for four years.\" So the new tires are four years, and repairing the current ones gives an extra year, so they last for one more year than they would have otherwise. So, if the customer had, say, two years left on their current tires, repairing would add one more year, making it three years? Or wait, no, maybe the repair makes them last for one additional year regardless of their current condition. So, if you repair, you add a year to their life. But the problem says \"the current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So, if the tires are already, say, three years old, they would now last four years? Or maybe they're in any state, and the repair adds a year. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify the current age of the tires. So perhaps the question is assuming that the current tires are about to last for a certain number of years, and the repair extends that.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's read the problem again. The customer can choose to buy new tires at $180 each, which last four years, or repair the current tires at $40 each, which adds one more year to their life. So, the repair makes the current tires last one more year than they would have otherwise. So, for example, if the current tires would last two more years without repair, they'd last three after repair. But wait, the problem says when the tires are new, they last four years. So the new tires are four years. The repair is for the current (old) tires, which I'm assuming have been in use for some time. So, perhaps the current tires have, say, two years left, and after repair, they last three. Or maybe the repair doesn't depend on their current condition and just adds one year regardless. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's better to model it as the repair giving an additional year beyond their original lifespan. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the tires as being new when you buy them, but the customer is considering whether to repair their current tires or buy new ones. So, if the customer buys new tires, they get four years of use. If they repair their current tires, which are presumably not new anymore, they can get one more year of use. Hmm, but the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year, not that the tires are new again. So, if the current tires are X years old, and repair adds one year, making them X+1 years old. But without repair, they would last X years. So, in that case, the average cost per year is the repair cost divided by the total lifespan after repair.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is simpler. Let me approach it step by step.\n\nThe question is asking about the average cost per year for each option. So, we need to calculate the average cost per year for new tires and for repaired tires, then find the percentage increase from the repaired cost to the new cost.\n\nSo, first, the new tire option: cost is $180 per tire, lasts four years. So, the average cost per year is 180 / 4 = $45 per year.\n\nNext, the repair option: cost is $40 per tire. The repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, if the tires were going to last Y years without repair, they now last Y+1 years. But wait, the problem doesn't specify Y. Hmm, but perhaps the current tires are already in use, and without repair, they would last for a certain number of years, but the problem doesn't say. Oh wait, the problem says that when purchased new, they last four years. So, if the customer is considering whether to repair the current tires, which are not new anymore. So, perhaps the current tires are, say, four years old, and without repair, they would last another four years? No, that can't be right because the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So, perhaps the current tires have already been in use for some time, and without repair, they would last for one more year, but the repair adds another year. Wait, no, that would make the total two years. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The problem states that when purchased new, they last four years. So, perhaps the customer is considering whether to replace their tires now. If they buy new tires, they will last four years. Alternatively, they can repair their current tires, which are perhaps not new, and this repair will make them last for one more year than they would without the repair. But without knowing how much longer the current tires would last without repair, how can we compute the average cost?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the repair doesn't add a year but makes them last for an additional year beyond their original four years. So, for example, if the tires are new, they last four years. If they're repaired, they last five years. But that's not the case because the problem says the customer can choose to have their current tires repaired. So, perhaps the current tires are, say, three years old, and without repair, they would last one more year (total four years). With repair, they last two more years (total five years). So, in that scenario, the average cost per year for the repair would be $40 divided by two years, which is $20 per year.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't give the current age of the tires. Hmm. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the current tires are about to fail, meaning they have zero life left, and the repair gives them one more year. But that doesn't make sense because if they're about to fail, you wouldn't repair them. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires have some life left, and the repair adds an extra year. But without knowing how much life they have left, it's impossible to calculate. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires are being repaired, and the repair adds one year to their lifespan regardless of their current state. So, for example, if they were already three years old, and without repair, they would last one more year, making four years total. But with repair, they would last two more years, making five years. So, the average cost per year would be $40 divided by two years, which is $20 per year. But wait, the problem says when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, if the current tires are, say, four years old, and you repair them, they would last five years. So, the cost is $40 for five years, which is $8 per year. But then, if they are new, they would last four years, so without repair, the customer would have to buy new tires for four years. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is assuming that the customer's current tires are about to last for one more year, and the repair extends that to two years. So, the current tires would last one more year without repair, and two years with repair. So, the average cost per year would be 40 divided by two, which is $20 per year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the average cost per year is calculated differently. Let's think of each option as a choice for the same period. For example, the customer is considering what to do now, and whether to buy new tires or repair the current ones. If they buy new tires, they'll have them for four years. If they repair, they can get one more year of use from their current tires. But wait, that's not the same time frame.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is considering the cost per year for each option over their respective lifespans. So, for the new tires, it's 180 / 4 = 45 per year. For the repair, the cost is 40, and the lifespan is five years (since it's one additional year beyond the original four? Or wait, no. If the repair adds one year to the current tires, which are already, say, four years old, then the repair makes them last five years. So, the cost is 40 for five years. So, 40 /5 = 8 per year. Then, the new tires are 45 per year, which is 45 /8 = 5.625 times higher. So, 5.625 is 562.5% higher? That can't be right because the options don't go that high. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the current tires have been in use for some time, and the repair adds one more year beyond their current state. But without knowing how much time they have left, I can't calculate the average cost. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires are new, and the customer is considering whether to buy new tires or repair them. If the tires are new, and you repair them, they'll last five years. But why would you repair new tires? That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the current tires are not new. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires are four years old, and without repair, they would last another four years (so total eight years). But that's not what the problem says. The problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So, the current tires are old, and without repair, they have some life left, and the repair extends that by one year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the current tires have been used for four years, and now, the customer is deciding whether to repair them or buy new. So, if they repair them, they'll last one more year (total five years from purchase), and then the customer would have to buy new again. But that's not quite clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply that the repair adds one year to the tires' life, regardless of their current state. So, if you repair, the tires will last for one more year. So, the total lifespan after repair is one year. But that seems unlikely because if you have a tire that's already been used for four years, adding one more year would be a very short lifespan. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be simpler. Let's think of each option as a way to get a certain number of years of use. The new tires give four years for $180. The repair gives one additional year for $40. So, perhaps the customer is considering whether to repair their current tires (which are about to fail) to get one more year, or buy new tires for four years. But in that case, the average cost per year would be 180/4=45 for new, and 40/1=40 for repair. Then, the question is, the average cost of new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repair.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the question is about the average cost per year. If the repair gives one more year, then the average cost per year is 40 /1 =40. So, new tires cost 45 per year, which is 5 more than 40. So, 5/40 is 0.125, which is 12.5%. So, the average cost of new tires is 12.5% higher than the cost of repairing. So, the answer would be C)12.5%.\n\nWait, but that would be the case if the repair only gives one year. But the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, if the current tires are about to last for, say, x years without repair, then with repair, they'll last x+1 years. But without knowing x, how can we compute the average cost per year? That's the confusion here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the current tires are in their fourth year, so they have one year left without repair, and the repair adds one more, making two years. So, the average cost per year for repair would be 40 /2=20. So, new tires are 45 per year, which is 22.5% higher than 20. But that's not one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the current tires have been used for some time, and the repair adds one year. But the problem doesn't specify their current age, so perhaps it's intended that the repair extends the current tires' life to five years. Wait, but why five? Because if the original was four years, and repair adds one, then five.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are four years old, and without repair, they would last one more year (so total five years). With repair, they last two more years (total six). No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should go back to the problem statement and see if I can rephrase it.\n\nThe problem says: Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\n\nWait, the key here is that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, the current tires, if not repaired, would last for their original lifespan, which is four years when new. But if the customer already has current tires, perhaps they are old and have been used for some time. So, the repair adds one more year to their lifespan.\n\nBut without knowing how much life they have left, we can't calculate the average cost per year. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the current tires have no life left, and the repair gives them one more year. But that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the repair extends the current tires' lifespan by one year, making their total lifespan five years. So, the average cost per year for repair would be 40 /5 =8. The new tires' average cost per year is 180 /4=45. So, 45 compared to 8. The question is, how much greater is 45 than 8 in percentage.\n\nSo, the increase is 45 -8 =37. So, 37 is what percent of 8? 37/8 =4.625, which is 462.5% higher. But that's not one of the options. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. The problem is comparing the average cost per year of the new tires versus the cost of repairing. So, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires now, which will last four years, or repair their current tires now, which will make them last one additional year beyond their current lifespan. But without knowing their current lifespan, it's impossible to compute the average cost.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the current tires are already four years old, and the repair adds one more year, making their lifespan five years. So, the customer can choose between:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires now for $180, which will last four years. So, average cost per year is 180/4=45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires now for $40, which will make them last one more year (so total five years from when they were new). So, the repair is done now, adding one year to their lifespan. So, they have five years of use for $40. So, average cost per year is 40 /5=8.\n\nThen, the question is, 45 is what percent greater than 8. So, (45-8)/8 =37/8=4.625, which is 462.5% greater. But that's not an option. So, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the current tires are about to last for one more year without repair, and the repair adds another year, making it two years. So, the average cost per year for repair is 40 /2=20. Then, new tires are 45. So, 45 is what percent greater than 20. The increase is 25, so 25/20=1.25=125%. But that's not an option either.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the problem differently. Perhaps the question is considering that the customer's current tires are four years old, and they can either buy new tires (which last four years) or repair the current ones, which would make them last one additional year beyond their current age. So, the current tires are four years old, and with repair, they last five years. So, the average cost per year is 40 /5=8. So, new tires: 180/4=45. So, 45 is 45/8=5.625 times the cost of repair. So, the percentage increase is (45-8)/8=37/8=4.625, which is 462.5% higher. But none of the options are close to that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer has current tires that have been in use for four years and are about to fail. So, without repair, they have zero years left. Repairing them gives one more year. So, the average cost per year for repair is 40/1=40. For new tires, it's 180/4=45. So, 45 is 5 more than 40. 5/40=0.125=12.5% higher. So, the answer would be C)12.5%.\n\nThat makes sense. Because if the current tires are about to fail (so zero years left), the repair gives one more year. So, average cost per year for repair is 40. For new tires, it's 45. So, 45 is 12.5% higher than 40.\n\nSo, the answer would be C)12.5%.\n",

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is assuming that the customer's current tires are about to last for one more year, and the repair extends that to two years.

But wait, that's not the same time frame.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is considering the cost per year for each option over their respective lifespans. So, for the new tires, it's 180 / 4 = 45 per year. For the repair, the cost is 40, and the lifespan is five years (since it's one additional year beyond the original four? Or wait, no. If the repair adds one year to the current tires, which are already, say, four years old, then the repair makes them last five years. So, the cost is 40 for five years. So, 40 /5 = 8 per year. Then, the new tires are 45 per year, which is 45 /8 = 5.625 times higher. So, 5.625 is 562.5% higher? That can't be right because the options don't go that high. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the current tires have been in use for some time, and the repair adds one more year beyond their current state.

So, if they repair them, they'll last one more year (total five years from purchase), and then the customer would have to buy new again. But that's not quite clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply that the repair adds one year to the tires' life, regardless of their current state. So, if you repair, the tires will last for one more year. So, the total lifespan after repair is one year. But that seems unlikely because if you have a tire that's already been used for four years, adding one more year would be a very short lifespan. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be simpler. Let's think of each option as a way to get a certain number of years of use. The new tires give four years for $180. The repair gives one additional year for $40. So, perhaps the customer is considering whether to repair their current tires (which are about to fail) to get one more year, or buy new tires for four years. But in that case, the average cost per year would be 180/4=45 for new, and 40/1=40 for repair. Then, the question is, the average cost of new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repair.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the question is about the average cost per year. If the repair gives one more year, then the average cost per year is 40 /1 =40. So, new tires cost 45 per year, which is 5 more than 40. So, 5/40 is 0.125, which is 12.5%. So, the average cost of new tires is 12.5% higher than the cost of repairing. So, the answer would be C)12.5%.\n\nWait, but that would be the case if the repair only gives one year. But the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, if the current tires are about to last for, say, x years without repair, then with repair, they'll last x+1 years. But without knowing x, how can we compute the average cost per year? That's the confusion here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the current tires are in their fourth year, so they have one year left without repair, and the repair adds one more, making two years. So, the average cost per year for repair would be 40 /2=20. So, new tires are 45 per year, which is 22.5% higher than 20. But that's not one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the current tires have been used for some time, and the repair adds one year. But the problem doesn't specify their current age, so perhaps it's intended that the repair extends the current tires' life to five years. Wait, but why five? Because if the original was four years, and repair adds one, then five.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are four years old, and without repair, they would last one more year (so total five years). With repair, they last two more years (total six). No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should go back to the problem statement and see if I can rephrase it.\n\nThe problem says: Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\n\nWait, the key here is that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, the current tires, if not repaired, would last for their original lifespan, which is four years when new. But if the customer already has current tires, perhaps they are old and have been used for some time. So, the repair adds one more year to their lifespan.\n\nBut without knowing how much life they have left, we can't calculate the average cost per year. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the current tires have no life left, and the repair gives them one more year. But that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the repair extends the current tires' lifespan by one year, making their total lifespan five years. So, the average cost per year for repair would be 40 /5 =8. The new tires' average cost per year is 180 /4=45. So, 45 compared to 8. The question is, how much greater is 45 than 8 in percentage.\n\nSo, the increase is 45 -8 =37. So, 37 is what percent of 8? 37/8 =4.625, which is 462.5% higher. But that's not one of the options. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. The problem is comparing the average cost per year of the new tires versus the cost of repairing. So, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires now, which will last four years, or repair their current tires now, which will make them last one additional year beyond their current lifespan. But without knowing their current lifespan, it's impossible to compute the average cost.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the current tires are already four years old, and the repair adds one more year, making their lifespan five years. So, the customer can choose between:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires now for $180, which will last four years. So, average cost per year is 180/4=45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires now for $40, which will make them last one more year (so total five years from when they were new). So, the repair is done now, adding one year to their lifespan. So, they have five years of use for $40. So, average cost per year is 40 /5=8.\n\nThen, the question is, 45 is what percent greater than 8. So, (45-8)/8 =37/8=4.625, which is 462.5% greater. But that's not an option. So, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the current tires are about to last for one more year without repair, and the repair adds another year, making it two years. So, the average cost per year for repair is 40 /2=20. Then, new tires are 45. So, 45 is what percent greater than 20. The increase is 25, so 25/20=1.25=125%. But that's not an option either.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the problem differently. Perhaps the question is considering that the customer's current tires are four years old, and they can either buy new tires (which last four years) or repair the current ones, which would make them last one additional year beyond their current age. So, the current tires are four years old, and with repair, they last five years. So, the average cost per year is 40 /5=8. So, new tires: 180/4=45. So, 45 is 45/8=5.625 times the cost of repair. So, the percentage increase is (45-8)/8=37/8=4.625, which is 462.5% higher. But none of the options are close to that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer has current tires that have been in use for four years and are about to fail. So, without repair, they have zero years left. Repairing them gives one more year. So, the average cost per year for repair is 40/1=40. For new tires, it's 180/4=45. So, 45 is 5 more than 40. 5/40=0.125=12.5% higher. So, the answer would be C)12.5%.\n\nThat makes sense. Because if the current tires are about to fail (so zero years left), the repair gives one more year. So, average cost per year for repair is 40. For new tires, it's 45. So, 45 is 12.5% higher than 40.\n\nSo, the answer would be C)12.5%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage difference in the average cost per year between purchasing new tires and repairing the current tires, we analyze the costs and lifespans of each option.\n\n1. **New Tires**:  \n   - Cost per tire: $180  \n   - Lifespan: 4 years  \n   - Average cost per year:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Repairing Current Tires**:  \n   - Cost per tire: $40  \n   - Repair extends the lifespan by 1 additional year.  \n   - Assuming the current tires are about to fail (0 years of life left), the repair provides a total lifespan of 1 year.  \n   - Average cost per year:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Percentage Increase**:  \n   The question asks for the percentage increase in the average cost per year of new tires compared to repairing the current tires.  \n   - The difference in costs:  \n     \\[\n     45 - 40 = 5\n     \\]  \n   - The percentage increase:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{5}{40} = 0.125 = 12.5\\%\n     \\]\n\nThus, the average cost per year of new tires is **12.5% greater** than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about tire costs and figuring out the percentage difference in average cost per year between buying new tires and repairing the old ones. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that new tires last for four years and cost $180 each. Alternatively, you can repair the current tires for $40 each, which adds one more year to their life. The question is asking by what percentage the average cost per year of new tires is greater than repairing.\n\nFirst, I think I need to calculate the average cost per year for both options. Let me start with the new tires. Each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the number of years. That would be 180 divided by 4. Let me do that calculation: 180 / 4 = 45. So the average cost per year for new tires is $45.\n\nNow, for the repair option. The customer can repair their current tires for $40 each, and this repair makes the tires last one more year. Wait, so how long do the repaired tires last? The problem states that when purchased new, the tires last four years. If you repair them, they last an additional year. So original lifespan is four years, and with repair, it's five years? Or is it that each repair adds a year, but perhaps the initial lifespan isn't given? Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years.\" So new tires last four years. The customer can choose to have his current tires repaired at $40 per tire, which makes them last for one additional year. Oh, so the current tires, before repair, have some remaining life. But wait, the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is thinking of replacing the tires now, and the alternative is to repair them so they last an extra year. But how much longer would they last beyond that? Or perhaps, when you repair, it adds one more year to their life. So if the tires were going to last, say, three years more without repair, then with repair, they last four more years? No, the problem says the repair makes them last for one additional year, so perhaps the repair adds one year to their current lifespan.\n\nWait, but the problem isn't clear on the current lifespan of the tires before repair. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me reread the question.\n\nThe question says: \"A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nAh, so the current tires are being used, and by repairing them, they get an extra year. So the current tires' lifespan is being extended by one year. So if the tires were, say, going to last for x more years without repair, then with repair, they last x+1 years.\n\nBut wait, without knowing x, perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the current tires are new? No, that doesn't make sense because the customer is considering replacing them. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they would only last for one more year. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem says that when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps when a customer buys them, they last four years. So if the customer has had the tires for some time, perhaps they have a certain amount of life left. But the problem doesn't specify how much time is left. So maybe the alternative is that the customer has the option to repair the current tires, which would make them last one more year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already in use, and without repair, they would only last for one more year. So the repair adds one more year to their lifespan, making it two years? Or maybe the original lifespan is four years, and the repair adds one year to that, making it five years.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that when purchased new, they last four years. The customer's current tires may be, for example, two years old, so they have two more years of life left. If they repair, they get an additional year, so three years left.\n\nBut without knowing the current age, perhaps the problem is assuming that the current tires have zero life left, and the repair gives them one more year. That can't be right because then the customer would be getting one year for $40, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires have already been used for a certain period, and the repair adds one more year beyond that.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is intended to have the customer choose between buying new tires (which last four years) or repairing their current tires (which have, say, three years left, and repair adds one more year, making four years). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires have already been in use for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year, but repairing extends that by one more year, making a total of two years.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. Perhaps the problem is considering that the current tires have just one year left, so without repair, they would last one more year. If you repair them for $40, they last an additional year, making two years total. But that doesn't align with the four-year lifespan of new tires. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are new, and the customer is considering either replacing them now or repairing them to make them last longer.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem is structured such that the customer is considering two options for their tires:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180 each, which will last four years. So the average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45 per year.\n\nOption 2: Repair their current tires for $40 each, which extends their life by one year. So, the question is, how many years do the tires last after repair?\n\nWait, the problem says that without repair, the current tires would last for a certain amount of time. But the problem doesn't specify. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are already in their fourth year and are about to fail, so without repair, they would last one more year, and with repair, they last two years.\n\nWait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think in terms of total cost per year for each option.\n\nFor the new tires: cost is $180, life is four years. So average per year is 180 /4 =45.\n\nFor the repair: cost is $40, and the life is one more year. Wait, but that can't be right because that would make the average cost per year 40 per year, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the repair adds one year to the current lifespan, which might be three years, making four years. Or maybe the current tires have a certain life, and the repair adds one year to that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the repair is done once, and it adds one year. So, for example, if the current tires have three years of life left, repair for $40 makes them last four years. But without knowing the remaining life, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simpler than that. Perhaps the customer is considering replacing the tires now, and the alternative is to repair them so that they last for one additional year beyond their current lifespan. But without knowing how much longer they'd last, perhaps the problem is assuming that the current tires have just one year of life left, so without repair, they last one year, and with repair, they last two years. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires (which last four years) or repair the existing ones, which would allow them to last an additional year beyond their current lifespan. But without knowing the current lifespan, perhaps the problem is implying that the repair makes the tires last for one year, but that doesn't make sense because the new tires last four years.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already three years old, so they have one year left. Repairing them would add one more year, making their total lifespan four years. So, in this case, the repair would cost $40 for four years of use. But wait, the original tires were three years old and would have one more year. Repairing for $40 would make them last two more years? Or one more? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to model it without knowing the current lifespan.\n\nLet me try to think about it this way: when you repair the current tires, you pay $40 and get an extra year of life. So, regardless of how much life they have left, you're adding one year. So, the total life after repair is (current life) +1 years.\n\nBut without knowing the current life, how can we compute the average cost per year? Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is designed so that the customer is choosing between two options: buy new tires now, or repair the current tires and get one more year. So, perhaps the current tires are about to fail, and without repair, they would last zero more years. But that can't be right because repair adds one year, so the total life would be one year, costing $40, which averages to $40 per year. But that can't be right because new tires would average $45 per year, which is less than the repair option. But the problem says the new tires are more expensive per year, which can't be the case if new tires are $45 per year and repair is $40 per year.\n\nWait, that can't be. So perhaps the current tires have a certain lifespan left, say, three years, and with repair, they last four years. Let me model it that way.\n\nSo, let's assume that without repair, the tires have three years left. So, the customer can choose to pay $40 to get an extra year, making the total lifespan four years. So, the total cost is $40 for four years, so average cost per year is 40 /4 = $10 per year.\n\nAlternatively, buying new tires for $180 would last four years, so 180/4 = $45 per year.\n\nWait, but that would mean the new tires are more expensive per year than the repair. The question is asking by what percentage the average cost of new tires is greater than the repair. So, (45 - 10)/10 *100% = 350% increase, which isn't one of the options. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm not approaching this correctly. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nAh, so the customer's current tires can be repaired for $40 each, which adds one year to their lifespan. So the current tires' lifespan is their original lifespan (four years) minus the time they've already been used. But the problem doesn't specify how much time they've been used. So perhaps the current tires have been used for x years, and without repair, they would last (4 - x) years. Repairing adds one year, making it (4 -x +1) years.\n\nBut without knowing x, perhaps the problem is assuming that the customer is considering repairing the current tires as an alternative to buying new ones. So, perhaps the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they would last zero years, and with repair, they last one year. But that would make the average cost per year for repair $40, and new tires would be $45, which would be a 12.5% increase. But let me check.\n\nWait, if the customer's current tires are about to fail, without repair, they have zero life left. Repairing for $40 gives them one more year. So, the average cost per year for repair is $40 /1 = $40 per year.\n\nBuying new tires: $180 for four years, so $45 per year.\n\nSo, the average cost per year for new tires is $45, and for repair, it's $40.\n\nSo, the question is, by what percent is 45 greater than 40?\n\nThe formula for percentage increase is ((new - old)/old)*100%.\n\nSo, (45-40)/40 *100% = (5/40)*100% = 12.5%.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 12.5%, so that's the answer.\n\nWait, but that's only if the current tires have zero life left, which seems a bit odd. Because normally, you wouldn't repair tires that are about to fail; you'd replace them. But perhaps the problem is structured this way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the current tires have three years of life left, and repairing adds one more year, making four years. So, the total cost is $40 for four years. So, average cost per year is 40/4=10.\n\nNew tires: 180/4=45.\n\nSo, 45 is 350% higher than 10, which isn't an option. So that can't be.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial assumption is that the current tires have zero life left, and repair gives one year.\n\nSo, the answer is 12.5%, which is option C.\n",

But without knowing how much longer they'd last, perhaps the problem is assuming that the current tires have just one year of life left, so without repair, they last one year, and with repair, they last two years. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires (which last four years) or repair the existing ones, which would allow them to last an additional year beyond their current lifespan. But without knowing the current lifespan, perhaps the problem is implying that the repair makes the tires last for one year, but that doesn't make sense because the new tires last four years.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already three years old, so they have one year left. Repairing them would add one more year, making their total lifespan four years. So, in this case, the repair would cost $40 for four years of use. But wait, the original tires were three years old and would have one more year. Repairing for $40 would make them last two more years? Or one more? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to model it without knowing the current lifespan.\n\nLet me try to think about it this way: when you repair the current tires, you pay $40 and get an extra year of life. So, regardless of how much life they have left, you're adding one year. So, the total life after repair is (current life) +1 years.\n\nBut without knowing the current life, how can we compute the average cost per year? Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is designed so that the customer is choosing between two options: buy new tires now, or repair the current tires and get one more year. So, perhaps the current tires are about to fail, and without repair, they would last zero more years. But that can't be right because repair adds one year, so the total life would be one year, costing $40, which averages to $40 per year. But that can't be right because new tires would average $45 per year, which is less than the repair option. But the problem says the new tires are more expensive per year, which can't be the case if new tires are $45 per year and repair is $40 per year.\n\nWait, that can't be. So perhaps the current tires have a certain lifespan left, say, three years, and with repair, they last four years. Let me model it that way.\n\nSo, let's assume that without repair, the tires have three years left. So, the customer can choose to pay $40 to get an extra year, making the total lifespan four years. So, the total cost is $40 for four years, so average cost per year is 40 /4 = $10 per year.\n\nAlternatively, buying new tires for $180 would last four years, so 180/4 = $45 per year.\n\nWait, but that would mean the new tires are more expensive per year than the repair. The question is asking by what percentage the average cost of new tires is greater than the repair. So, (45 - 10)/10 *100% = 350% increase, which isn't one of the options. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm not approaching this correctly. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nAh, so the customer's current tires can be repaired for $40 each, which adds one year to their lifespan. So the current tires' lifespan is their original lifespan (four years) minus the time they've already been used. But the problem doesn't specify how much time they've been used. So perhaps the current tires have been used for x years, and without repair, they would last (4 - x) years. Repairing adds one year, making it (4 -x +1) years.\n\nBut without knowing x, perhaps the problem is assuming that the customer is considering repairing the current tires as an alternative to buying new ones. So, perhaps the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they would last zero years, and with repair, they last one year. But that would make the average cost per year for repair $40, and new tires would be $45, which would be a 12.5% increase. But let me check.\n\nWait, if the customer's current tires are about to fail, without repair, they have zero life left. Repairing for $40 gives them one more year. So, the average cost per year for repair is $40 /1 = $40 per year.\n\nBuying new tires: $180 for four years, so $45 per year.\n\nSo, the average cost per year for new tires is $45, and for repair, it's $40.\n\nSo, the question is, by what percent is 45 greater than 40?\n\nThe formula for percentage increase is ((new - old)/old)*100%.\n\nSo, (45-40)/40 *100% = (5/40)*100% = 12.5%.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 12.5%, so that's the answer.\n\nWait, but that's only if the current tires have zero life left, which seems a bit odd. Because normally, you wouldn't repair tires that are about to fail; you'd replace them. But perhaps the problem is structured this way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the current tires have three years of life left, and repairing adds one more year, making four years. So, the total cost is $40 for four years. So, average cost per year is 40/4=10.\n\nNew tires: 180/4=45.\n\nSo, 45 is 350% higher than 10, which isn't an option. So that can't be.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial assumption is that the current tires have zero life left, and repair gives one year.\n\nSo, the answer is 12.5%, which is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze both options:\n\n### Option 1: New Tires\n- **Cost**: $180 per tire  \n- **Lifespan**: 4 years  \n- **Average Cost per Year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\text{Total Cost}}{\\text{Lifespan}} = \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repairing Current Tires\n- **Cost**: $40 per tire  \n- **Additional Lifespan**: 1 year  \n- **Assumption**: The problem implies that the current tires are about to fail (0 years of life left), and repairing them extends their lifespan to 1 year.  \n- **Average Cost per Year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\text{Total Cost}}{\\text{Lifespan}} = \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Percentage Increase\nTo find the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we use the formula for percentage increase:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Cost} - \\text{Old Cost}}{\\text{Old Cost}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{45 - 40}{40} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{5}{40} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 12.5\\%\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe average cost per year of new tires is **12.5%** greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\nAnswer: C",
