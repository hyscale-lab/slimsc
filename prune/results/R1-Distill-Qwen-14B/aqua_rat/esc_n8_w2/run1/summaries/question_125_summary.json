      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a man rowing a boat, and I need to find his rate along the current. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nThe problem says the man rows at 4 kmph in still water. That means when there's no current, his speed is 4 km per hour. Now, when he's going against the current, his speed is 2 kmph. Wait, that's his effective speed against the current. So I guess the current is slowing him down when he's going upstream.\n\nLet me recall, in problems involving currents, the man's effective speed depends on whether he's going with the current or against it. If he's going upstream (against the current), his rowing speed minus the current's speed gives his effective speed. Conversely, if he's going downstream (along the current), his rowing speed plus the current's speed is his effective speed.\n\nSo, let's denote the man's rowing speed in still water as 'v', which is 4 kmph. Let the speed of the current be 'c'. \n\nWhen he's rowing against the current (upstream), his effective speed is v - c. The problem states that this is 2 kmph. So:\n\nv - c = 2\nWe know v is 4, so substituting that in:\n\n4 - c = 2\nSolving for c, we subtract 4 from both sides:\n-c = 2 -4 \u2192 -c = -2 \u2192 c = 2 kmph.\n\nWait, so the current is moving at 2 kmph? That makes sense because when he's going upstream, his effective speed is 2 kmph, which is 4 - 2 = 2.\n\nNow, the question asks for his rate along the current, which is downstream. So his effective speed would be v + c.\n\nv is 4, c is 2, so 4 + 2 = 6 kmph. So the man's downstream speed is 6 kmph.\n\nLooking at the options, I see option B is 6 kmph and option E is also 6. Wait, that's strange. Let me check the options again. Oh, maybe it's a typo. Because options B and E are the same. But perhaps I should proceed with the correct calculation.\n\nWait, the options are A)15, B)6, C)12, D)14, E)6. So both B and E are 6. That must be a mistake in the question, but I guess the correct answer would be 6, which is either B or E. But the options probably have only one correct letter. Maybe it's a mistake, but in the problem, the correct answer is 6 kmph.\n\nSo the correct option is B or E, but since both are same, perhaps the intended answer is B. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The man's speed in still water is 4. Against current speed is 2. So current is 2. So downstream speed is 4+2=6. Yes, that's correct.\n",
