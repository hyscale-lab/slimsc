      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question here where I need to add +45 and -30. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when you add positive and negative numbers, it's like subtracting. Oh wait, no, not exactly. Let me get this right.\n\nSo, adding a positive number is straightforward, but adding a negative is like subtracting. So +45 is positive, and -30 is negative. So when you add them together, it's like 45 plus (-30), which is the same as 45 minus 30. Wait, is that correct? Yeah, I think so because adding a negative is subtracting.\n\nSo, 45 minus 30. Let me do that. 45 take away 30 is 15. Oh wait, but wait, is the result positive or negative? Since 45 is larger than 30, the result should be positive, right? So 15 is the answer.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is +15. So the correct answer should be D. Let me double-check. 45 plus (-30) equals 15. Yeah, that makes sense. Another way to think about it is on a number line. Starting at 45 and moving 30 steps to the left (because it's negative) would land me at 15. So yeah, D is definitely the right choice.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nWhen adding +45 and -30, it is equivalent to 45 - 30, which equals 15. Since 45 is larger than 30, the result is positive. Therefore, the correct answer is **D) 15**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to add +45 and -30. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my math, but let me think it through.\n\nWait, adding positive and negative numbers. Right, I remember that when you add numbers with different signs, you subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger one and take the sign of the number with the larger absolute value. Oh wait, or is it the other way around? Let me get this straight.\n\nSo +45 is positive and -30 is negative. Their absolute values are 45 and 30 respectively. So 45 is bigger than 30. That means the result should take the sign of +45 because its absolute value is larger. So what's 45 minus 30? That's 15. So the answer should be positive 15. \n\nLooking at the options, option D is +15. So the answer must be D. But wait, let me double-check. Another way to look at it: adding a positive and a negative is like subtracting. So +45 -30 is the same as 45 -30, which is 15. Yeah, that makes sense. So definitely D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem of adding +45 and -30, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the signs and absolute values**:  \n   - The first number is +45 (positive), and its absolute value is 45.  \n   - The second number is -30 (negative), and its absolute value is 30.\n\n2. **Compare the absolute values**:  \n   - Since 45 > 30, the result will take the sign of the number with the larger absolute value, which is positive.\n\n3. **Subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger one**:  \n   - 45 - 30 = 15.\n\n4. **Apply the sign**:  \n   - The result is positive 15.\n\nThus, the final answer is +15, which corresponds to option D.\n\nAnswer: D",
