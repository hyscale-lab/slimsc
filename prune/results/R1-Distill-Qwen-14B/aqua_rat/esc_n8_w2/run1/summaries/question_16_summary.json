      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding P(A/B), which I think is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred. Oh wait, wait. No, actually, I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, the notation might be P(A given B), right? Because sometimes people use a slash or a vertical line for conditional probability.\n\nSo, the problem states that A and B are independent events. Oh right, independent events. So I remember that if two events are independent, the probability of both happening is the product of their individual probabilities. So P(A and B) would be P(A) * P(B). Got it.\n\nThe given probabilities are P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8. So, since they're independent, P(A \u2229 B) is 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16.\n\nNow, the question is asking for P(A/B). Wait, no, I think it's P(A|B). Because the slash is often used to denote conditional probability. So, P(A|B) is the probability that A occurs given that B has occurred.\n\nThe formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B). Oh wait, right, that's the formula. So since we already have P(A \u2229 B) as 0.16 and P(B) is 0.8, let's plug in the numbers.\n\nSo, 0.16 divided by 0.8. Let me calculate that. 0.16 / 0.8 equals 0.2. Oh, that's the same as P(A). That makes sense because if A and B are independent, then the occurrence of B doesn't affect the probability of A. So P(A|B) should equal P(A), which is 0.2.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 0.2. So that must be the correct answer. Let me just double-check the steps. A and B are independent, so P(A and B) is product of their probabilities. Then conditional probability is that product over P(B), which gives back P(A). Yep, that all adds up.\n",
