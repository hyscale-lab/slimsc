      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: A candidate secured 504 marks out of a maximum mark M. If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks. We need to find the value of M.\n\nHmm, so the candidate scored 504 in a system where the maximum is M. Then, if the system's maximum is changed to 800, his score becomes 420. So, his actual performance is the same, but the scaling has changed.\n\nWait, so the candidate's performance is being scaled from M to 800. That must mean that his percentage or ratio remains the same, but the total marks change. So, 504/M should be equal to 420/800. Because the ratio of his score to the maximum should stay the same when the maximum changes.\n\nLet me write that as an equation. So, 504/M = 420/800. I can cross-multiply to solve for M.\n\nSo, 504 * 800 = 420 * M.\n\nWait, let me compute that. 504 * 800. Let's see. 504 * 8 is 4032, so 504 * 800 is 403200. And 420 * M is 420M.\n\nSo, 403200 = 420M.\n\nTo find M, I divide both sides by 420.\n\nM = 403200 / 420.\n\nLet me calculate that. 403200 divided by 420. Hmm.\n\nWell, 420 times 1000 is 420,000. That's more than 403,200. So let's see, maybe 960? Because 420 * 960. Wait, no, wait, I'm trying to find 403200 / 420.\n\nWait, perhaps simplifying the division. Let's see, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 420's factors. Let's see.\n\nWait, 420 is 42 *10, and 403200 is 4032 * 100. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can divide numerator and denominator by 420's factors. Let's see, 420 is 60 *7, 60 is 12*5, etc. Alternatively, perhaps divide numerator and denominator by 420.\n\nWait, 403200 \u00f7 420.\n\nLet me compute 420 times 960 is 403,200. Wait, yes. Because 420 * 900 is 378,000, and 420 * 60 is 25,200. Adding them gives 378,000 +25,200=403,200. So 420*960=403200. So M=960.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 960. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So when M is 960, the candidate scored 504. The ratio is 504/960. Let me compute that.\n\n504 \u00f7 960. Let me simplify. Both are divisible by 24. 504 \u00f724 is 21, 960 \u00f724 is 40. So 21/40. 21 divided by 40 is 0.525, so 52.5%.\n\nNow, when the maximum is converted to 800, the score is 420. 420/800 = 0.525, which is the same as 52.5%. So yes, the ratios match. So M is indeed 960, which is option E.\n",

Then, if M is converted into 800 marks, the candidate would have 420. I need to find the value of M.\n\nHmm, wait. So when M is converted to 800, the candidate's score changes from 504 to 420. That probably means there's a proportional relationship here. Like, the ratio of the candidate's marks to the maximum remains the same before and after the conversion.\n\nLet me think about how to set up the equation. The original scenario is 504/M. When M is changed to 800, the candidate's score is 420, so that's 420/800. These two ratios should be equal because they're just scaling the maximum marks, so the proportion should stay the same.\n\nSo, I can write the equation as 504/M = 420/800. \n\nNow, I need to solve for M. Let's cross-multiply. 504 * 800 = M * 420. \n\nCalculating 504 * 800. Let me break that down. 500*800 is 400,000, and 4*800 is 3,200. So adding them gives 403,200. So 403200 = 420 * M.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, cross-multiplying, I get 504 * 800 = M * 420. So 403200 = 420 M. To find M, I divide both sides by 420.\n\nSo M = 403200 / 420. Let me compute that. Hmm, 403200 divided by 420. Let's see, 420 goes into 403200 how many times?\n\nWell, 420 * 900 is 378,000. Subtract that from 403,200: 403,200 - 378,000 = 25,200.\n\nNow, 420 goes into 25,200 exactly 60 times because 420*60=25,200.

Let me see, 420 is 42 *10, which is 6*7*10. 403200 is 4032 * 100. Hmm, 4032 divided by 42. Let me calculate that.\n\n42 times 96 is 4032 because 42*90=3780, 42*6=252. 3780 +252=4032. So 4032 \u00f742=96. So 403200 \u00f7420= (403200 \u00f742) \u00f710. 403200 \u00f742 is (4032 \u00f742) *100=96 *100=9600. Then divide by 10: 9600 \u00f710=960. So yes, same result.\n\nSo M=960.
