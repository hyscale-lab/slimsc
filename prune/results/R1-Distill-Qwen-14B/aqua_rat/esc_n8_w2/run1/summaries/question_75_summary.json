      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a picket fence, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe problem says: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?\n\nHmm, so I need to find the total length of the fence in feet. The options are given, but I should figure it out myself first.\n\nFirst, let's think about how the fence is constructed. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide, and between each pair of pickets, there's a 6-inch space. So, the fence is made up of pickets and spaces in between them.\n\nWait, but if there are x pickets, how many spaces are there? Oh right, for x pickets, the number of spaces between them is x-1. Because imagine two pickets: one space between them. Three pickets have two spaces, and so on. So if there are x pickets, the number of spaces is x-1.\n\nEach picket is 1/2 inch, so the total width of all pickets is x multiplied by 1/2 inch. That's (x * 1/2) inches.\n\nEach space is 6 inches, and there are (x-1) spaces. So the total space taken up by the gaps is 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nAdding these together gives the total length in inches. So total length in inches = (x * 1/2) + (6*(x-1)).\n\nLet me compute that. Let's expand that equation.\n\n(x/2) + 6x -6.\n\nWait, let me calculate that properly. 6*(x-1) is 6x -6. Then adding x/2.\n\nSo combining terms, x/2 +6x is (0.5x +6x)=6.5x. Then subtract 6. So total length is 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nBut wait, 6.5 is equal to 13/2. So 6.5x is (13x)/2. So total length is (13x/2) -6 inches.\n\nBut the question asks for the length in feet. Oh right, because 1 foot is 12 inches. So I need to convert inches to feet by dividing by 12.\n\nSo, the total length in feet is [ (13x/2 -6) ] inches divided by 12. So that's (13x/2 -6)/12 feet.\n\nHmm, let me simplify that. Let's split it into two terms: (13x/2)/12 - 6/12.\n\nWhich is 13x/(2*12) - 0.5. 2*12 is 24, so 13x/24. And 6/12 is 0.5, which is 1/2.\n\nWait, but let me write it as fractions. 6 is 6/1, so 6/12 is 1/2.\n\nSo the expression becomes (13x/24) - (1/2) feet.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nTotal picket width: x * (1/2) inches = x/2 inches.\n\nTotal space: 6 inches * (x-1) spaces = 6(x-1) inches.\n\nTotal in inches: x/2 +6(x-1) = x/2 +6x -6.\n\nCombine like terms: (6x + 0.5x) =6.5x, which is 13x/2. So 13x/2 -6 inches.\n\nConvert to feet: (13x/2 -6) / 12 = (13x/2)/12 -6/12 = 13x/(24) - 0.5.\n\nHmm, but looking at the options, option E is (13x-12)/24. Let's see if that's the same as what I have.\n\nWait, let me compute 13x/24 minus 0.5. 0.5 is 12/24. So 13x/24 -12/24 = (13x -12)/24.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the total length is (13x -12)/24 feet.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is (13x -12)/24. So the correct answer should be E.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nAnother approach: Let's take x=2 pickets.\n\nEach picket is 0.5 inches, so two pickets are 1 inch wide. Between them, one space of 6 inches. So total is 1 +6 =7 inches, which is 7/12 feet.\n\nLet me plug x=2 into each option to see which gives 7/12.\n\nOption A: 13*2/2=13. 13 feet is way more than 7 inches, so no.\n\nOption B: 13*2/2 -6 =13-6=7 inches. But 7 inches is correct in inches, but the question is in feet. So 7 inches is 7/12 feet. Let's compute option B: 7 inches equals 7/12 feet. So when x=2, option B gives 7 inches, which is correct in inches, but the question requires feet.\n\nWait, option B is (13x/2 -6). So for x=2, 13*2/2=13, minus 6 is 7 inches. But the answer is 7/12 feet. So option B gives 7 inches, but the question asks for feet, so we need to divide by 12. So option B is 7 inches, which is 7/12 feet. Let's see if option E gives the same.\n\nOption E: (13*2 -12)/24 = (26-12)/24 =14/24=7/12. So correct.\n\nSo when x=2, the correct answer is 7/12 feet. So option E gives 7/12.\n\nAnother test case: x=1. Then, how long is the fence? Only one picket, so 0.5 inches. Which is 0.5/12 feet.\n\nOption E: (13*1 -12)/24 = (13-12)/24 =1/24. Which is 0.5/12 feet? Wait, 1/24 is approximately 0.0417, and 0.5/12 is about 0.041666... So yes, same. So correct.\n\nSo I think option E is correct.\n",

Let's see if that's the same as what I have.\n\nWait, let me compute 13x/24 minus 0.5. 0.5 is 12/24. So 13x/24 -12/24 = (13x -12)/24.\n\nYes, that's correct.

I need to represent the total length in feet.\n\nWait, so each picket is 1/2 inch wide. If there are x pickets, the total width of the pickets alone would be x multiplied by 1/2 inch. But wait, there's also the spaces between them. Oh right, between each pair of pickets there's 6 inches. So how many spaces are there?\n\nIf there are x pickets, the number of spaces between them would be x minus one. Like, if there are two pickets, there's one space. So for x pickets, it's (x-1) spaces. Each space is 6 inches, so the total space is 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nSo the total length of the fence in inches would be the sum of the picket widths and the spaces. So that's (x * 1/2) + 6*(x-1). Let me write that out: 0.5x + 6(x-1).\n\nWait, I can expand that. 0.5x + 6x -6. Adding 0.5x and 6x gives 6.5x, so 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nBut the question asks for the length in feet. Oh right, because 1 foot is 12 inches. So I need to convert inches to feet by dividing by 12.\n\nSo (6.5x -6) inches divided by 12 gives the length in feet. Let me calculate that: (6.5x -6)/12.\n\nWait, 6.5 is the same as 13/2, right? So 6.5x is (13/2)x. So the numerator becomes (13/2)x -6. Hmm, maybe I can write that as (13x -12)/2, because 6 is 12/2.

So spaces total is 6*(x-1) = 6x-6 inches.\n\nTotal length in inches: x/2 +6x -6 = (x +12x)/2 -6. Wait, no, wait. x/2 is 0.5x, plus 6x is 6.5x. 6.5x minus 6 inches.\n\nConvert to feet: (6.5x -6)/12.\n\n6.5x is 13x/2. So (13x/2 -6) divided by 12. Which is (13x/2 -6) * (1/12) = (13x -12)/24.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the expression is (13x -12)/24 feet. Looking back at the options, option E is (13x-12)/24, which matches.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any steps. Another way to think: for x pickets, how many spaces? x-1. So each picket contributes 0.5 inches, each space 6 inches.\n\nTotal length = (0.5 * x) + (6*(x-1)) inches.\n\n= 0.5x +6x -6 = 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nConvert to feet: (6.5x -6)/12.\n\n6.5 is 13/2, so 13x/2 -6.

Wait, no, wait. x/2 is 0.5x, plus 6x is 6.5x. 6.5x minus 6 inches.\n\nConvert to feet: (6.5x -6)/12.\n\n6.5x is 13x/2. So (13x/2 -6) divided by 12. Which is (13x/2 -6) * (1/12) = (13x -12)/24.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the expression is (13x -12)/24 feet. Looking back at the options, option E is (13x-12)/24, which matches.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any steps. Another way to think: for x pickets, how many spaces? x-1. So each picket contributes 0.5 inches, each space 6 inches.\n\nTotal length = (0.5 * x) + (6*(x-1)) inches.\n\n= 0.5x +6x -6 = 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nConvert to feet: (6.5x -6)/12.\n\n6.5 is 13/2, so 13x/2 -6. Divided by 12 is (13x/2 -6)/12 = (13x -12)/24. Yes, that's the same as option E.\n\nSo the correct answer should be E.\n\n\nTo determine the length of the fence in feet, we start by analyzing the given parameters. The fence consists of \\( x \\) pickets, each \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\, \\text{inch} \\) wide, and \\( 6 \\, \\text{inches} \\) of space between each pair of pickets. \n\n### Step 1: Total width of the pickets\nThe total width of the pickets is:\n\\[\nx \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{x}{2} \\, \\text{inches}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Total space between the pickets\nBetween \\( x \\) pickets, there are \\( x - 1 \\) spaces. Each space is \\( 6 \\, \\text{inches} \\), so the total space is:\n\\[\n6 \\times (x - 1) = 6(x - 1) \\, \\text{inches}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Total length of the fence in inches\nThe total length of the fence in inches is the sum of the picket widths and the spaces:\n\\[\n\\text{Total length (inches)} = \\frac{x}{2} + 6(x - 1).\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\\[\n\\text{Total length (inches)} = \\frac{x}{2} + 6x - 6 = 6.5x - 6.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Convert to feet\nSince \\( 1 \\, \\text{foot} = 12 \\, \\text{inches} \\), we divide the total length in inches by \\( 12 \\) to convert it to feet:\n\\[\n\\text{Total length (feet)} = \\frac{6.5x - 6}{12}.\n\\]\nRewriting \\( 6.5 \\) as \\( \\frac{13}{2} \\), the expression becomes:\n\\[\n\\text{Total length (feet)} = \\frac{\\frac{13x}{2} - 6}{12} = \\frac{13x - 12}{24}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Match with the options\nThe derived expression \\( \\frac{13x - 12}{24} \\) matches option **E**. \n\nAnswer: E",
