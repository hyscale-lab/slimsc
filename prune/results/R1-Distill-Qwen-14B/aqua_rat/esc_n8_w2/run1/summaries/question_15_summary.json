      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question here about rearranging the letters in the word \"PROBLEC\" to make 7-letter words without any repeating letters. The options are A)2!, B)3!, C)7!, D)8!, E)9!.\n\nHmm, let me think. First, I need to figure out how many letters are in \"PROBLEC\". Let me count: P, R, O, B, L, E, C. That's 7 letters. So each letter is unique, no repeats. So if all letters are different, how many ways can they be arranged?\n\nI remember that when you have n distinct items, the number of permutations is n factorial, which is n! So for 7 letters, it should be 7! right? Let me calculate that. 7! is 7\u00d76\u00d75\u00d74\u00d73\u00d72\u00d71, which is 5040. So the total number of possible arrangements is 5040.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 7!, which would be 5040. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Could there be any trick here? The question says \"none of the letters repeat\", but since all letters are unique in \"PROBLEC\", any arrangement will automatically satisfy that condition. So yeah, no issues there. There's no letter that repeats, so all permutations are valid.\n\nSo yeah, the correct answer is 7!, which is option C.\n",

The options are from A to E, and I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the problem. First, I should check how many letters are in \"PROBLEM.\" Wait, wait, the word given is \"PROBLEC.\" Hmm, let me count the letters. P, R, O, B, L, E, C. Oh wait, that's 7 letters. So each letter is unique, right? So no letters are repeating in the original word.\n\nSince the question is about rearranging them into 7-letter words with no repeats, that makes sense because there are exactly 7 letters, each appearing once. So, it's a permutation problem where all letters are distinct.\n\nI remember that the number of ways to arrange n distinct items is n factorial, which is n! So for 7 letters, it should be 7! Let me think about that. 7! equals 7\u00d76\u00d75\u00d74\u00d73\u00d72\u00d71, which is 5040. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.\n\nWait, is there any possibility that the word has duplicate letters? Let me double-check \"PROBLEM.\" Oh wait, no, the word is \"PROBLEM\" but the question says \"PROBLEC.\" Oh wait, maybe I misread. Let me count again. P, R, O, B, L, E, M? Wait, no, wait, the word is \"PROBLEM,\" but the given word is \"PROBLEC.\" So that's 7 letters, but wait, is \"C\" in there? Let me see: P, R, O, B, L, E, C. Oh, so that's 7 letters, all unique.\n\nSo if all letters are unique, then the number of permutations is 7 factorial. So the answer should be 7!, which is option C.\n\nLooking at the options: A is 2!, which is 2. That's way too small. B is 3!, 6. Still too small. C is 7!, which is 5040. D is 8!, which is 40320, but that's for 8 letters. E is 9!, which is even bigger. So the correct choice is C, 7!.\n",
