      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars? Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nAlright, let me start by understanding what the question is asking. I'm given that 27 bottles cost A cents, and I need to find out the cost for B bottles, but the answer should be in dollars. So, I think I need to find the cost per bottle first and then multiply by B, then convert that into dollars.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me break it down. So, 27 bottles cost A cents. So, the cost per bottle in cents would be A divided by 27. Because if 27 bottles cost A cents, each one is A/27 cents.\n\nBut I need the total cost for B bottles. So, that would be B multiplied by the cost per bottle. So, B * (A/27) cents. But wait, the question asks for the cost in dollars, not cents. Oh right, because 1 dollar is 100 cents. So I need to convert cents to dollars.\n\nSo, the total cost in cents is (A*B)/27. To convert that into dollars, I divide by 100. So, the formula becomes (A*B)/(27 * 100) dollars. Which simplifies to (A*B)/2700 dollars.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is AB/2700. So that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the price per bottle is A cents for 27, so per bottle is A/27 cents. For B bottles, it's (A/27)*B cents. To convert cents to dollars, divide by 100. So (A*B)/(27*100) = AB/2700. Yep, that's the same as option A.\n\nAre there any other possible mistakes I might make here? Like, perhaps mixing up the multiplication or division. Let me think. If I have more bottles, the cost should increase. So, if B is bigger, the total cost should be higher. Option A has AB in the numerator, so that makes sense. If B increases, the total cost increases, which is correct.\n\nOther options: Let's briefly look at them. Option B is 27/(AB). That would give a smaller number as B increases, which doesn't make sense. Option C is AB/270, which is 10 times higher than option A. That would be incorrect because it's not converting to dollars properly. Option D is 2700/AB, which is the reciprocal, so that would give a smaller number as B increases, which is wrong. Option E is 100AB/27, which is way too big because it's not divided by 100 to convert to dollars.\n\nSo yeah, option A is the correct one.\n",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says, \"If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars?\" And then there are five options to choose from. Hmm.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. First, I need to find the cost per bottle, right? Because if 27 bottles cost A cents, then each bottle costs A divided by 27 cents. That makes sense.\n\nSo the cost per bottle is A/27 cents. Now, the question is asking about B bottles. So the total cost for B bottles would be B multiplied by the cost per bottle. That would be B * (A/27) cents. But wait, the question asks for the cost in dollars, not cents. Oh right, I need to convert cents to dollars. Since 1 dollar is 100 cents, I can divide the total cents by 100 to get dollars.\n\nSo putting it all together, the total cost in dollars is (B * A / 27) / 100. Let me write that as a fraction: (A * B) / (27 * 100). Which simplifies to AB/(2700). Wait, that looks like option A, which is AB/2700. But let me double-check.\n\nWait, no. Let me go through it again. So 27 bottles cost A cents. So one bottle is A/27 cents. For B bottles, it's B*(A/27) cents. To convert to dollars, divide by 100. So (B*A)/(27*100) = AB/(2700). So that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is AB/2700. That should be the right answer. Let me make sure none of the other options make sense.\n\nOption B is 27/(AB). That doesn't fit. Because our calculation is AB divided by something, not 27 over AB. So B is wrong.\n\nOption C is AB/270. Hmm, 270 is 27*10, but wait, 27*100 is 2700. So C is missing a factor of 10. So that's incorrect.\n\nOption D is 2700/AB. That would be if we took 2700 and divided by AB, which isn't what we did. We have AB over 2700, so D is the reciprocal, which is wrong.\n\nOption E is 100AB/27. That's way off because that's a larger number, and our calculation is AB/2700, which is a smaller number. So E is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: AB/2700.\n",
