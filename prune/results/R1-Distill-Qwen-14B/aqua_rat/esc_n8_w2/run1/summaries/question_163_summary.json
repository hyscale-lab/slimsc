      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\n\nHmm, so the man's current spending is 70% of his income. That means he saves or does something with the remaining 30%, right? But the question is about his new expenditure after his income goes up by 20%.\n\nWait, wait. Does his expenditure change when his income increases? I think I need to clarify that. The problem doesn't say anything about his spending habits changing, so I guess he continues to spend the same percentage of his new income as he did before. Or maybe it's a different scenario. Let me think.\n\nWait no, wait. Let me make sure. The initial statement is that he spends 70% of his income. So if his income increases, but his spending habits stay the same, he would still spend 70% of the new income. But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's break it down.\n\nLet me assign some numbers to make it easier. Let's say his original income is X. Then he spends 70% of X, which is 0.7X. Now, his income increases by 20%. So the new income is X plus 20% of X, which is X * 1.2, right? So new income is 1.2X.\n\nNow, if his spending remains at 70% of his income, then his new expenditure would be 0.7 * 1.2X. Let me calculate that: 0.7 * 1.2 is 0.84. So 0.84X. So as a percentage of his new income, his expenditure is 84%?\n\nWait, but wait a second. That can't be right because 84% is higher than 70%, which would mean he's spending a larger portion. But maybe that's correct because his income went up, but his expenses also went up proportionally. Or is there another way to interpret the question?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking what his new expenditure is as a percentage of his new income. Oh, but that's what I just did. So 0.7 * 1.2X is 0.84X, which is 84% of his original income, but as a percentage of his new income (1.2X), his expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2X / 1.2X. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the way I thought earlier is correct. The new income is 1.2X, and he spends 70% of that. So 0.7 * 1.2X = 0.84X. So the absolute expenditure increases, but as a percentage of the new income, it's still 70%, right? Because 0.84X is 70% of 1.2X. Because 70% of 1.2X is 0.84X.\n\nWait, so why is the question asking for the new expenditure? Oh, maybe I'm missing something. Because if he's spending the same proportion, 70%, then the percentage wouldn't change. But that's not one of the options. The options are A)58.3%, B)62.5%, etc. So that suggests that maybe I'm not understanding the question correctly.\n\nWait, maybe the question is not saying that his spending rate changes. Let me read again: the man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, what's his new expenditure? Oh, perhaps the question is asking what percentage of his new income does he spend, assuming his expenditure amount remains the same. Wait, that would be different.\n\nWait, no, the question says 'what will be his new expenditure', which probably refers to the percentage of income, not the absolute amount. So perhaps I was correct the first time, but the options don't match. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that his expenditure is fixed, and the income increases, so the percentage of income he spends decreases.\n\nWait, maybe I got the question wrong. Let me re-examine. The initial statement: he spends 70% of his income. So if his income is X, he spends 0.7X. Now, his income increases by 20%, making it 1.2X. But perhaps his expenditure also increases by 20%? Or maybe his expenditure is fixed, and the percentage changes.\n\nWait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me try to think of it in both ways.\n\nScenario 1: His expenditure increases by the same percentage as his income. So his income goes up by 20%, so his expenditure also goes up by 20% of the original expenditure.\n\nOriginal expenditure: 0.7X. 20% increase: 0.7X * 1.2 = 0.84X. So new expenditure is 0.84X, which is 70% of the new income (since 0.84X / 1.2X = 0.7 or 70%). So the percentage remains the same. But the options don't have 70% as an option. The options are all lower than that, so maybe this isn't the correct approach.\n\nScenario 2: His absolute expenditure remains the same, but his income increases. So his new expenditure is 0.7X, and his new income is 1.2X. So the percentage is (0.7X / 1.2X) *100% = (0.7 / 1.2)*100% = approximately 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, why would his expenditure remain the same? The problem says his income increases. It doesn't say whether he adjusts his spending or not. So the initial assumption is that he continues to spend the same percentage of his income. But in that case, the percentage would remain 70%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question is assuming that his absolute expenditure doesn't change, and the percentage of income spent decreases.\n\nBut that depends on how the problem is worded. The question is: \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nHmm, I think I need to clarify the problem again. Let's read the question again.\n\nThe man spends 70% of his income. So his current spending is 70% of his current income. Now, his income increases by 20%. So his new income is 1.2 times the original. What is his new expenditure? So, the question is, what is the new percentage of his income that he spends.\n\nWait, but that would be the same 70%, because he spends 70% of the new income. So 70% of 1.2X is 0.84X. So as a percentage of his new income, that's 70%. But that's not an option either. The options are A)58.3%, B)62.5%, etc.\n\nWait, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income, not the new income.\n\nWait, that would make sense. Let me try that.\n\nOriginal income: X. He spends 0.7X.\n\nNew income: 1.2X. He spends 0.7 * 1.2X = 0.84X.\n\nSo, 0.84X is what percentage of the original income (X)? It's 84% of the original income. But none of the options are 84%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me read the options again. The options are all in the 50-65% range.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the man's expenditure is fixed, and his income increases. So his expenditure doesn't change, but the percentage of his income that he spends goes down.\n\nLet me try that. Suppose his original income is X, he spends 0.7X. Now, his income increases by 20% to 1.2X. If his expenditure remains the same (0.7X), then the percentage of his new income that he spends is (0.7X)/(1.2X) = 0.58333..., which is 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut why would his expenditure remain the same? The question doesn't state that. It just says his income increases. So perhaps that's the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that his income increases, but he continues to spend the same proportion. So his new expenditure is 70% of 1.2X, which is 0.84X. But then the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income, which would still be 70%, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 70%. So perhaps the question is about the absolute amount of his expenditure, not the percentage.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased: \"what will be his new expenditure?\" It could be referring to the percentage of his new income, but perhaps the question is actually asking about the absolute amount. But in that case, the answer would be 0.7 * 1.2X = 0.84X, which is 84% of his original income, but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me try to approach it another way. Let me assign a specific value to his original income to make calculations easier.\n\nLet me assume his original income is $100. So he spends 70% of it, which is $70.\n\nNow, his income increases by 20%, so new income is $120.\n\nIf he continues to spend 70% of his income, then he spends 70% of $120, which is $84. So his new expenditure is $84, which is 84% of his original income. But as a percentage of his new income, it's 70% again.\n\nBut the question is about his new expenditure. So if the question is asking what percentage of his new income he spends, the answer is 70%, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is asking what his new expenditure is as a percentage of his original income, then it's 84%, which again isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the expenditure as a percentage of his new income, but maybe the man's spending doesn't change. That is, he continues to spend $70, but his income is now $120. So $70 is what percentage of $120?\n\nLet me calculate that: (70 / 120) * 100 = (7/12)*100 \u224858.333...%, which is option A.\n\nSo the options are A)58.3%, which would be the case if his expenditure remains the same, but his income increases. But the question states that he spends 70% of his income. So if his income goes up, his expenditure should also go up proportionally, right?\n\nWait, but that would mean that the percentage remains the same. So why is the option 58.3% present?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, what will be his new expenditure?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe it's about his expenditure, not the percentage. So he used to spend 70% of his income, and now his income is 20% higher. So his new expenditure is 70% of the new income.\n\nWhich is 70% of 1.2X, which is 0.84X, which is 84% of the original income. But again, the options don't have 84%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's spending is a fixed amount, not a percentage. So he spends a fixed amount, say $70, regardless of income. But the question says he spends 70% of his income, which implies it's a percentage, not a fixed amount.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal income: X. Expenditure: 0.7X.\n\nIncome increases by 20%: 1.2X.\n\nIf he continues to spend 70% of his income, new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2X = 0.84X. So, as a percentage of the new income, it's 70%.\n\nBut the options don't have 70%. So perhaps the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income.\n\n0.84X / X = 84%, but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, but the options given are all lower than 70%, which suggests that the new expenditure percentage is lower. That only makes sense if his expenditure remains the same in absolute terms, not as a percentage.\n\nSo, if his income is 1.2X, but he continues to spend 0.7X (the same as before), then 0.7X is 70% of the original income, but as a percentage of the new income, it's 0.7X / 1.2X = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nSo the question must be implying that his absolute expenditure doesn't change, and only his income increases, thereby reducing the percentage of income he spends.\n\nBut the original problem says he spends 70% of his income. So, if his income increases, wouldn't he naturally spend a higher amount? So I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it with algebra.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nOriginal income: I\n\nOriginal expenditure: E = 0.7I.\n\nAfter income increases by 20%, new income I' = I + 0.2I = 1.2I.\n\nIf he continues to spend the same percentage, then new expenditure E' = 0.7 * I' = 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I.\n\nSo E' is 0.84I. Now, as a percentage of I', E' is (0.84I / 1.2I) * 100% = 70%. So the percentage remains the same.\n\nBut the options don't have 70%. So perhaps the question is phrased differently. It says \"what will be his new expenditure?\" which could mean the absolute amount, not the percentage.\n\nWait, but the options are percentages, so it's more likely that the question is asking for the percentage of income he spends, not the absolute amount.\n\nWait, but that would make the answer 70%, which isn't an option. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure doesn't increase with income. So he continues to spend the same absolute amount, 0.7I. Then, with new income I' = 1.2I, his new expenditure as a percentage is (0.7I / 1.2I) * 100% = (0.7/1.2)*100 \u224858.333%, which is option A.\n\nSo the answer would be A)58.3%.\n\nBut why would the problem imply that his spending remains the same? Because the initial statement says he spends 70% of his income. So, if income increases, spending would also increase to 70% of the new income, meaning the percentage remains the same. But that doesn't fit the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased as \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" And \"expenditure\" refers to the percentage of his income that he spends. So, in that case, if his income increases but his expenditure percentage remains the same, it's 70%. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the total expenditure, not as a percentage. But the options are percentages, so that's probably not it.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in my calculations. Let me re-calculate.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nOriginal expenditure: 70% of I = 0.7I.\n\nAfter 20% increase: new income I' = I * 1.2.\n\nIf he continues to spend 70%, new expenditure is 0.7 * I' = 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I.\n\nSo, 0.84I is his new expenditure, which is 84% of his original income. But as a percentage of his new income, it's (0.84I / 1.2I) *100% = 70%.\n\nSo the percentage is 70%, but that's not an option.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think of another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about his new expenditure as a percentage of his original income, not the new income. So, 0.84I is 84% of original income, but the options don't have that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the man's expenditure increasing by 20%, but that's not what the question says.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again.\n\n\"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the new amount he spends, not as a percentage but in absolute terms. But the options are percentages, so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a different percentage. Let me see.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't say anything about his expenditure increasing. It only says his income increases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the man's expenditure is fixed, so when his income goes up, the percentage of his income that he spends goes down.\n\nSo, original income: I.\n\nOriginal expenditure: 70% of I.\n\nAfter income increases by 20%, new income I' = 1.2I.\n\nExpenditure remains the same: 0.7I.\n\nSo, the new percentage is (0.7I) / (1.2I) = 0.7/1.2 = 0.583333..., which is 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nSo, the answer would be A)58.3%.\n\nBut why would the problem assume that his expenditure remains the same? Because in reality, if your income goes up, you might adjust your spending. But the problem doesn't state that; it just says he spends 70% of his income. So perhaps the intended interpretation is that he continues to spend 70% of his new income, but that doesn't align with the options.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased as 'spends 70% of his income' but the way it's written might be ambiguous. Let me think about whether it's 70% of his income, or whether it's that 70% is his expenditure, implying that 70% is the amount he spends, but that's not correct.\n\nWait, no, the problem states he spends 70% of his income, so it's 70% of his income that's spent. So, if his income increases, his expenditure also increases.\n\nBut then the new percentage is 70%, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 70%, so perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is that his income increases, but his expenditure is fixed, and the question is asking what percentage of his new income is that expenditure.\n\nSo, original income: X.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7X.\n\nNew income: 1.2X.\n\nExpenditure remains 0.7X.\n\nSo, new percentage: (0.7X / 1.2X) * 100% = (7/12)*100 \u224858.333%, which is option A.\n\nSo, the answer must be A)58.3%.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So, if his income increases, wouldn't he spend more, keeping the percentage the same?\n\nAh, perhaps the question is not about the percentage of income he spends, but about the actual amount he spends. But the options are percentages, which makes me think the question is about the percentage of income.\n\nWait, maybe the question is that his income increases, but he doesn't change his spending habits, so his expenditure as a percentage of income decreases.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be 58.3%, which is option A.\n\nI think that's the intended interpretation, even though it's a bit counterintuitive because the problem states he spends 70% of his income. But perhaps the wording is intended to be that his expenditure is a fixed amount, not a percentage.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is misworded, and it should say 'saves 70% of his income' but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that he has a fixed expenditure, so when his income increases, the percentage spent decreases.\n\nIn that case, the answer is 58.3%, option A.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the correct answer is option A)58.3%.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem states that a man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, the question asks for his new expenditure as a percentage of his income. To solve this, we analyze the situation under two interpretations:\n\n1. **Expenditure as a percentage of new income**:  \n   - Let the original income be \\( I \\).  \n   - He spends 70% of his income, so his original expenditure is \\( 0.7I \\).  \n   - After a 20% increase, the new income is \\( 1.2I \\).  \n   - If he continues to spend 70% of his income, his new expenditure is \\( 0.7 \\times 1.2I = 0.84I \\).  \n   - As a percentage of the new income, this is \\( \\frac{0.84I}{1.2I} \\times 100\\% = 70\\% \\).  \n   - However, 70% is not one of the answer options.\n\n2. **Expenditure as a fixed amount**:  \n   - If his expenditure remains the same in absolute terms (e.g., $0.7I$), and his income increases to \\( 1.2I \\), the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income is:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{0.7I}{1.2I} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{7}{12} \\times 100\\% \\approx 58.333\\%.\n   \\]  \n   - This matches option A.\n\nGiven the options provided, the intended interpretation appears to be that the man's expenditure remains constant in absolute terms, and the question asks for the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",

So as a percentage of his new income, that's 70%. But that's not an option either. The options are A)58.3%, B)62.5%, etc.\n\nWait, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

So his expenditure doesn't change, but the percentage of his income that he spends goes down.\n\nLet me try that. Suppose his original income is X, he spends 0.7X. Now, his income increases by 20% to 1.2X. If his expenditure remains the same (0.7X), then the percentage of his new income that he spends is (0.7X)/(1.2X) = 0.58333..., which is 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut why would his expenditure remain the same? The question doesn't state that. It just says his income increases. So perhaps that's the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that his income increases, but he continues to spend the same proportion. So his new expenditure is 70% of 1.2X, which is 0.84X. But then the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income, which would still be 70%, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 70%. So perhaps the question is about the absolute amount of his expenditure, not the percentage.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased: \"what will be his new expenditure?\" It could be referring to the percentage of his new income, but perhaps the question is actually asking about the absolute amount. But in that case, the answer would be 0.7 * 1.2X = 0.84X, which is 84% of his original income, but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me try to approach it another way. Let me assign a specific value to his original income to make calculations easier.\n\nLet me assume his original income is $100. So he spends 70% of it, which is $70.\n\nNow, his income increases by 20%, so new income is $120.\n\nIf he continues to spend 70% of his income, then he spends 70% of $120, which is $84. So his new expenditure is $84, which is 84% of his original income. But as a percentage of his new income, it's 70% again.\n\nBut the question is about his new expenditure. So if the question is asking what percentage of his new income he spends, the answer is 70%, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is asking what his new expenditure is as a percentage of his original income, then it's 84%, which again isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the expenditure as a percentage of his new income, but maybe the man's spending doesn't change. That is, he continues to spend $70, but his income is now $120. So $70 is what percentage of $120?\n\nLet me calculate that: (70 / 120) * 100 = (7/12)*100 \u224858.333...%, which is option A.\n\nSo the options are A)58.3%, which would be the case if his expenditure remains the same, but his income increases. But the question states that he spends 70% of his income. So if his income goes up, his expenditure should also go up proportionally, right?\n\nWait, but that would mean that the percentage remains the same. So why is the option 58.3% present?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, what will be his new expenditure?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe it's about his expenditure, not the percentage. So he used to spend 70% of his income, and now his income is 20% higher. So his new expenditure is 70% of the new income.\n\nWhich is 70% of 1.2X, which is 0.84X, which is 84% of the original income. But again, the options don't have 84%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's spending is a fixed amount, not a percentage. So he spends a fixed amount, say $70, regardless of income. But the question says he spends 70% of his income, which implies it's a percentage, not a fixed amount.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal income: X. Expenditure: 0.7X.\n\nIncome increases by 20%: 1.2X.\n\nIf he continues to spend 70% of his income, new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2X = 0.84X. So, as a percentage of the new income, it's 70%.\n\nBut the options don't have 70%. So perhaps the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income.\n\n0.84X / X = 84%, but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, but the options given are all lower than 70%, which suggests that the new expenditure percentage is lower. That only makes sense if his expenditure remains the same in absolute terms, not as a percentage.\n\nSo, if his income is 1.2X, but he continues to spend 0.7X (the same as before), then 0.7X is 70% of the original income, but as a percentage of the new income, it's 0.7X / 1.2X = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nSo the question must be implying that his absolute expenditure doesn't change, and only his income increases, thereby reducing the percentage of income he spends.\n\nBut the original problem says he spends 70% of his income. So, if his income increases, wouldn't he naturally spend a higher amount? So I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it with algebra.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nOriginal income: I\n\nOriginal expenditure: E = 0.7I.\n\nAfter income increases by 20%, new income I' = I + 0.2I = 1.2I.\n\nIf he continues to spend the same percentage, then new expenditure E' = 0.7 * I' = 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I.\n\nSo E' is 0.84I. Now, as a percentage of I', E' is (0.84I / 1.2I) * 100% = 70%. So the percentage remains the same.\n\nBut the options don't have 70%. So perhaps the question is phrased differently. It says \"what will be his new expenditure?\" which could mean the absolute amount, not the percentage.\n\nWait, but the options are percentages, so it's more likely that the question is asking for the percentage of income he spends, not the absolute amount.\n\nWait, but that would make the answer 70%, which isn't an option. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure doesn't increase with income. So he continues to spend the same absolute amount, 0.7I. Then, with new income I' = 1.2I, his new expenditure as a percentage is (0.7I / 1.2I) * 100% = (0.7/1.2)*100 \u224858.333%, which is option A.\n\nSo the answer would be A)58.3%.\n\nBut why would the problem imply that his spending remains the same? Because the initial statement says he spends 70% of his income. So, if income increases, spending would also increase to 70% of the new income, meaning the percentage remains the same. But that doesn't fit the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased as \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" And \"expenditure\" refers to the percentage of his income that he spends. So, in that case, if his income increases but his expenditure percentage remains the same, it's 70%. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the total expenditure, not as a percentage. But the options are percentages, so that's probably not it.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in my calculations. Let me re-calculate.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nOriginal expenditure: 70% of I = 0.7I.\n\nAfter 20% increase: new income I' = I * 1.2.\n\nIf he continues to spend 70%, new expenditure is 0.7 * I' = 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I.\n\nSo, 0.84I is his new expenditure, which is 84% of his original income. But as a percentage of his new income, it's (0.84I / 1.2I) *100% = 70%.\n\nSo the percentage is 70%, but that's not an option.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think of another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about his new expenditure as a percentage of his original income, not the new income. So, 0.84I is 84% of original income, but the options don't have that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the man's expenditure increasing by 20%, but that's not what the question says.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again.\n\n\"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the new amount he spends, not as a percentage but in absolute terms. But the options are percentages, so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that his income increases by 20%, but his expenditure increases by a different percentage. Let me see.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't say anything about his expenditure increasing. It only says his income increases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the man's expenditure is fixed, so when his income goes up, the percentage of his income that he spends goes down.\n\nSo, original income: I.\n\nOriginal expenditure: 70% of I.\n\nAfter income increases by 20%, new income I' = 1.2I.\n\nExpenditure remains the same: 0.7I.\n\nSo, the new percentage is (0.7I) / (1.2I) = 0.7/1.2 = 0.583333..., which is 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nSo, the answer would be A)58.3%.\n\nBut why would the problem assume that his expenditure remains the same? Because in reality, if your income goes up, you might adjust your spending. But the problem doesn't state that; it just says he spends 70% of his income. So perhaps the intended interpretation is that he continues to spend 70% of his new income, but that doesn't align with the options.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased as 'spends 70% of his income' but the way it's written might be ambiguous. Let me think about whether it's 70% of his income, or whether it's that 70% is his expenditure, implying that 70% is the amount he spends, but that's not correct.\n\nWait, no, the problem states he spends 70% of his income, so it's 70% of his income that's spent. So, if his income increases, his expenditure also increases.\n\nBut then the new percentage is 70%, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 70%, so perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is that his income increases, but his expenditure is fixed, and the question is asking what percentage of his new income is that expenditure.\n\nSo, original income: X.\n\nExpenditure: 0.7X.\n\nNew income: 1.2X.\n\nExpenditure remains 0.7X.\n\nSo, new percentage: (0.7X / 1.2X) * 100% = (7/12)*100 \u224858.333%, which is option A.\n\nSo, the answer must be A)58.3%.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the problem says he spends 70% of his income. So, if his income increases, wouldn't he spend more, keeping the percentage the same?\n\nAh, perhaps the question is not about the percentage of income he spends, but about the actual amount he spends. But the options are percentages, which makes me think the question is about the percentage of income.\n\nWait, maybe the question is that his income increases, but he doesn't change his spending habits, so his expenditure as a percentage of income decreases.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be 58.3%, which is option A.\n\nI think that's the intended interpretation, even though it's a bit counterintuitive because the problem states he spends 70% of his income. But perhaps the wording is intended to be that his expenditure is a fixed amount, not a percentage.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is misworded, and it should say 'saves 70% of his income' but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that he has a fixed expenditure, so when his income increases, the percentage spent decreases.\n\nIn that case, the answer is 58.3%, option A.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the correct answer is option A)58.3%.\n\n\nThe problem states that a man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, the question asks for his new expenditure as a percentage of his income. To solve this, we analyze the situation under two interpretations:\n\n1. **Expenditure as a percentage of new income**:  \n   - Let the original income be \\( I \\).  \n   - He spends 70% of his income, so his original expenditure is \\( 0.7I \\).  \n   - After a 20% increase, the new income is \\( 1.2I \\).  \n   - If he continues to spend 70% of his income, his new expenditure is \\( 0.7 \\times 1.2I = 0.84I \\).  \n   - As a percentage of the new income, this is \\( \\frac{0.84I}{1.2I} \\times 100\\% = 70\\% \\).  \n   - However, 70% is not one of the answer options.\n\n2. **Expenditure as a fixed amount**:  \n   - If his expenditure remains the same in absolute terms (e.g., $0.7I$), and his income increases to \\( 1.2I \\), the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income is:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{0.7I}{1.2I} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{7}{12} \\times 100\\% \\approx 58.333\\%.\n   \\]  \n   - This matches option A.\n\nGiven the options provided, the intended interpretation appears to be that the man's expenditure remains constant in absolute terms, and the question asks for the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says a man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, what will be his new expenditure? The options are A to E, with percentages listed.\n\nHmm, I think I need to break this down. Let me start by understanding what's given. The man's current spending is 70% of his income. So, if his income is, say, $100, he's spending $70. But wait, maybe I should approach this with variables instead of actual numbers to keep it general.\n\nLet's denote his original income as I. So, he spends 70% of I, which is 0.7 * I. His savings would then be 30% of I, which is 0.3 * I. Now, the problem says his income increases by 20%. So, his new income is I plus 20% of I. That's I * (1 + 0.20) = 1.2 * I.\n\nWait, but the question is about his new expenditure. Does his spending increase by the same percentage, or does he adjust his spending based on the new income? I think the assumption is that his spending pattern remains the same percentage of his new income. So, if he was spending 70% before, perhaps he continues to spend 70% after the income increase.\n\nWait, no, that might not be the case. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe his expenditure is a fixed amount, and the percentage changes because his income has changed. Hmm, no, I think the question implies that his spending as a percentage of income is fixed unless told otherwise. So, if his income increases by 20%, his spending would be 70% of the new income.\n\nWait, but that would make the new expenditure 0.7 * 1.2 * I = 0.84 * I. So, the new expenditure as a percentage of his new income is still 70%? Wait, no, because 0.84 I is 70% of 1.2 I. Because 1.2 I * 0.7 = 0.84 I.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if his income goes up by 20%, and he's spending the same percentage, his absolute spending goes up. But the question is asking about his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income, or perhaps it's just the absolute amount, but the options are percentages, so probably it's a percentage of the new income.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait a second. Let me clarify the question. It says, \"what will be his new expenditure?\" The options are percentages, so I think it's asking for the percentage of his income that he spends, not the absolute amount.\n\nSo, if his income increases by 20%, and he continues to spend 70% of it, then his new expenditure is 70% of the new income. But that doesn't change the percentage; it's still 70%, which isn't one of the options. Wait, the options are all different.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe his expenditure is a fixed amount, and when his income increases, the percentage of his income that he spends changes. For example, if he was spending 70% of $100 (so $70), and then his income goes up by 20% to $120, he continues to spend $70. So, his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income is 70 / 120 = 0.583333..., which is 58.333...%, which is option A: 58.3%.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the man's spending is a fixed amount, not a percentage of income. Oh, wait, the question says he \"spends 70% of his income.\" So, that suggests that his spending is 70% of his income. So, when his income increases, his spending also increases by 70% of the new income. So, if his income goes up by 20%, his spending also goes up by 70% of the new income. So, in that case, his new spending is 70% of 1.2 I, which is 0.84 I.\n\nBut then the question is, what is the new expenditure? So, if the question is about his spending as a percentage of his new income, it's still 70%, which isn't one of the options. But the options are all lower than 70%, which suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking about his savings as a percentage of income, but no, the question clearly states \"expenditure.\" Alternatively, perhaps his expenditure is a fixed amount, not a percentage, so when his income increases, the percentage of income he spends decreases.\n\nWait, let's model both scenarios.\n\nScenario 1: Spending is a fixed percentage of income (70%). So, if income increases by 20%, spending increases to 70% of the new income. So, new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I. The percentage of income spent remains 70%, so that's not the case here.\n\nScenario 2: Spending is a fixed amount. So, he spends, say, $70 regardless of income. If income increases to $120, then the percentage spent is 70/120 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut the original question says he \"spends 70% of his income.\" That implies that the spending is a percentage of income, not a fixed amount. So, if his income increases, his spending also increases by the same percentage. So, the percentage of income he spends remains 70%, so the new expenditure as a percentage is still 70%.\n\nBut that's not an option. Wait, the options don't have 70%. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about his expenditure increasing by 20%, but that's not what the question says. The question says his income increases by 20%.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about what percentage his expenditure is of his new income. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it with actual numbers. Let me assume his original income is $100. He spends 70%, so $70. His income increases by 20%, so new income is $120. Now, if his spending is 70% of new income, then he spends 70% of 120, which is 84. So, 84 is what he spends. But the question is, what is the new expenditure? So, the options are percentages, so perhaps the question is asking what percentage of his new income is his expenditure? In that case, it's 70%, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, but that's not making sense because the options are lower. So, perhaps the question is not about the percentage of income, but about the absolute percentage change. Wait, no, the options are percentages, not absolute amounts.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is, what's his new expenditure as a percentage of his original income. So, original income is 100, new income is 120. He spends 70% of 120, which is 84. So, 84 is 84% of the original income. But that's not an option either.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his spending doesn't change, but his income increases, so the percentage of his income that he spends decreases. So, he was spending 70% of his original income, which is $70 if original income is $100. Now, his income increases to $120, and he continues to spend $70. So, the new percentage is 70 / 120 = 0.583333..., which is 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut the problem states that he spends 70% of his income. So, if his income changes, his spending would change accordingly. So, if his income increases by 20%, his spending should also increase by 20% in the same terms. Wait, no. Let me model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is between absolute and relative changes. Let me think: Original spending is S = 0.7 I. If his income increases by 20%, new income is I_new = 1.2 I. If his spending increases by the same percentage, then S_new = 1.2 * S = 1.2 * 0.7 I = 0.84 I. Then, the new percentage of income spent is (0.84 I) / (1.2 I) = 0.7, which is 70%. But again, this isn't matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his spending doesn't increase with income. So, he continues to spend the same absolute amount, so S = 0.7 I remains the same. But then his income increases, so the percentage of income spent is S / I_new = 0.7 I / 1.2 I = 0.7 / 1.2 = 0.583333... = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut the question says he spends 70% of his income, so that would imply that when income increases, his spending should increase as a percentage. But according to the options, that's not the case. So, perhaps I'm missing something in the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by a certain amount, but the options are about what the new percentage is. Wait, no, the question says, \"what will be his new expenditure?\" So, perhaps the new expenditure is 70% of his new income, which would be 70% of 1.2 I, which is 0.84 I. But the options are percentages, so perhaps it's 0.84 I as a percentage of the original income, which would be 84%, but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Let's consider that the man's expenditure is 70% of his income. So, his savings are 30% of his income.\n\nIf his income increases by 20%, then his new income is 120% of the original. If his spending pattern remains the same (spending 70% of income), then his new expenditure is 70% of 120% of his original income.\n\nSo, 70% of 120% is 0.7 * 1.2 = 0.84, which is 84% of the original income. So, his new expenditure is 84% of his original income. But the options are percentages of the new income, perhaps.\n\nWait, no, the options are about his new expenditure as a percentage of his income. So, if his income is 120, and he spends 70% of that, which is 84. So, 84 is 70% of 120. So, 70% is the new percentage, but that's not an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of it differently. The problem is asking for the new expenditure, which would be 70% of the new income. So, if the new income is 1.2 times the original, the new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I. So, as a percentage of the new income, it's still 70%, but that's not an option. So, perhaps the question is phrased differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the percentage of the new income, but about the absolute change in spending. Let me see. If the original income is I, spending is 0.7 I. New income is 1.2 I. New spending is 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I. So, the increase in spending is 0.14 I. But the options are percentages, so perhaps the question is asking what percentage of his original income is his new spending.\n\nIn that case, 0.84 I is 84% of the original income. But again, that's not an option. So, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the percentage increase in his expenditure. Let me compute that. Original expenditure is 0.7 I. New is 0.84 I. The increase is 0.14 I, which is a 20% increase (since 0.14 I / 0.7 I = 0.2). So, the expenditure increases by 20%, but the question isn't about that; it's about the new expenditure as a percentage.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure doesn't increase proportionally. Maybe his expenditure remains the same, but his income increases, so the percentage of income spent decreases. Let me model this.\n\nIf his income goes up by 20%, but his spending remains 70 (assuming original income was 100, so spending was 70), then new income is 120. So, the new percentage is 70/120 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, the question says he spends 70% of his income, which suggests that his spending is 70% of his current income. So, if income increases, spending should also increase. So, why would the percentage decrease? That would only happen if his spending doesn't increase with his income.\n\nSo, perhaps the confusion is about whether the spending is a fixed percentage or a fixed amount. The question says he spends 70% of his income, which implies it's a percentage, so it should adjust with income.\n\nWait, but if the question is asking what percentage of his new income is his new expenditure, it's 70%, which is not an option. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nAh, wait! Maybe the question is not about the percentage of the new income, but about the actual amount he spends as a percentage of the original income. So, for example, if his income was $100, he spends $70. Then his income increases to $120, and he continues to spend 70% of his income, which is $84. So, $84 is 84% of the original income. But the options don't have 84%.\n\nWait, but the options are all lower than 70%, which suggests that perhaps the man's expenditure as a percentage of his income decreases when his income increases. Which would only happen if his expenditure is a fixed amount, not a percentage.\n\nWait, but the question says he spends 70% of his income. So, perhaps the confusion is that when his income increases, his spending as a percentage of his new income remains the same. So, the percentage doesn't change. But that's not the case, because the options don't have 70%.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me try another approach.\n\nSuppose the man's income is I. He spends 70% of I, so 0.7 I. His income increases by 20%, so new income is I + 0.2 I = 1.2 I.\n\nIf his spending pattern remains the same (70% of income), then new spending is 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I.\n\nThe question is, what is the new expenditure? So, if the question is about the absolute amount, then it's 0.84 I, which is 84% of the original income. But the options are percentages, so perhaps the question is asking for the new percentage of the original income. But that would be 84%, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking, what's the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income? In that case, it's 0.7, which is 70%, which again isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the question is phrased as, what's the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income. So, 0.84 I is 84% of the original income. But that's not an option either.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me try another approach. Maybe the question is about the percentage increase in his expenditure, but the options don't match that either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the percentage of his income that remains after spending, i.e., his savings. Let me see. If he spends 70%, he saves 30%. If his income increases by 20%, his savings would be 30% of 1.2 I, which is 0.36 I. So, his savings as a percentage of new income is 30% / 1.2 = 25%. So, his expenditure would be 75% of his new income. But that's not matching the options.\n\nWait, but that's not the question. The question is about expenditure, not savings.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options given. The options are A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%.\n\nThese are all lower than 70%, which suggests that the percentage of income he spends decreases. So, perhaps the scenario is that his expenditure is a fixed amount, not a percentage. So, when his income increases, the percentage of income spent decreases.\n\nLet me model that. Suppose his income was $100, he spends $70. If his income increases by 20% to $120, he still spends $70. So, the new percentage is 70/120 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut the question says he spends 70% of his income, which suggests that when his income increases, he spends 70% of the new income. So, perhaps the correct approach is that his spending as a percentage of his income remains the same, which would mean the percentage doesn't change, but the options don't have 70%.\n\nWait, but that's impossible because the options are all lower. So, perhaps the question is not about the percentage of income he spends, but about the absolute amount he spends as a percentage of his original income.\n\nWait, if his income increases by 20%, his new income is 1.2 I. If he continues to spend 70% of his new income, that's 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I. So, 0.84 I is 84% of his original income. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is that the man's expenditure is not a fixed percentage, but he has some fixed expenses, so when his income increases, his spending as a percentage of income decreases. But the question states he spends 70% of his income, so that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is a trick question, and the answer is 70%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a calculation error.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me denote:\n\nLet original income = I.\n\nOriginal expenditure = 0.7 I.\n\nIncome increases by 20%: new income = I + 0.2 I = 1.2 I.\n\nAssuming that his expenditure is a fixed proportion of income, new expenditure = 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I.\n\nSo, the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income is (0.84 I / I) * 100% = 84%, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income is (0.84 I / 1.2 I) * 100% = 70%, which again isn't an option.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the increase in his expenditure as a percentage of his new income. So, the increase is 0.84 I - 0.7 I = 0.14 I. So, 0.14 I / 1.2 I = 0.116666..., which is 11.666...%, but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of his original expenditure relative to his new income. So, original expenditure was 0.7 I. New income is 1.2 I. So, 0.7 I / 1.2 I = 0.583333..., which is 58.333...%, option A.\n\nBut that would imply that his spending doesn't change with income, which contradicts the question's statement that he spends 70% of his income. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that his spending remains fixed, and the percentage changes.\n\nBut according to the question, he spends 70% of his income, which suggests that when income increases, spending increases. So, I'm really confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, and the intended answer is option A, 58.3%. But that would only be the case if his spending remains fixed, which contradicts the given information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the percentage of his income that remains after spending. Wait, that's savings, not expenditure. So, original savings are 30% of I. If income increases by 20%, his savings as a percentage of new income would be (0.3 I) / (1.2 I) = 0.25, or 25%. So, his expenditure would be 75% of new income, which is 75%, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, but that's savings. The question is about expenditure, so that's not relevant.\n\nI'm stuck. Let me try to think of this as a proportion problem. Let me denote the original income as 100 units for simplicity. So, original income I = 100, expenditure E = 70.\n\nIncome increases by 20%: new income I' = 120.\n\nIf he continues to spend 70% of his income, new expenditure E' = 70% of 120 = 84. So, E' =84.\n\nNow, the question is, what is the new expenditure? The options are percentages, so perhaps the question is, what is E' as a percentage of the original income? That would be 84/100 = 84%, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, the question might be asking, what is the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income? That's 70%, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking, what is the percentage increase in his expenditure? Original E=70, new E=84. Increase is 14. So, percentage increase is (14/70)*100 =20%. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is, what is the new expenditure as a percentage of his original expenditure? So, 84 is 84/70 = 1.2, which is 120%. Not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about his total expenditure as a percentage of his original income, but that's 84, which is 84% of the original income, not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm clearly missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the percentage of his income that is left after spending. No, that's savings, which we calculated as 25%, not an option.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the man's expenditure increases by the same absolute amount as his income. So, income increases by 20%, which is 20 units (if original income was 100), so expenditure increases by 20, making it 90. So, 90 is 90% of the original income, but that's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the man's expenditure increases by 20% of his original expenditure. So, original expenditure was 70, increase is 14, new expenditure is 84, which is 84% of the original income. Not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me consider the options given. The options are all below 70%, which suggests that the percentage of income spent is decreasing. So, the only way that happens is if his expenditure doesn't increase as much as his income.\n\nSo, the only way that would happen is if his expenditure is fixed, not a percentage. So, let's model that.\n\nOriginal income I, expenditure E = 0.7 I.\n\nIncome increases to 1.2 I.\n\nIf E remains the same (0.7 I), then the new percentage is (0.7 I) / (1.2 I) = 0.7 / 1.2 = 0.583333..., which is 58.333...%, option A.\n\nBut the question says he spends 70% of his income. So, that can't be the case unless the question is phrased incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick, and the answer is 70%, but that's not an option. Or perhaps I've made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about his expenditure as a percentage of his new income, which is 70%, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the percentage of his original income that he spends after the increase, which would be 0.7 * 1.2 I / I = 0.84, which is 84%, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the percentage increase in his expenditure. So, 70 to 84 is an increase of 14, which is 20% increase. But that's not an option either.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the only scenario where the percentage of income spent decreases, which would be option A, 58.3%, assuming his expenditure is fixed. But according to the question, his expenditure is a percentage of income, so that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the question one more time. The question says, \"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking, after his income increases, what's the new percentage of his income that he spends. So, he was spending 70% of I, now he spends 70% of 1.2 I, which is 84% of the original income. So, the new expenditure is 84% of original income. But the options are all lower than 70%, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but 84% of original income is higher than 70%, so that's not an option either.\n\nI'm really confused. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let me try to think of it in terms of fractions.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nExpenditure: (70/100) I = 0.7 I.\n\nIncome increases by 20%: new income = I * (120/100) = 1.2 I.\n\nNew expenditure: 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I.\n\nSo, new expenditure is 0.84 I.\n\nNow, the question is, what is his new expenditure? The options are percentages, so perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of his original income that is his new expenditure. So, 0.84 I is 84% of the original income. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of his new income that is his new expenditure. That would be 0.84 I / 1.2 I = 0.7, which is 70%, not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm not seeing any other approach. Given the options, the only possible answer that makes sense is option A, 58.3%, which would be the case if his expenditure remains fixed. But according to the question, that's not the case. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a man who spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, the question asks for his new expenditure as a percentage of his income. The options provided are A) 58.3%, B) 62.5%, C) 63.5%, D) 64.5%, and E) 65.5%.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Original Income and Expenditure**:  \n   Let the original income be denoted as \\( I \\). The man spends 70% of his income, so his original expenditure is \\( 0.7I \\).\n\n2. **New Income**:  \n   If his income increases by 20%, the new income becomes:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{New Income} = I + 0.2I = 1.2I\n   \\]\n\n3. **New Expenditure**:  \n   If the man continues to spend 70% of his income, his new expenditure would be:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{New Expenditure} = 0.7 \\times \\text{New Income} = 0.7 \\times 1.2I = 0.84I\n   \\]\n\n4. **Interpretation of the Question**:  \n   The question asks for the new expenditure as a percentage of the **new income**. Since the new income is \\( 1.2I \\), the percentage of income spent is:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{New Expenditure}}{\\text{New Income}} \\times 100 = \\frac{0.84I}{1.2I} \\times 100 = 70\\%\n   \\]  \n   However, 70% is not one of the options.\n\n5. **Alternative Interpretation**:  \n   If the man's expenditure remains fixed at \\( 0.7I \\) (i.e., he does not adjust his spending with the income increase), then the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income would be:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{Expenditure}}{\\text{New Income}} \\times 100 = \\frac{0.7I}{1.2I} \\times 100 = 58.3\\%\n   \\]  \n   This matches option A.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:  \n   While the question implies that the man spends 70% of his income, the options suggest that his expenditure is treated as a fixed amount rather than a percentage. Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that his expenditure remains fixed, and the new percentage of income spent is **58.3%**.\n\nANSWER: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says a man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, what will be his new expenditure? The options are A to E, with percentages listed.\n\nHmm, I think I need to break this down. Let me start by understanding what's given. The man's current spending is 70% of his income. So, if his income is, say, $100, he's spending $70. But wait, maybe I should approach this with variables instead of actual numbers to keep it general.\n\nLet's denote his original income as I. So, he spends 70% of I, which is 0.7 * I. His savings would then be 30% of I, which is 0.3 * I. Now, the problem says his income increases by 20%. So, his new income is I plus 20% of I. That's I * (1 + 0.20) = 1.2 * I.\n\nWait, but the question is about his new expenditure. Does his spending increase by the same percentage, or does he adjust his spending based on the new income? I think the assumption is that his spending pattern remains the same percentage of his new income. So, if he was spending 70% before, perhaps he continues to spend 70% after the income increase.\n\nWait, no, that might not be the case. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe his expenditure is a fixed amount, and the percentage changes because his income has changed. Hmm, no, I think the question implies that his spending as a percentage of income is fixed unless told otherwise. So, if his income increases by 20%, his spending would be 70% of the new income.\n\nWait, but that would make the new expenditure 0.7 * 1.2 * I = 0.84 * I. So, the new expenditure as a percentage of his new income is still 70%? Wait, no, because 0.84 I is 70% of 1.2 I. Because 1.2 I * 0.7 = 0.84 I.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if his income goes up by 20%, and he's spending the same percentage, his absolute spending goes up. But the question is asking about his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income, or perhaps it's just the absolute amount, but the options are percentages, so probably it's a percentage of the new income.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait a second. Let me clarify the question. It says, \"what will be his new expenditure?\" The options are percentages, so I think it's asking for the percentage of his income that he spends, not the absolute amount.\n\nSo, if his income increases by 20%, and he continues to spend 70% of it, then his new expenditure is 70% of the new income. But that doesn't change the percentage; it's still 70%, which isn't one of the options. Wait, the options are all different.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe his expenditure is a fixed amount, and when his income increases, the percentage of his income that he spends changes. For example, if he was spending 70% of $100 (so $70), and then his income goes up by 20% to $120, he continues to spend $70. So, his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income is 70 / 120 = 0.583333..., which is 58.333...%, which is option A: 58.3%.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the man's spending is a fixed amount, not a percentage of income. Oh, wait, the question says he \"spends 70% of his income.\" So, that suggests that his spending is 70% of his income. So, when his income increases, his spending also increases by 70% of the new income. So, if his income goes up by 20%, his spending also goes up by 70% of the new income. So, in that case, his new spending is 70% of 1.2 I, which is 0.84 I.\n\nBut then the question is, what is the new expenditure? So, if the question is about his spending as a percentage of his new income, it's still 70%, which isn't one of the options. But the options are all lower than 70%, which suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking about his savings as a percentage of income, but no, the question clearly states \"expenditure.\" Alternatively, perhaps his expenditure is a fixed amount, not a percentage, so when his income increases, the percentage of income he spends decreases.\n\nWait, let's model both scenarios.\n\nScenario 1: Spending is a fixed percentage of income (70%). So, if income increases by 20%, spending increases to 70% of the new income. So, new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I. The percentage of income spent remains 70%, so that's not the case here.\n\nScenario 2: Spending is a fixed amount. So, he spends, say, $70 regardless of income. If income increases to $120, then the percentage spent is 70/120 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut the original question says he \"spends 70% of his income.\" That implies that the spending is a percentage of income, not a fixed amount. So, if his income increases, his spending also increases by the same percentage. So, the percentage of income he spends remains 70%, so the new expenditure as a percentage is still 70%.\n\nBut that's not an option. Wait, the options don't have 70%. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about his expenditure increasing by 20%, but that's not what the question says. The question says his income increases by 20%.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about what percentage his expenditure is of his new income. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it with actual numbers. Let me assume his original income is $100. He spends 70%, so $70. His income increases by 20%, so new income is $120. Now, if his spending is 70% of new income, then he spends 70% of 120, which is 84. So, 84 is what he spends. But the question is, what is the new expenditure? So, the options are percentages, so perhaps the question is asking what percentage of his new income is his expenditure? In that case, it's 70%, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, but that's not making sense because the options are lower. So, perhaps the question is not about the percentage of income, but about the absolute percentage change. Wait, no, the options are percentages, not absolute amounts.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is, what's his new expenditure as a percentage of his original income. So, original income is 100, new income is 120. He spends 70% of 120, which is 84. So, 84 is 84% of the original income. But that's not an option either.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his spending doesn't change, but his income increases, so the percentage of his income that he spends decreases. So, he was spending 70% of his original income, which is $70 if original income is $100. Now, his income increases to $120, and he continues to spend $70. So, the new percentage is 70 / 120 = 0.583333..., which is 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut the problem states that he spends 70% of his income. So, if his income changes, his spending would change accordingly. So, if his income increases by 20%, his spending should also increase by 20% in the same terms. Wait, no. Let me model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is between absolute and relative changes. Let me think: Original spending is S = 0.7 I. If his income increases by 20%, new income is I_new = 1.2 I. If his spending increases by the same percentage, then S_new = 1.2 * S = 1.2 * 0.7 I = 0.84 I. Then, the new percentage of income spent is (0.84 I) / (1.2 I) = 0.7, which is 70%. But again, this isn't matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that his spending doesn't increase with income. So, he continues to spend the same absolute amount, so S = 0.7 I remains the same. But then his income increases, so the percentage of income spent is S / I_new = 0.7 I / 1.2 I = 0.7 / 1.2 = 0.583333... = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut the question says he spends 70% of his income, so that would imply that when income increases, his spending should increase as a percentage. But according to the options, that's not the case. So, perhaps I'm missing something in the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that his income increases by 20%, and his expenditure increases by a certain amount, but the options are about what the new percentage is. Wait, no, the question says, \"what will be his new expenditure?\" So, perhaps the new expenditure is 70% of his new income, which would be 70% of 1.2 I, which is 0.84 I. But the options are percentages, so perhaps it's 0.84 I as a percentage of the original income, which would be 84%, but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Let's consider that the man's expenditure is 70% of his income. So, his savings are 30% of his income.\n\nIf his income increases by 20%, then his new income is 120% of the original. If his spending pattern remains the same (spending 70% of income), then his new expenditure is 70% of 120% of his original income.\n\nSo, 70% of 120% is 0.7 * 1.2 = 0.84, which is 84% of the original income. So, his new expenditure is 84% of his original income. But the options are percentages of the new income, perhaps.\n\nWait, no, the options are about his new expenditure as a percentage of his income. So, if his income is 120, and he spends 70% of that, which is 84. So, 84 is 70% of 120. So, 70% is the new percentage, but that's not an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of it differently. The problem is asking for the new expenditure, which would be 70% of the new income. So, if the new income is 1.2 times the original, the new expenditure is 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I. So, as a percentage of the new income, it's still 70%, but that's not an option. So, perhaps the question is phrased differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the percentage of the new income, but about the absolute change in spending. Let me see. If the original income is I, spending is 0.7 I. New income is 1.2 I. New spending is 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I. So, the increase in spending is 0.14 I. But the options are percentages, so perhaps the question is asking what percentage of his original income is his new spending.\n\nIn that case, 0.84 I is 84% of the original income. But again, that's not an option. So, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the percentage increase in his expenditure. Let me compute that. Original expenditure is 0.7 I. New is 0.84 I. The increase is 0.14 I, which is a 20% increase (since 0.14 I / 0.7 I = 0.2). So, the expenditure increases by 20%, but the question isn't about that; it's about the new expenditure as a percentage.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure doesn't increase proportionally. Maybe his expenditure remains the same, but his income increases, so the percentage of income spent decreases. Let me model this.\n\nIf his income goes up by 20%, but his spending remains 70 (assuming original income was 100, so spending was 70), then new income is 120. So, the new percentage is 70/120 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, the question says he spends 70% of his income, which suggests that his spending is 70% of his current income. So, if income increases, spending should also increase. So, why would the percentage decrease? That would only happen if his spending doesn't increase with his income.\n\nSo, perhaps the confusion is about whether the spending is a fixed percentage or a fixed amount. The question says he spends 70% of his income, which implies it's a percentage, so it should adjust with income.\n\nWait, but if the question is asking what percentage of his new income is his new expenditure, it's 70%, which is not an option. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nAh, wait! Maybe the question is not about the percentage of the new income, but about the actual amount he spends as a percentage of the original income. So, for example, if his income was $100, he spends $70. Then his income increases to $120, and he continues to spend 70% of his income, which is $84. So, $84 is 84% of the original income. But the options don't have 84%.\n\nWait, but the options are all lower than 70%, which suggests that perhaps the man's expenditure as a percentage of his income decreases when his income increases. Which would only happen if his expenditure is a fixed amount, not a percentage.\n\nWait, but the question says he spends 70% of his income. So, perhaps the confusion is that when his income increases, his spending as a percentage of his new income remains the same. So, the percentage doesn't change. But that's not the case, because the options don't have 70%.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me try another approach.\n\nSuppose the man's income is I. He spends 70% of I, so 0.7 I. His income increases by 20%, so new income is I + 0.2 I = 1.2 I.\n\nIf his spending pattern remains the same (70% of income), then new spending is 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I.\n\nThe question is, what is the new expenditure? So, if the question is about the absolute amount, then it's 0.84 I, which is 84% of the original income. But the options are percentages, so perhaps the question is asking for the new percentage of the original income. But that would be 84%, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking, what's the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income? In that case, it's 0.7, which is 70%, which again isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the question is phrased as, what's the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income. So, 0.84 I is 84% of the original income. But that's not an option either.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me try another approach. Maybe the question is about the percentage increase in his expenditure, but the options don't match that either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the percentage of his income that remains after spending, i.e., his savings. Let me see. If he spends 70%, he saves 30%. If his income increases by 20%, his savings would be 30% of 1.2 I, which is 0.36 I. So, his savings as a percentage of new income is 30% / 1.2 = 25%. So, his expenditure would be 75% of his new income. But that's not matching the options.\n\nWait, but that's not the question. The question is about expenditure, not savings.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options given. The options are A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%.\n\nThese are all lower than 70%, which suggests that the percentage of income he spends decreases. So, perhaps the scenario is that his expenditure is a fixed amount, not a percentage. So, when his income increases, the percentage of income spent decreases.\n\nLet me model that. Suppose his income was $100, he spends $70. If his income increases by 20% to $120, he still spends $70. So, the new percentage is 70/120 = 58.333...%, which is option A.\n\nBut the question says he spends 70% of his income, which suggests that when his income increases, he spends 70% of the new income. So, perhaps the correct approach is that his spending as a percentage of his income remains the same, which would mean the percentage doesn't change, but the options don't have 70%.\n\nWait, but that's impossible because the options are all lower. So, perhaps the question is not about the percentage of income he spends, but about the absolute amount he spends as a percentage of his original income.\n\nWait, if his income increases by 20%, his new income is 1.2 I. If he continues to spend 70% of his new income, that's 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I. So, 0.84 I is 84% of his original income. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is that the man's expenditure is not a fixed percentage, but he has some fixed expenses, so when his income increases, his spending as a percentage of income decreases. But the question states he spends 70% of his income, so that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is a trick question, and the answer is 70%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a calculation error.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me denote:\n\nLet original income = I.\n\nOriginal expenditure = 0.7 I.\n\nIncome increases by 20%: new income = I + 0.2 I = 1.2 I.\n\nAssuming that his expenditure is a fixed proportion of income, new expenditure = 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I.\n\nSo, the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income is (0.84 I / I) * 100% = 84%, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income is (0.84 I / 1.2 I) * 100% = 70%, which again isn't an option.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the increase in his expenditure as a percentage of his new income. So, the increase is 0.84 I - 0.7 I = 0.14 I. So, 0.14 I / 1.2 I = 0.116666..., which is 11.666...%, but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of his original expenditure relative to his new income. So, original expenditure was 0.7 I. New income is 1.2 I. So, 0.7 I / 1.2 I = 0.583333..., which is 58.333...%, option A.\n\nBut that would imply that his spending doesn't change with income, which contradicts the question's statement that he spends 70% of his income. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that his spending remains fixed, and the percentage changes.\n\nBut according to the question, he spends 70% of his income, which suggests that when income increases, spending increases. So, I'm really confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, and the intended answer is option A, 58.3%. But that would only be the case if his spending remains fixed, which contradicts the given information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the percentage of his income that remains after spending. Wait, that's savings, not expenditure. So, original savings are 30% of I. If income increases by 20%, his savings as a percentage of new income would be (0.3 I) / (1.2 I) = 0.25, or 25%. So, his expenditure would be 75% of new income, which is 75%, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, but that's savings. The question is about expenditure, so that's not relevant.\n\nI'm stuck. Let me try to think of this as a proportion problem. Let me denote the original income as 100 units for simplicity. So, original income I = 100, expenditure E = 70.\n\nIncome increases by 20%: new income I' = 120.\n\nIf he continues to spend 70% of his income, new expenditure E' = 70% of 120 = 84. So, E' =84.\n\nNow, the question is, what is the new expenditure? The options are percentages, so perhaps the question is, what is E' as a percentage of the original income? That would be 84/100 = 84%, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, the question might be asking, what is the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income? That's 70%, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking, what is the percentage increase in his expenditure? Original E=70, new E=84. Increase is 14. So, percentage increase is (14/70)*100 =20%. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is, what is the new expenditure as a percentage of his original expenditure? So, 84 is 84/70 = 1.2, which is 120%. Not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about his total expenditure as a percentage of his original income, but that's 84, which is 84% of the original income, not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm clearly missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the percentage of his income that is left after spending. No, that's savings, which we calculated as 25%, not an option.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the man's expenditure increases by the same absolute amount as his income. So, income increases by 20%, which is 20 units (if original income was 100), so expenditure increases by 20, making it 90. So, 90 is 90% of the original income, but that's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the man's expenditure increases by 20% of his original expenditure. So, original expenditure was 70, increase is 14, new expenditure is 84, which is 84% of the original income. Not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me consider the options given. The options are all below 70%, which suggests that the percentage of income spent is decreasing. So, the only way that happens is if his expenditure doesn't increase as much as his income.\n\nSo, the only way that would happen is if his expenditure is fixed, not a percentage. So, let's model that.\n\nOriginal income I, expenditure E = 0.7 I.\n\nIncome increases to 1.2 I.\n\nIf E remains the same (0.7 I), then the new percentage is (0.7 I) / (1.2 I) = 0.7 / 1.2 = 0.583333..., which is 58.333...%, option A.\n\nBut the question says he spends 70% of his income. So, that can't be the case unless the question is phrased incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick, and the answer is 70%, but that's not an option. Or perhaps I've made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about his expenditure as a percentage of his new income, which is 70%, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the percentage of his original income that he spends after the increase, which would be 0.7 * 1.2 I / I = 0.84, which is 84%, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the percentage increase in his expenditure. So, 70 to 84 is an increase of 14, which is 20% increase. But that's not an option either.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the only scenario where the percentage of income spent decreases, which would be option A, 58.3%, assuming his expenditure is fixed. But according to the question, his expenditure is a percentage of income, so that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the question one more time. The question says, \"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking, after his income increases, what's the new percentage of his income that he spends. So, he was spending 70% of I, now he spends 70% of 1.2 I, which is 84% of the original income. So, the new expenditure is 84% of original income. But the options are all lower than 70%, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but 84% of original income is higher than 70%, so that's not an option either.\n\nI'm really confused. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let me try to think of it in terms of fractions.\n\nOriginal income: I.\n\nExpenditure: (70/100) I = 0.7 I.\n\nIncome increases by 20%: new income = I * (120/100) = 1.2 I.\n\nNew expenditure: 0.7 * 1.2 I = 0.84 I.\n\nSo, new expenditure is 0.84 I.\n\nNow, the question is, what is his new expenditure? The options are percentages, so perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of his original income that is his new expenditure. So, 0.84 I is 84% of the original income. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of his new income that is his new expenditure. That would be 0.84 I / 1.2 I = 0.7, which is 70%, not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm not seeing any other approach. Given the options, the only possible answer that makes sense is option A, 58.3%, which would be the case if his expenditure remains fixed. But according to the question, that's not the case. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.\n\n\nThe problem involves a man who spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, the question asks for his new expenditure as a percentage of his income. The options provided are A) 58.3%, B) 62.5%, C) 63.5%, D) 64.5%, and E) 65.5%.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Original Income and Expenditure**:  \n   Let the original income be denoted as \\( I \\). The man spends 70% of his income, so his original expenditure is \\( 0.7I \\).\n\n2. **New Income**:  \n   If his income increases by 20%, the new income becomes:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{New Income} = I + 0.2I = 1.2I\n   \\]\n\n3. **New Expenditure**:  \n   If the man continues to spend 70% of his income, his new expenditure would be:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{New Expenditure} = 0.7 \\times \\text{New Income} = 0.7 \\times 1.2I = 0.84I\n   \\]\n\n4. **Interpretation of the Question**:  \n   The question asks for the new expenditure as a percentage of the **new income**. Since the new income is \\( 1.2I \\), the percentage of income spent is:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{New Expenditure}}{\\text{New Income}} \\times 100 = \\frac{0.84I}{1.2I} \\times 100 = 70\\%\n   \\]  \n   However, 70% is not one of the options.\n\n5. **Alternative Interpretation**:  \n   If the man's expenditure remains fixed at \\( 0.7I \\) (i.e., he does not adjust his spending with the income increase), then the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income would be:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{Expenditure}}{\\text{New Income}} \\times 100 = \\frac{0.7I}{1.2I} \\times 100 = 58.3\\%\n   \\]  \n   This matches option A.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:  \n   While the question implies that the man spends 70% of his income, the options suggest that his expenditure is treated as a fixed amount rather than a percentage. Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that his expenditure remains fixed, and the new percentage of income spent is **58.3%**.\n\nANSWER: A",
