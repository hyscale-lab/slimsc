      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out how much each daughter receives. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe man is dividing Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. The conditions are that each daughter gets four times as much as each nephew, and each son gets five times as much as each nephew. Hmm, so all the sons, daughters, and nephews are getting money based on the nephew's share.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Maybe I can assign variables to each of these groups. Let's say the amount each nephew gets is 'x' rupees. Then, each daughter gets four times that, so 4x. Each son gets five times as much as each nephew, so 5x.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total amount distributed. There are 5 sons, so 5 times 5x. Wait, 5 sons each getting 5x would be 5 * 5x. Similarly, 4 daughters each getting 4x is 4 *4x. And 2 nephews each getting x is 2*x.\n\nLet me write that out as an equation. So the total is:\n\n5 sons * 5x + 4 daughters *4x + 2 nephews *x = 8600\n\nSo that's 25x + 16x + 2x = 8600.\n\nWait, adding those together: 25x + 16x is 41x, plus 2x makes 43x. So 43x = 8600.\n\nTo find x, I'll divide 8600 by 43. Let me do that calculation. Hmm, 43 times 200 is 8600 because 43*200=8600. So x is 200. \n\nSo each nephew gets Rs 200. Now, each daughter gets four times that. 4 * 200 = 800. So each daughter gets Rs 800.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 800. So that's the answer. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal for sons: 5 sons * (5x) = 5*5x=25x. Each son gets 5*200=1000, so 5*1000=5000.\nDaughters: 4*4x=16x. Each daughter is 800, so 4*800=3200.\nNephews: 2x=2*200=400.\nTotal: 5000 + 3200 = 8200, plus 400 is 8600. Yep, that adds up. So each daughter gets Rs 800.\n",
