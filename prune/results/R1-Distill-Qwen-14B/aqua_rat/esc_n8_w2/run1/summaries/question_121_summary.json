      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says that there are 64 boys and 40 girls in a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. Now, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. The question is, how many members does the group have now?\n\nHmm, I think I need to find the total number of members after the new people joined. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, let me note down the initial numbers. Boys: 64, Girls: 40. Then, some boys and some girls joined. Let's call the number of boys who joined 'x' and the number of girls who joined 'x' as well, because it says the same number joined from both groups. So, after the membership drive, the number of boys becomes 64 + x, and the number of girls becomes 40 + x.\n\nNow, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. So, the ratio (64 + x)/(40 + x) should be equal to 4/3. That makes sense.\n\nLet me write that equation out: (64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4 / 3.\n\nI can solve this equation for x. Cross-multiplying, I get 3*(64 + x) = 4*(40 + x). Let's compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: 3*64 is 192, plus 3x.\nRight side: 4*40 is 160, plus 4x.\n\nSo, 192 + 3x = 160 + 4x.\n\nHmm, I can subtract 3x from both sides: 192 = 160 + x.\n\nThen subtract 160: 192 -160 = x. 32 = x.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So x is 32. That means 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group.\n\nNow, let's find out the new numbers. Boys: 64 + 32 = 96. Girls: 40 + 32 = 72.\n\nSo the total members now are 96 + 72. Let me add that: 96 +72 is 168. So the total is 168.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 168. So I think E is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake in arithmetic.\n\nSo, initial boys:64, girls:40. Joined x boys and x girls. So new numbers are 64 +x and 40 +x.\n\nRatio: (64 +x)/(40 +x) =4/3.\n\nCross-multiplying: 3*(64 +x) =4*(40 +x)\n\n3*64=192, 3x. 4*40=160, 4x.\n\nSo 192 +3x =160 +4x.\n\nSubtract 3x: 192=160 +x.\n\nSubtract 160:32=x.\n\nYes, that's correct. So x=32.\n\nSo boys now:64+32=96. Girls:40+32=72.\n\nTotal:96+72=168. So option E is 168. That's one of the choices. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, looking back at the options: A)277, B)288, C)200, D)277, E)168. So yeah, E is correct.\n",

Then, during a membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined. Now, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. I need to find out how many members are in the group now.\n\nWait, so the same number of boys and girls joined. Let's call that number 'x'. So, the boys would increase by x, and the girls would also increase by x. So after the drive, the number of boys is 64 + x, and the number of girls is 40 + x.\n\nThe ratio of boys to girls is now 4:3. So, I can set up a proportion. (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3. Hmm, I think that's right because the ratio of boys to girls is 4 parts to 3 parts.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let's cross-multiply. 3*(64 + x) = 4*(40 + x). Let me calculate that. 3*64 is 192, and 3*x is 3x. On the right side, 4*40 is 160, and 4*x is 4x. So, the equation becomes 192 + 3x = 160 + 4x.\n\nWait, I can rearrange this. Let me subtract 3x from both sides. 192 = 160 + x. Then, subtract 160 from both sides. 192-160 is 32, so 32 = x. So, x is 32.\n\nSo, 32 boys and 32 girls joined. Now, the new numbers are 64 + 32 = 96 boys, and 40 + 32 = 72 girls.\n\nWait, let me check the ratio. 96 boys to 72 girls. Divide both by 24. 96/24 is 4, 72/24 is 3. So the ratio is 4:3, which matches the problem statement. So that seems correct.\n\nNow, the total number of members now is boys plus girls. 96 +72 is 168. Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 168. So that's probably the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation. Did I make any mistake in the math?\n\nLet me recheck the cross-multiplication step. (64+x)/(40+x) =4/3. Cross multiply: 3*(64+x) =4*(40+x).\n\n3*64 is 192, 3x. 4*40 is 160, 4x.\n\nSo 192 +3x =160 +4x.\n\nSubtract 3x: 192 =160 +x.\n\nSubtract 160: 32 =x. Correct.\n\nSo the total is 64+32 +40+32= 96 +72=168. Yes.\n\nLooking back at the options, E is 168, which should be the correct answer.\n",
