      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a home appliance store selling microwaves. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about averages over a period of time, so I think I'll need to calculate total sales and then find the overall average.\n\nAlright, last year they sold an average of 42 microwaves per month. Wait, last year is 12 months, right? So if I want the total sales for last year, I can multiply 42 by 12. Let me do that: 42 * 12. Hmm, 40*12 is 480, and 2*12 is 24, so adding them together gives 504. So last year, they sold 504 microwaves total.\n\nNow, this year, the first 10 months have an average of 20 per month. So to find the total for these 10 months, I multiply 20 by 10. That's easy, 20*10=200. So 200 microwaves in the first 10 months of this year.\n\nThe question is about the entire 22-month period. So that includes last year (12 months) and this year's first 10 months. So the total time is 22 months. Now I need to find the total number of microwaves sold in these 22 months and then divide by 22 to get the average.\n\nAdding last year's total and this year's first 10 months: 504 + 200. Let's see, 500+200=700, and 4 more makes 704. So total microwaves sold is 704.\n\nNow, the average per month is total divided by number of months. So 704 divided by 22. Hmm, what's 22 times 32? 22*30 is 660, 22*2 is 44, so 660+44=704. Oh, wait, so 22 *32=704. That means 704/22=32. So the average is 32 per month.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 32. So the answer should be D. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nWait, last year's total: 42*12=504. Correct. First 10 months of this year: 20*10=200. Sum is 704. 704 divided by 22: 704 \u00f722. Let me do it another way. 22*30=660, 704-660=44. 44/22=2. So 30+2=32. Yep, same result. So the average is 32. So option D is correct.\n",

Hmm, the question is about averages over a period of time. I remember that averages can sometimes be tricky, especially when dealing with different time spans.\n\nAlright, the problem says that last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwaves per month. So, last year must be 12 months, right? Because a year has 12 months. So the total number sold last year would be 42 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that. 42 times 12 is... 42*10 is 420, plus 42*2 which is 84, so 420+84=504. So last year, they sold 504 microwaves in total.\n\nThen, this year, in the first 10 months, they've sold an average of 20 per month. So that's 10 months. So the total this year so far is 20 times 10, which is 200. Wait, that's only 200. So they're selling a lot less this year than last.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the average over the entire 22-month period. Oh, right, last year was 12 months, and this year up to now is 10 months, so 12+10=22 months total.\n\nSo I need to find the average per month over these 22 months. To find the average, I need the total number of microwaves sold divided by the number of months.\n\nSo total sold is 504 (from last year) plus 200 (from this year's first 10 months). Let me add those: 504 + 200 is 704. So 704 microwaves in 22 months.\n\nNow, the average would be 704 divided by 22. Hmm, let me compute that. 22 times 30 is 660. 22*32 is 704, because 22*30 is 660, plus 2*22=44, so 660+44=704. Oh wait, that's exactly the total. So 704 divided by 22 is 32.\n\nWait a minute, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So 22 times 32 is 704, yes. So the average is 32 per month.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 32. So the answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Did I calculate the totals correctly? Last year: 42 *12=504. This year's first 10 months:20*10=200. Total is 704. 704/22=32.
