      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about percentages, which I think I can handle, but I need to make sure I understand each part correctly.\n\nThe problem says: The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. Then, the appliance was sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price. I need to find out what percent more the selling price is compared to the wholesale cost.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. Maybe I should assign some variables to make it easier. Let's say the wholesale cost is W. Then the original retail price is 60% more than W. So how do I calculate that?\n\nOh right, if something is 60% more than W, it's W plus 60% of W. Which is W*(1 + 0.60) = 1.60 * W. So the original retail price (let's call it R) is 1.6W.\n\nThen, the appliance was sold for 20% less than R. So the selling price (S) is R minus 20% of R. Or, S = R * (1 - 0.20) = 0.80 * R.\n\nWait, since R is 1.6W, substituting that in, S would be 0.80 * 1.6W. Let me calculate that. 0.8 times 1.6. Hmm, 1.6 times 0.8. Let's see: 1.6 * 0.8. Well, 1 * 0.8 is 0.8, and 0.6 * 0.8 is 0.48, so adding those gives 1.28. So S = 1.28 * W.\n\nWait, so the selling price is 1.28 times the wholesale cost. That means it's 28% more than the wholesale cost, because 1.28 is 128% of W, which is 28% above 100%.\n\nSo looking at the options, option B is 28%. That should be the answer.\n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, R is 60% more than W: R = 1.6W. Then, S is 20% less than R: S = 0.8 * R. Substituting R gives S = 0.8 *1.6 W = 1.28 W. So yes, 28% more than W. That seems right.\n\nI think I got this. So the correct answer should be option B, 28%.\n",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. Then, the appliance was sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price. The question is asking: it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost? The options are A)20%, B)28%, C)36%, D)40%, E)42%.\n\nHmm. Alright, I think I need to break this down step by step. Let's start by assigning some variables to make it easier.\n\nLet me denote the wholesale cost as W. So, the original retail price is 60% more than W. Wait, what does that mean exactly? If something is 60% more than W, that should be W plus 60% of W, right? So that's W + 0.6*W, which equals 1.6*W. So, original retail price (let's call it R) is 1.6 times W. Got that.\n\nNow, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. So, the selling price (let's call it S) is 20% less than R. Wait, 20% less than R is R minus 20% of R. So that's R*(1 - 0.2) = 0.8*R. So S = 0.8 * R.\n\nBut I need to find out how much more the selling price is compared to the wholesale cost. So, I need to compare S to W. Let's express S in terms of W.\n\nSince R is 1.6*W, then S is 0.8 * 1.6*W. Let me calculate that. 0.8 * 1.6 is... let's see, 0.8 times 1 is 0.8, 0.8 times 0.6 is 0.48. So 0.8 + 0.48 is 1.28. So S is 1.28*W. \n\nWait, so S is 1.28 times the wholesale cost. That means the selling price is 28% higher than W because 1.28 is 128% of W. So, the selling price is 28% more than the wholesale cost.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is 28%. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, R is 1.6W. Then S is 0.8 R, which is 0.8 * 1.6 W. 0.8 * 1.6 is indeed 1.28.
