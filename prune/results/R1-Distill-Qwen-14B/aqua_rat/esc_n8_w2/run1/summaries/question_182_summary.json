      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this combinatorics problem about Fernando's meal plan. Let's see what the question says.\n\nFernando bought a meal plan that allows him 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so he can't eat there on Saturday and Sunday. Also, he always goes home for dinner on Fridays. I need to figure out how many ways he can allocate his meals.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. First, the week structure: Monday to Friday, because Saturday and Sunday are weekends when the cafeteria is closed. So, he's only using the cafeteria from Monday to Friday for both lunch and dinner.\n\nWait, but he goes home for dinner on Friday. Oh right, so on Friday night, he's not using the dinner meal at the cafeteria. That means his three dinners must be used on other days.\n\nSo, for dinners, the available days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. That's four days. He has three dinners to allocate. So, he needs to choose 3 days out of these 4 to have his dinners at the cafeteria. Oh wait, that makes sense because Friday dinner is at home.\n\nSo the number of ways to choose dinner days is 4 choose 3. Because 4 days (Mon-Thu) and he picks 3 days for dinner.\n\nNow for lunches. He has 3 lunches to use. The available days are Monday to Friday, since he can have lunch every day except weekends. So that's five days. He needs to choose 3 days out of these five for his lunches. So the number of ways is 5 choose 3.\n\nWait a minute, but wait. Because each day he can have both lunch and dinner, right? So the allocation is independent for lunch and dinner. So the total number of options is the product of the two combinations.\n\nSo the total options would be (5 choose 3) multiplied by (4 choose 3). Let me check the options given.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 5C3 *4C3 \u2192 That matches what I just thought.\n\nOption B: 5C4 *4C2 \u2192 5 choose 4 is 5, and 4 choose 2 is 6. So 5*6=30. Not sure, but probably not.\n\nOption C:5C2 *4C4 \u2192 5C2 is 10, 4C4 is 1. So 10. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nOption D:5C6 *4C5 \u2192 Wait, 5 choose 6 is zero because you can't choose 6 from 5. So this is zero. Not possible.\n\nOption E:4C3 *4C3 \u2192 Both are 4, so 4*4=16. Hmm, but wait, does that make sense? Because 4C3 is 4 for dinner, and if we have 4C3 for lunch, that would be choosing 3 out of 4 days. But wait, lunch is available on 5 days (Mon-Fri), so 5C3 is correct. So E is wrong.\n\nSo the correct option is A:5C3 *4C3.\n\nWait, but wait another point. Does he have any other constraints? Like, can he have a meal on the same day for both lunch and dinner? The problem doesn't say he can't, so each day's meals are independent. So yeah, the initial reasoning holds.\n\nSo the answer should be option A.\n",

So, Friday dinner is fixed\u2014he doesn't eat at the cafeteria that day.\n\nWait, so how does this affect his meal allocation? Let's think about each day.\n\nThe week has 7 days. But the cafeteria is closed on Saturday and Sunday. So, the days he can eat at the cafeteria are Monday to Friday. That's 5 days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri.\n\nBut wait, on Friday nights, he goes home. So, does that mean he can't have dinner at the cafeteria on Friday? Yes. So, for dinners, the only days he can eat at the cafeteria are Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu. That's four days.

Let's think about each separately.\n\nFor lunches: He has 5 days (Mon-Fri) and needs to choose 3 days to eat lunch there. So the number of ways to choose 3 days out of 5 is \"5 choose 3\", which is written as 5C3.\n\nFor dinners: He can't eat on Friday, so he has 4 days (Mon-Thu) to choose from. He needs 3 dinners. So the number of ways is \"4 choose 3\", written as 4C3.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem says he has a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners. Does that mean he has to use all of them each week? So he can't skip any? So he must have exactly 3 lunches and exactly 3 dinners.\n\nWait, the question says \"allows him to have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week.\" So he must use all 3 lunches and all 3 dinners. So, for each meal, he can't have more than 3, but he has to have exactly 3.\n\nWait, but that's how I interpreted it earlier. So for lunch, he picks 3 days out of 5, and for dinner, 3 out of 4.\n\nSo the total number of options is the product of these two combinations: 5C3 multiplied by 4C3.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 5C3 * 4C3, which matches my calculation.\n\nWait, let me check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B: 5C4 *4C2. Hmm, 5 choose 4 is 5, and 4 choose 2 is 6. So 5*6=30. But why would that be? I don't think that's correct because we need 3 for each.\n\nOption C:5C2 *4C4. 5C2 is 10, 4C4 is 1. So 10*1=10. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption D:5C6*4C5. Wait, 5 choose 6 is zero because you can't choose 6 from 5. So that's invalid.\n\nOption E:4C3*4C3. So 4 choose 3 is 4, so 4*4=16.
