      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?\n\nHmm. Alright, so I remember that when two events are independent, the probability of both happening is the product of their individual probabilities. Also, the probability of at least one occurring is given by the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) is P(A) * P(B).\n\nWait, right. So let me jot down what I know:\n\n- P(A) = 0.6\n- P(A or B) = 0.96\n- A and B are independent, so P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B)\n\nSo I can set up the equation using the formula for P(A or B).\n\nSo P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B) = 0.96.\n\nPlugging in the known value of P(A) = 0.6, the equation becomes:\n\n0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)) = 0.96.\n\nLet me simplify that. Let's factor out P(B) where possible.\n\n0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6) = 0.96.\n\nBecause 0.6 * P(B) is subtracted, so it's P(B) multiplied by (1 - 0.6), which is 0.4. So,\n\n0.6 + 0.4 * P(B) = 0.96.\n\nNow, subtract 0.6 from both sides:\n\n0.4 * P(B) = 0.96 - 0.6 \u2192 0.4 * P(B) = 0.36.\n\nWait, 0.96 minus 0.6 is 0.36. So,\n\nP(B) = 0.36 / 0.4.\n\nCalculating that, 0.36 divided by 0.4 is the same as 36 divided by 40, which is 0.9. Oh wait, no, wait, 36 divided by 40 is 0.9? Let me check that again. Wait, 40 times 0.9 is 36, yes. So P(B) is 0.9.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So:\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B) \u2192 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 P(B).\n\nWhich can be rewritten as 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6) \u2192 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 P(B).\n\nSubtract 0.6 from both sides: 0.36 = 0.4 P(B).\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4: P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9.\n\nSo the probability that event B occurs is 0.9. Looking back at the options, option E is 0.9. So the answer should be E.\n",

Hmm, I remember that independent events mean that the occurrence of one doesn't affect the probability of the other. So, the probability of both happening is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nThe probability that event A occurs is 0.6. So P(A) = 0.6. Got that. And the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. So P(A or B) = 0.96. I need to find P(B).\n\nWait, how do I find P(B) from this information? I think I remember that for two events, the probability of A or B is equal to P(A) + P(B) minus P(A and B). Oh right, because when you add them, the overlap is counted twice, so you subtract it once.\n\nBut since A and B are independent, P(A and B) is just P(A) * P(B). So the formula becomes P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B) = P(A or B). \n\nLet me plug in the numbers. I know P(A) is 0.6 and P(A or B) is 0.96. Let me set up the equation:\n\n0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)) = 0.96.\n\nHmm, let me simplify this. Let's combine like terms. So 0.6 plus P(B) times (1 - 0.6) equals 0.96. Wait, no, let me do it step by step.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 * P(B) = 0.96.\n\nFactor P(B) terms: 0.6 + P(B)*(1 - 0.6) = 0.96.\n\n1 - 0.6 is 0.4, so:\n\n0.6 + 0.4 * P(B) = 0.96.\n\nNow I can subtract 0.6 from both sides:\n\n0.4 * P(B) = 0.96 - 0.6.\n\n0.96 minus 0.6 is 0.36.

Because sometimes I might make a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, 0.36 divided by 0.4. 0.4 times 0.9 is 0.36. Yeah, that's right. So P(B) is 0.9. But wait, let me think again. If P(A) is 0.6 and P(B) is 0.9, then P(A and B) is 0.6 * 0.9 = 0.54.\n\nSo P(A or B) is 0.6 + 0.9 - 0.54 = 0.96, which matches the given value.

Let me think if I made any mistakes in the formula.\n\nWait, another approach: the probability that at least one occurs is 1 - probability that neither occurs. So:\n\nP(A or B) = 1 - P(not A and not B).\n\nSince A and B are independent, not A and not B are also independent. So P(not A and not B) = P(not A) * P(not B).\n\nP(not A) is 1 - 0.6 = 0.4. P(not B) is 1 - x (where x is P(B)).\n\nSo,\n\n0.96 = 1 - (0.4 * (1 - x)).\n\nLet's solve this:\n\n0.96 = 1 - 0.4*(1 - x)\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n-0.04 = -0.4*(1 - x)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n0.04 = 0.4*(1 - x)\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4:\n\n0.1 = 1 - x\n\nSo x = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nSame result.
