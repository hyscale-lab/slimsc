      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem says: A certain liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. At that rate, how many minutes will it take y gallons to pass through the drain?\n\nHmm, right. So I need to find the time in minutes when y gallons pass. Let me think about rates and units.\n\nFirst, the rate is given as w/25 gallons every x seconds. So the rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. To make it easier, maybe I should find the rate in gallons per second and then convert that into minutes.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to find the time it takes for y gallons. So, rate multiplied by time equals amount. So, time equals amount divided by rate.\n\nBut let's get the units right. The rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So the rate is (w/25) / x gallons per second. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, if it's w/25 gallons every x seconds, then the rate is (w/25) divided by x seconds. So rate = (w/(25x)) gallons per second.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's see. If in x seconds, it's w/25 gallons, then the rate is (w/25) divided by x. So yes, (w/(25x)) gallons per second.\n\nBut maybe another approach is better. Let's think in terms of units. I need to find the time in minutes for y gallons to pass.\n\nSo the rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So the time for y gallons would be y divided by (w/(25x)) seconds. Then convert that to minutes by dividing by 60.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So the time taken for y gallons would be (y) divided by the rate (w/(25x)).\n\nWait, let's write that out. Time in seconds = y / ( (w/(25x)) ) \n\nBecause rate is gallons per second, so time = amount / rate.\n\nSo that's y * (25x / w ) = (25xy)/w seconds.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for time in minutes. So I need to convert seconds to minutes. Since 1 minute is 60 seconds, I divide by 60.\n\nSo time in minutes = (25xy)/(w * 60) \n\nSimplify that: 25xy/(60w) = 5xy/(12w). \n\nWait, 25 divided by 60 is 5/12. So yeah, 25xy/(60w) = (5xy)/(12w).\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5xy/(12w), which matches. So the answer should be C.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: How many x seconds intervals are needed to get y gallons?\n\nEach x seconds, you get w/25 gallons. So number of intervals needed is y / (w/25) ) = 25y/(w) intervals. Each interval is x seconds, so total time in seconds is 25y/(w) * x = 25xy/w seconds. Then convert to minutes by dividing by 60: 25xy/(60w) = 5xy/(12w) minutes. Same as before.\n\nSo yes, the correct answer is option C.\n",

That means in x seconds, w/25 gallons go through. So, to find the time for y gallons, I need to figure out how long it takes for y gallons to pass at this rate.\n\nI remember that rate is generally amount over time. So, rate = amount/time. So, in this case, the rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So, the rate in gallons per second would be (w/25)/x, right? Or wait, no. Wait, the rate is (w/25) gallons in x seconds, so per second, it's (w/25) divided by x. So rate r = (w)/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms of units. Let me see. So, the given rate is w/25 gallons every x seconds. So, to get the time for y gallons, I can set up a proportion.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the time it takes per gallon and then multiply by y. Let me think.\n\nIf (w/25) gallons take x seconds, then 1 gallon would take (x * 25)/w seconds. Because if you have w/25 gallons in x seconds, each gallon is x divided by (w/25), which is x * (25/w) seconds per gallon.\n\nSo, time per gallon is (25x)/w seconds.

There are 60 seconds in a minute. So, I divide the total seconds by 60.\n\nSo the total time in minutes is [y*(25x)/w ] / 60. Let me compute that: (25xy)/(60w) = (5xy)/(12w) because 25 divided by 5 is 5, 60 divided by 5 is 12. So that's 5xy/(12w) minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5xy/(12w).

It's (w/25) divided by x, which is w/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the rate is (w/25) gallons in x seconds, so per second, it's (w/25)/x = w/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to find the time. Because the problem is asking for how many minutes it takes for y gallons to pass.\n\nTime is equal to amount divided by rate.

So same result.\n\nAlternatively, think in terms of unit conversion.\n\nWe can set up the equation: Time (in minutes) = (y gallons) * (x seconds) / (w/25 gallons) * (1 minute / 60 seconds).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe rate is (w/25) gallons every x seconds. So, in terms of units:\n\n(w/25) gallons / x seconds = rate.\n\nWe can invert that to get the time per gallon: (x seconds) / (w/25 gallons) = (25x/w) seconds per gallon.\n\nThen, time for y gallons is y * (25x/w) seconds.
