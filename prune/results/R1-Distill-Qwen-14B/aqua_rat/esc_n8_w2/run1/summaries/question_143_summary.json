      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about two cars. Both start from the same point and same time, going the same direction. The first car is going at 55 mph, and the second is at 52 mph. The question is asking how long it'll take until they're 15 miles apart. Hmm, let me think.\n\nWait, so both are moving in the same direction. That means the faster car is catching up, but since they're moving away, I think I need to find the time when the distance between them is 15 miles. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, since the first car is faster, it will be ahead of the second. So the distance between them increases over time. Wait, no, that can't be. If they're going the same direction, the faster car is pulling ahead, so the distance between them increases.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the first car is faster, so it will get ahead of the second. So the distance between them will be the difference in their speeds multiplied by time. Because for each hour, the first car goes 55, the second 52. So every hour, the first car is 3 miles ahead. So the relative speed is 3 mph.\n\nSo the question is, when will the distance between them be 15 miles. Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed is 55-52 = 3 mph. So time = distance / speed. So time = 15 / 3 = 5 hours. So the answer should be B) 5 hours.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes, relative speed can be tricky. Let me think again. Both start at the same point and same time. So after time t, the first car has gone 55t miles, the second 52t miles. The distance between them is 55t -52t = 3t. We want that to be 15 miles. So 3t =15, so t=5. Yep, that seems right.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. Two cars start from the same point and go in the same direction. They both started at the same time. The first car is going 55 mph, and the second is going 52 mph. The question is, how much time will pass before they are 15 miles apart?\n\nHmm. Right, since they're going in the same direction, the distance between them depends on their relative speed. Oh wait, relative speed is the difference between their speeds because they're moving in the same direction. So the faster car is catching up, but wait, no, because the first is faster than the second. So the first car will be pulling ahead. The relative speed is 55 minus 52, which is 3 mph.\n\nSo the distance between them increases at 3 mph. We need the time when this distance is 15 miles. Oh, right, time equals distance divided by speed. So time is 15 miles divided by 3 mph. That would be 5 hours. Let me check the options.\n\nThe options are A)3, B)5, C)6, D)4, E)7. So B is 5 hours.
