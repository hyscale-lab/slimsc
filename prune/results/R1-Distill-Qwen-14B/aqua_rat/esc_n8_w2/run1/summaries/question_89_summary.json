      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a cow grazing in a field. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nThe cow is tied in the middle of the field with a 14-foot rope. So I'm thinking, the area the cow can graze is a circle with a radius of 14 feet. Oh wait, right, because the cow can move around the center point, so the area is \u03c0r\u00b2. \n\nCalculating that, the radius r is 14 feet. So the area would be \u03c0 times 14 squared. Let me compute that. 14 squared is 196, so 196\u03c0 square feet. Hmm, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so 196 * 3.1416 is... let me do that math. 200 *3.1416 is 628.32, but subtract 4*3.1416 which is about 12.5664. So 628.32 minus 12.5664 is about 615.7536. So approximately 615.75 square feet is the area the cow can graze.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the cow grazes 10 square feet per day. So to find out how many days it takes to graze the whole area, I divide the total area by the daily grazing rate. \n\nSo 615.75 divided by 10 equals 61.575 days. Since the options are in whole numbers, I need to round this. 61.575 is closer to 62 days, but looking at the options, the closest one is B) 61 days, or wait, wait. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are A)51, B)61, C)71, D)81, E)91. Oh wait, 61.575 is approximately 61.58 days. So 61.58 is about 62, but the options don't have 62. Hmm, the options are 51, 61, 71, etc. So the closest is B)61 days. Or wait, maybe the problem is expecting an approximate time, perhaps I should round down?\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me double-check. The radius is 14 feet, so area is \u03c0*(14)^2 = \u03c0*196. Let me compute 196 * 3.14. 196 *3 is 588, 196*0.14 is 27.44. So 588 +27.44=615.44. So approximately 615.44 square feet.\n\nDivided by 10 square feet per day: 615.44 /10 =61.544 days. So about 61.5 days. So that's approximately 62 days, but the options don't have that. The options are 61, 71, etc. So 61 is the closest. So the answer should be B)61 days. \n\nWait, but wait another thing. Is the cow tethered in the middle, so the area is a full circle? Or is the field maybe a square and the cow can't graze beyond the field? The problem says the cow is tethered in the middle of a field, but doesn't specify the field's size. So I think we can assume the field is large enough so that the rope allows the cow to graze the entire circle without being limited by field boundaries. So the area is indeed the full circle.\n\nSo the calculation is correct. 61.5 days, so the closest option is B)61 days.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a cow tethered in a field with a 14-foot rope. The question is asking how many days it'll take for the cow to graze the whole field if it eats 10 square feet per day. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when an animal is tethered with a rope, the area it can graze is a circle. The radius of that circle is the length of the rope. Oh wait, but in this case, the cow is in the middle of the field, so I guess the rope isn't limited by any fences or anything. So the maximum area it can graze is a full circle with radius 14 feet.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is \u03c0r\u00b2. Let me calculate that. So r is 14, so r squared is 14*14. Let me compute that. 14 times 14 is 196. Multiply by \u03c0 (approximately 3.1416) gives me 196 * 3.1416. Hmm, what's that roughly? Let me do 200 * 3.14 which is 628, but since it's 196, which is 4 less than 200. 4 * 3.14 is about 12.56. So 628 minus 12.56 is 615.44 square feet. So the total area is approximately 615.44 sq ft.\n\nWait, wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused. If the cow is in the middle of the field, maybe the field is a circle? Or is it a different shape? The problem says it's tethered in the middle of a field, but doesn't specify the field's shape. Hmm, but for the purpose of this problem, I think we can assume the field is a circle with radius equal to the rope length because the cow can graze all around. Otherwise, if the field were bigger, the cow's grazing area would be limited, but the problem doesn't mention any constraints on the field's size. So I'll proceed with the area being the full circle.\n\nSo the total area is about 615.44 sq ft. The cow grazes 10 sq ft per day. To find out how many days it takes, I divide the total area by the daily grazing rate.\n\nSo 615.44 / 10 equals 61.544 days. Hmm, looking at the options, the closest is 61 days (Option B) or maybe 71 days. Wait, 61.544 is approximately 61.5 days. So the options are A)51, B)61, C)71, etc. So 61.5 is closer to 62, but the options don't have 62. So the closest option is B)61 days.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem says the rope is 14 feet long. So the area is \u03c0*(14)^2. Let me recalculate that precisely. 14 squared is 196. 196 * \u03c0 is approximately 615.751 sq ft. So yeah, about 615.75. Divided by 10 gives 61.575 days. So that's approximately 61.58 days. So the question is, is it 61 days or 62? But the options don't have 62. The options are 51, 61, 71, etc. So 61 is the closest, so the answer is B.\n\nBut wait another thought. Could there be any other factors? Like, maybe the cow can't graze the entire circle? For example, if the field is a square, the cow's grazing area would be limited. But the question doesn't specify, so I think the safe assumption is that the field is a circle. Otherwise, without knowing the field's shape, the problem can't be solved. So yeah, I'll stick with the circle area.\n\nSo the total area is about 615.75, divided by 10 per day is about 61.58 days. So approximately 62 days, but since the options don't have that, the next lower is 61 days. So the answer is B)61 days.\n",
