      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 900 plus 5 times 12. Hmm, let me think about how to solve it. Wait, I remember from school that when solving equations, I should follow the order of operations. Oh right, PEMDAS! Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction. So first, I should handle the multiplication before adding.\n\nAlright, so the problem is 900 + 5 \u00d7 12. Let's break it down. The multiplication part is 5 times 12. What's 5 times 12? Let me calculate that. 5 multiplied by 10 is 50, and 5 times 2 is 10. So 50 plus 10 is 60. So 5\u00d712 is 60.\n\nNow, substituting that back into the equation, it becomes 900 + 60. Adding those together, 900 plus 60. Well, 900 plus 60 is straightforward. 900 plus 60 is 960. So the result should be 960.\n\nLooking at the options given: A is 820, B is 202, C is 420, D is 209, and E is 960. So the correct answer should be E) 960.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the order. Sometimes, people might add first, but no, multiplication comes before addition. So yeah, 5\u00d712 first, then add to 900. Yep, that's definitely right. So the answer is E.\n",
