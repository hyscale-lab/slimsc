      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the perimeter of a rectangular piece of land. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe area is 150 square meters. The length is 1 meter more than four times the breadth. Hmm, right. So the length depends on the breadth. I think I should set up some variables to model this.\n\nLet me denote the breadth as 'b' meters. Then, the length would be 4 times the breadth plus 1, so length 'l' equals 4b + 1. Got that down.\n\nThe area of a rectangle is length multiplied by breadth, so the formula is Area = l * b. We know the area is 150, so I can write the equation as 150 = l * b. Substituting the expression for l, that becomes 150 = (4b + 1) * b.\n\nExpanding that, I get 150 = 4b\u00b2 + b. Wait, that's a quadratic equation. Let me rearrange it to standard form. Subtract 150 from both sides: 4b\u00b2 + b - 150 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for b. The quadratic is 4b\u00b2 + b - 150 = 0. I can use the quadratic formula here. The formula is (-B \u00b1 sqrt(B\u00b2 - 4AC)) / (2A), where A is 4, B is 1, and C is -150.\n\nCalculating the discriminant first: B\u00b2 - 4AC. That's (1)^2 - 4*4*(-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401. Oh, the square root of 2401 is 49, right? Because 49*49 is 2401.\n\nSo plugging back into the quadratic formula: (-1 \u00b1 49) / (2*4). That gives two possible solutions. Let's calculate both.\n\nFirst, (-1 + 49) / 8 = 48/8 = 6. Second, (-1 -49)/8 = -50/8 = -6.25. Since breadth can't be negative, we'll take the positive solution, which is 6 meters. So the breadth is 6 meters.\n\nNow, find the length. l = 4b +1 = 4*6 +1 = 24 +1 = 25 meters. So length is 25 m and breadth is 6 m.\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + breadth). So plugging in the values: 2*(25 +6) = 2*31 = 62 meters.\n\nWait, let me check the options again. The options are A)60, B)61, C)62, D)63, E)64. So 62 is option C. That must be the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check the quadratic equation solution. The equation was 4b\u00b2 + b -150 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: b = [-1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 2400)] /8. Sqrt(2401) is 49. So [ -1 +49 ]/8 is 48/8=6, correct. So the calculations seem right.\n\nAnother way to check: area is 6*25=150, which matches the given area. So yes, the perimeter is 2*(25+6)=62. So the answer is C.\n",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: A rectangular piece of 150 square meters has a length which is 1 meter more than four times the breadth. I need to find the perimeter. The options are from A to E, with values ranging from 60 to 64 meters.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and breadth (or width). The formula is Area = length \u00d7 breadth. And the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as P = 2\u00d7(length + breadth).\n\nThe problem gives me the area, which is 150 sq m. So, if I let the breadth be some variable, say 'b', then the length would be four times that plus one. Let me write that down.\n\nLet me denote the breadth as 'b' meters. Then, the length 'l' would be 4b + 1. Because it's 1m more than four times the breadth.\n\nSo, using the area formula:\nArea = l \u00d7 b = (4b + 1) \u00d7 b = 150.\n\nExpanding that, I get 4b\u00b2 + b = 150. Hmm, that's a quadratic equation. Let me rearrange it to standard form.\n\n4b\u00b2 + b - 150 = 0.\n\nNow I need to solve this quadratic equation for b. Quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula: b = [-B \u00b1 sqrt(B\u00b2 - 4AC)] / (2A), where A is the coefficient of b\u00b2, B of b, and C the constant term.\n\nIn this equation, A is 4, B is 1, and C is -150.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\nDiscriminant D = B\u00b2 - 4AC = (1)^2 - 4*4*(-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401.\n\nSquare root of 2401 is... let me think. 49 squared is 2401 because 49*49 is 2401. So sqrt(2401) = 49.\n\nSo, b = [-1 \u00b1 49]/(2*4). \n\nLet me calculate both possibilities.\n\nFirst, the positive root: [-1 +49] = 48. 48/(8) =6. So b=6 meters.\n\nThe other root: [-1 -49] =-50. Divided by 8, that's -6.25 meters. But a breadth can't be negative, so we discard that. So breadth is 6 meters.\n\nNow, the length is 4b +1. So plugging in b=6: 4*6=24 +1=25 meters. So length is 25 m.\n\nWait, let me double-check the area: 25 *6 =150. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, to find the perimeter. Perimeter P = 2*(length + breadth) = 2*(25 +6) = 2*(31) =62 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 62 m. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me go through the steps again quickly.\n\nQuadratic equation: 4b\u00b2 +b -150=0. Using quadratic formula, A=4, B=1, C=-150.\n\nDiscriminant: 1 + 2400=2401. Square root is 49.\n\nSo solutions are ( -1 +49)/8 =48/8=6, and (-1-49)/8=-50/8=-6.25. So breadth is 6 m.\n\nLength is 4*6+1=25 m.\n\nPerimeter: 2*(25+6)=2*31=62. Yep, that's right. So the perimeter is 62 meters, option C.\n",
