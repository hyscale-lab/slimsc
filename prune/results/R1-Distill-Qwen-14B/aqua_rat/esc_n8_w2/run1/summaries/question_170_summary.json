      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased?\n\nWait, the options are labeled A to E, each with a number of trousers. Hmm, I think the question is asking for the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding 810 rupees. Once we find that, we can find out how many shirts he bought and then the ratio.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The man has a total of 810 rupees. He buys both trousers and shirts. Each trouser costs 70, and each shirt is 30. We need to maximize the number of trousers, which would minimize the number of shirts.\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as 't' and the number of shirts as 's'. The total cost equation would be:\n\n70t + 30s = 810\n\nOur goal is to maximize 't', so we need to find the largest possible integer value of 't' such that when multiplied by 70 and subtracted from 810, the remaining amount can be exactly divided by 30 for the shirts.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation to solve for 's' in terms of 't':\n\n30s = 810 - 70t\ns = (810 - 70t)/30\n\nSince 's' must be a non-negative integer, (810 -70t) must be divisible by 30 and result in a non-negative number. Also, 70t must be less than or equal to 810.\n\nLet me find the maximum possible 't'. So, I'll compute the maximum 't' where 70t \u2264810.\n\nt_max = 810 /70 \u2248 11.57. But since 't' has to be an integer, the maximum possible t would be 11, but wait, let's check if that's possible.\n\nWait, let's compute 70 *11 = 770. Then the remaining money is 810-770=40. Now, 40 divided by 30 is 1.333... which is not an integer. So, s would be 1.333, which isn't possible because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt.\n\nSo, t=11 is not possible because s isn't an integer. So, let's try t=10. 70*10=700. Remaining money is 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... which is again not an integer. So s=3.666 is not possible.\n\nNext, t=9. 70*9=630. Remaining money:810-630=180. 180/30=6. So s=6. That's an integer, so this is a valid solution.\n\nWait, but before we settle on t=9, maybe we can check higher t values beyond 11? Wait, 11.57 is the limit, so t can't be more than 11. We tried 11 and 10, which didn't work. Let's go back and check t=8.\n\nt=8: 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30=8.333... not integer. So no.\n\nt=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30\u224810.666. Not integer.\n\nt=6: 420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. So s=13. But since we're looking for maximum t, t=9 is higher than t=6. So t=9 is better.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of t=11 and t=10 not working. What about t=12? Let me check: 70*12=840. But 840>810, so it's over the budget. So t can't be 12. So maximum possible t is 11, but that doesn't give an integer s.\n\nSo the next possible is t=9, which gives s=6. So the ratio of t to s is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question isn't asking for the ratio, it's asking for the ratio when maximum t is purchased, but the options just list the number of trousers. Wait, wait, looking back, the question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" Hmm, but the options are giving the number of trousers. Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me re-read.\n\nThe options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So the question is asking what's the maximum number of trousers he can buy. Because the options are only the number of trousers.\n\nWait, in that case, the question is simply asking for the maximum t where 70t \u2264810 and (810-70t) is divisible by 30.\n\nSo, the maximum t possible.\n\nEarlier, when t=11: 70*11=770, 810-770=40, which is 40. 40 isn't divisible by 30. So no.\n\nt=10: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666\u2026 no.\n\nt=9: 630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So s=6.\n\nSo t=9 is the maximum where s is integer. So the answer would be 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but why can't we have more than 9? Because after 9, t=10 and 11 don't give integer s. So 9 is the maximum.\n",

The question is about finding the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers, so I need to figure out which option gives the maximum number of trousers while not exceeding the total amount spent.\n\nHmm, so the total money spent is 810. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. Each trouser costs 70, so total spent on trousers is 70*T. Each shirt is 30, so total on shirts is 30*S. The sum of these is 810, so the equation is 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about maximizing the number of trousers, T. So I need to find the largest possible integer value of T such that 70T plus 30S equals 810, and S is also a non-negative integer because you can't buy a negative number of shirts.\n\nSo, let's rearrange the equation to express S in terms of T. Subtract 70T from both sides: 30S = 810 - 70T. Then, divide both sides by 30: S = (810 -70T)/30.\n\nSimplify that, 810 divided by 30 is 27, and 70 divided by 30 is 7/3. So S = 27 - (7/3)T. But since S has to be an integer, (7/3)T must result in an integer when subtracted from 27.\n\nWait, another approach: 70T must leave a remainder when subtracted from 810 that is divisible by 30. Because 30S must be an integer. So, 70T <=810, so maximum T is 810//70. Let me calculate that. 70*11 is 770, 70*12 is 840 which is over 810, so T can be up to 11. So let's check T=11 first.\n\nAt T=11: 70*11=770. Then 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333... which is not an integer. So S would be 1.333, which isn't possible because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So T=11 is not possible.\n\nNext, T=10. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30 is 3.666... Again, not an integer. So S would be 3.666, which is invalid.\n\nT=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. That's an integer. So S=6. So when T=9, S=6. That's a valid combination.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a higher T possible? Let me check T=12? No, 70*12=840 which is over 810. So the next possible T after 9 would have been 10 and 11, which we saw don't work.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, and the number of shirts is 6. The ratio of trousers to shirts would be 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio when maximum T is purchased, which is 9. Looking at the options, option A is 9 Trousers, so that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check if there's a T higher than 9 that could possibly work. Let's see, T=10 and 11 didn't work. What about T=8? Let's calculate for thoroughness.\n\nAt T=8: 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30 is about 8.333. Not integer. So no. T=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666... Not integer. Hmm, what about T=6? 70*6=420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. So S=13. That's valid, but T=6 is less than 9, so 9 is higher.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers he can buy is 9, and the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2.

But the question only asks for the number of trousers when maximum is bought, which is 9, so the answer is option A.\n\n\nTo determine the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased with 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees, we start with the equation:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of trousers and \\(S\\) is the number of shirts. Rearranging for \\(S\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{810 - 70T}{30}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(S\\) must be a non-negative integer, \\((810 - 70T)\\) must be divisible by 30. To maximize \\(T\\), we calculate the largest possible integer value of \\(T\\) such that \\(70T \\leq 810\\). Dividing 810 by 70 gives:\n\n\\[\nT \\leq \\frac{810}{70} \\approx 11.57\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum possible \\(T\\) is 11. We test \\(T = 11\\):\n\n\\[\n70 \\times 11 = 770, \\quad 810 - 770 = 40, \\quad S = \\frac{40}{30} \\approx 1.33\n\\]\n\nSince \\(S\\) is not an integer, \\(T = 11\\) is invalid. Next, we test \\(T = 10\\):\n\n\\[\n70 \\times 10 = 700, \\quad 810 - 700 = 110, \\quad S = \\frac{110}{30} \\approx 3.67\n\\]\n\nAgain, \\(S\\) is not an integer, so \\(T = 10\\) is invalid. Testing \\(T = 9\\):\n\n\\[\n70 \\times 9 = 630, \\quad 810 - 630 = 180, \\quad S = \\frac{180}{30} = 6\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(S = 6\\) is an integer, so \\(T = 9\\) is valid. Testing higher values of \\(T\\) (e.g., \\(T = 12\\)) exceeds the total budget, and lower values of \\(T\\) (e.g., \\(T = 8, 7, 6\\)) yield valid combinations but result in fewer trousers than \\(T = 9\\). Therefore, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 9.\n\nThe ratio of trousers to shirts is \\(9:6\\), which simplifies to \\(3:2\\), but the question only asks for the number of trousers when the maximum is purchased. Thus, the answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",
