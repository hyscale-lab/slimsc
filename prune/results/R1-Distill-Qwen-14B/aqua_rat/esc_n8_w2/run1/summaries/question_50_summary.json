      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where the price of a product is reduced by 30%, and I need to figure out by what percentage it should be increased to bring it back to 100% of its original price. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. Suppose the original price is 100 units. When it's reduced by 30%, the new price becomes 70 units because 30% off of 100 is 30, so 100-30=70. Now, I need to find the percentage increase needed on this 70 to get back to 100.\n\nWait, right, so the question is asking what percentage increase from 70 will bring it back to 100. Let me remember the formula for percentage increase. It's ((Final - Initial)/Initial) * 100. So here, the initial is 70, and the final is 100.\n\nCalculating the difference first: 100 -70 =30. So the increase needed is 30 units. Now, to find what percentage 30 is of the initial 70, I do (30/70)*100.\n\nLet me compute that. 30 divided by 70 is approximately 0.42857. Multiply by 100 gives 42.857%. So that's about 42.86%. Looking at the options, option B is 42.86%.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If I take 70 and increase it by 42.86%, what do I get? Let's see: 42.86% of 70 is 30, so adding that to 70 gives 100. Yep, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be option B.\n",

Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nWait, so the original price is 100%, right? If it's reduced by 30%, that means the new price is 70% of the original. Because 100% minus 30% is 70%. Got that part.\n\nNow, the question is, what percentage increase on this reduced price will bring it back to 100%? So, I think I need to find the percentage increase from 70% to 100%. But wait, percentage increase is calculated based on the original value, right?\n\nLet me think of it numerically. Suppose the original price is $100. A 30% discount would make it $70. Now, I want to find what percentage increase of $70 will get me back to $100. So the increase needed is $30 (from 70 to 100). \n\nSo the formula for percentage increase is (Increase / Original) * 100%. Here, the original is $70. So it's (30 / 70) * 100.

So that's the answer. \n\nWait, but I should make sure I didn't mix up anything. The key point is that the percentage is calculated relative to the reduced price, not the original. So yeah, it's 30 over 70, not 30 over 100. That makes sense because the increase is based on the new amount after the discount.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Let\u2019s call the original price P. After a 30% decrease, the new price is 0.7P. Let the required percentage increase be x. So, 0.7P * (1 + x) = P. Solving for x: 1 + x = 1/0.7 \u2248 1.42857.
