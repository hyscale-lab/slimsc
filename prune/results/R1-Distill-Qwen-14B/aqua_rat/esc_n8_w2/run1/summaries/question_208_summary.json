      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation problem here. The question is asking for the largest integer value of 'k' such that the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, I remember that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant plays a crucial role in determining the nature of the roots.\n\nWait, the discriminant is b\u00b2 - 4ac. Right, and for the equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive. So I need to set up the inequality based on that.\n\nLet me write down the equation again: x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Comparing this to the standard form, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. So the discriminant D would be (-5)\u00b2 -4*(1)*k. Calculating that, D=25 -4k.\n\nSo for two real and distinct roots, D must be greater than zero. That gives me 25 -4k >0. Let's solve that inequality.\n\n25 -4k >0 \u2192 25 >4k \u2192 Dividing both sides by 4, 25/4 >k. 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. But the question asks for the largest integral value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6, right? Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 6 as an option. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nHmm, did I make a mistake here? Let me double-check my steps. The equation is correct: a=1, b=-5, c=k. Discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac \u2192 (-5)^2 is 25, 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So yes, discriminant is 25-4k. For real and distinct roots, D>0 \u2192 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k<25 \u2192 k<25/4=6.25.\n\nWait, so the maximum integer k can be is 6. But the options don't include 6. Did I misread the question? Let me check the options again: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So none of these are 6. That's confusing. Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the largest integer less than or equal to 6.25, which is 6. But since 6 isn't an option, maybe I messed up the discriminant calculation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the discriminant. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. Here, a=1, b=-5, c=k. So b\u00b2 is (-5)^2=25. 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So discriminant is 25-4k. That's correct. So when is this positive? 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k<25 \u2192 k<6.25.\n\nHmm, so the maximum integer is 6, but it's not in the options. Wait, maybe the options have a typo? Or perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, let me look again at the equation. Oh, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. Wait, is that correct? Yes. So the discriminant is 25 -4k. So for D>0, k must be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But in the options, the closest lower is 3, and higher is 7, 8, 9,12.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the equation? Could it be x\u00b2 -5x -k=0? No, the question says x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is phrased as 'two real and distinct roots' but I'm looking for the largest k where that's possible. So if k is larger, the discriminant is smaller. So the largest possible k is 6, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer isn't there. But that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant.\n\nWait another thought: What if I set up the equation correctly but perhaps the discriminant condition is different? No, for two real and distinct roots, D must be greater than zero. So that part is correct.\n\nWait, the options given are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So the largest among these is E)12. But 12 is way higher than 6.25, so that would give D=25-4*12=25-48= -23, which is negative. So that would lead to no real roots. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about two real and equal roots, but no, the question says distinct.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 +5x +k=0? No, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Since none of the options match 6, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the question is to find the maximum integer k such that the equation has two real roots, not necessarily distinct. Because sometimes, people confuse between distinct and real. But the question says 'two real and distinct', so discriminant must be positive, not zero.\n\nWait, maybe I can try plugging in the options into the discriminant to see which one is the largest that still gives a positive discriminant.\n\nLet's see. Let's take option D)8. So k=8.\n\nDiscriminant D=25 -4*8=25-32= -7. Which is negative. So that would give two complex roots, not real. So that's not acceptable.\n\nOption B)7: D=25-28= -3 \u2192 negative. Still no good.\n\nOption A)9: 25-36= -11 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption E)12: 25-48= -23 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption C)3: 25-12=13 \u2192 positive. So k=3 is acceptable. But that's the smallest option. So the largest k that works is 6, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question is incorrect, or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, so a=1, b= -5, c=k. So discriminant is (-5)^2 -4(1)(k) =25-4k.\n\nSet 25-4k>0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 k<25/4=6.25. So maximum integer is 6.\n\nBut none of the options are 6. So perhaps the problem is about maximum k for which the equation has two real roots (could be same or different), in which case discriminant must be >=0. So the maximum k would be 6.25, so 6 is the maximum integer. But again, not in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check the options again. Let me read the options again: the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So 6 isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but perhaps I'm supposed to find the maximum k where the equation has two real roots (distinct or not), which would allow discriminant >=0. So then 25-4k >=0 \u2192 k <=6.25. So maximum integer is 6. Still not in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is to find the largest k such that the equation has two real roots, regardless of whether they are distinct. So the same reasoning applies: k must be \u22646.25. So 6 is the largest integer. But that's not an option. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I read the problem wrong. Let me read it again: the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 will have two real and distinct roots. So the discriminant must be positive. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 k<6.25.\n\nSo the largest integer k is 6. But in the options, the maximum is 12. So perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake elsewhere.\n\nWait another approach: perhaps the problem is written as x\u00b2 -5k x + something else, but no, the problem says x\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the quadratic equation in terms of x and k, but that doesn't make sense because k is a constant here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not correctly stated, or perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant. Let me try plugging each option into the discriminant.\n\nLet's try option D)8.\n\nk=8: discriminant is 25-32= -7 \u2192 negative \u2192 no real roots. So D is incorrect.\n\nOption B)7: D=25-28= -3 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nOption A)9: 25-36= -11 \u2192 no.\n\nOption E)12: 25-48= -23 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C)3: D=25-12=13 \u2192 positive \u2192 real and distinct roots.\n\nSo the largest k in the options that gives a positive discriminant is 3, but that's the smallest option. So that can't be right. Wait, that's confusing. So according to this, none of the options except C)3 give a positive discriminant. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to find the largest k such that the equation has two real roots, not necessarily distinct. So discriminant >=0.\n\nSo for discriminant >=0, 25-4k >=0 \u2192k <=6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But again, not an option. So perhaps the question is incorrect, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me recheck. Discriminant D= b\u00b2-4ac. Here, a=1, b=-5, c=k.\n\nSo D= (-5)^2 -4(1)(k) =25 -4k.\n\nYes, correct. So 25-4k>0 \u2192k<6.25.\n\nWait, perhaps the options were given incorrectly. But assuming the options are correct, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think differently. Maybe the quadratic equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and I need to find the maximum k where the equation has two real roots. So maximum k is 6.25. So the largest integer less than that is 6. But since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is not present. But that can't be right because the options are given.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the largest integer k where the equation has at least two real roots, regardless of whether they are distinct. So discriminant >=0, so k<=6.25. So maximum integer is 6. Again, not in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the equation. Could it be x\u00b2 +5x +k=0? No, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the integral values of k for which the equation has two real roots. But the options given don't have 6, so perhaps the correct answer is 6, but it's not listed. But that can't be, so perhaps I need to reevaluate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the maximum k where the equation has two real roots, regardless of whether they are distinct, and then pick the largest option that's <=6.25. Looking at the options, the largest option that's less than 6.25 is 3 (option C). But that's the smallest option, which can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but perhaps I'm supposed to find k such that the equation has two real roots, but perhaps I have a different setup. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, and I'm looking for the maximum k where the equation has two real roots. So that's 6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But no option is 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not about the discriminant but something else, but I can't think of any other way. Maybe the problem is mistyped.\n\nWait, perhaps the quadratic is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me try that. Then a=1, b=5, c=k. D=25-4k. Same condition as before. So same result: k must be <6.25. So same issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5k x +k=0. No, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the correct answer should be 6, but it's not among the options. So perhaps the options are wrong, or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the discriminant for each option.\n\nOption D)k=8: D=25 -4*8=25-32= -7 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nOption B)k=7: D=25-28= -3 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nOption A)k=9: 25-36= -11 \u2192 no.\n\nOption E)k=12: 25-48= -23 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C)k=3: D=25-12=13>0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo only option C)3 gives a positive discriminant. So the largest k among the options that works is 3. But that's the smallest option. So perhaps the correct answer is 6, but since it's not an option, the next best thing is 3. But that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me read the question again.\n\nQuestion: What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 will have two real and distinct roots?\n\nOptions: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nHmm. I think I'm confident in my calculations, so perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's not possible. So perhaps I need to reevaluate.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps I misapplied the discriminant condition. Wait, for two real and distinct roots, D must be positive. So if k=6, D=25-24=1>0. So that's good. So 6 is the maximum. But since it's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is 6, but since it's not present, perhaps the question is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should choose the largest k that's less than 6.25 among the options. So the options are 3,7,8,9,12. The largest less than 6.25 is 3. So option C)3. But that seems odd because 3 is the smallest option. So perhaps the correct answer is 3.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because 3 is way below 6.25. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I have to choose from the given ones. So the only option that satisfies D>0 is 3. So the largest k in the options that works is 3, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, that seems incorrect because 3 is much smaller than 6.25. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the largest k such that the equation has two real roots, regardless of being distinct. So D >=0 \u2192 k <=6.25. So the largest k in the options less than or equal to 6.25 is 3. But that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something about the problem. Let me think again: the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the largest k where the equation has two real roots, and perhaps the roots are integers. But that's a different condition. But the question doesn't state that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the integral values of k that make the equation have real roots, and the largest such k is 6.25, so the largest integer is 6. But again, 6 is not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and the correct answer is 3, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me check again.\n\nThe equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4(1)(k) =25-4k.\n\nFor two real and distinct roots, D>0 \u219225-4k>0 \u21924k<25 \u2192k<6.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer k is 6.\n\nBut none of the options have 6. So perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but the closest lower option is 3.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the options are wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are correct, but I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute for k=7.\n\nk=7: D=25-28= -3 \u2192 negative. So no real roots.\n\nk=8: D=25-32= -7 \u2192 negative.\n\nk=3: D=13 \u2192 positive.\n\nSo the only option that works is 3.\n\nSo the largest integral value in the options that satisfies the condition is 3, option C.\n\nBut that seems odd because 3 is the smallest option. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but I have to choose the best available, which is 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as x\u00b2 +5x +k=0, but then the discriminant would be 25-4k, same as before.\n\nWait, but the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct answer should be 6, but since it's not present, the only option that works is 3. So perhaps the correct answer is C)3.\n",

So the same reasoning applies: k must be \u22646.25. So 6 is the largest integer. But that's not an option. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I read the problem wrong. Let me read it again: the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 will have two real and distinct roots. So the discriminant must be positive. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 k<6.25.\n\nSo the largest integer k is 6. But in the options, the maximum is 12. So perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake elsewhere.\n\nWait another approach: perhaps the problem is written as x\u00b2 -5k x + something else, but no, the problem says x\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the quadratic equation in terms of x and k, but that doesn't make sense because k is a constant here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not correctly stated, or perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant. Let me try plugging each option into the discriminant.\n\nLet's try option D)8.\n\nk=8: discriminant is 25-32= -7 \u2192 negative \u2192 no real roots. So D is incorrect.\n\nOption B)7: D=25-28= -3 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nOption A)9: 25-36= -11 \u2192 no.\n\nOption E)12: 25-48= -23 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C)3: D=25-12=13 \u2192 positive \u2192 real and distinct roots.\n\nSo the largest k in the options that gives a positive discriminant is 3, but that's the smallest option. So that can't be right. Wait, that's confusing. So according to this, none of the options except C)3 give a positive discriminant. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to find the largest k such that the equation has two real roots, not necessarily distinct. So discriminant >=0.\n\nSo for discriminant >=0, 25-4k >=0 \u2192k <=6.25. So the maximum integer is 6. But again, not an option. So perhaps the question is incorrect, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me recheck. Discriminant D= b\u00b2-4ac. Here, a=1, b=-5, c=k.\n\nSo D= (-5)^2 -4(1)(k) =25 -4k.\n\nYes, correct. So 25-4k>0 \u2192k<6.25.\n\nWait, perhaps the options were given incorrectly. But assuming the options are correct, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think differently. Maybe the quadratic equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, and I need to find the maximum k where the equation has two real roots. So maximum k is 6.25. So the largest integer less than that is 6. But since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is not present. But that can't be right because the options are given.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the largest integer k where the equation has at least two real roots, regardless of whether they are distinct. So discriminant >=0, so k<=6.25. So maximum integer is 6. Again, not in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the equation. Could it be x\u00b2 +5x +k=0? No, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the integral values of k for which the equation has two real roots. But the options given don't have 6, so perhaps the correct answer is 6, but it's not listed. But that can't be, so perhaps I need to reevaluate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the maximum k where the equation has two real roots, regardless of whether they are distinct, and then pick the largest option that's <=6.25. Looking at the options, the largest option that's less than 6.25 is 3 (option C). But that's the smallest option, which can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, but perhaps I'm supposed to find k such that the equation has two real roots, but perhaps I have a different setup. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, and I'm looking for the maximum k where the equation has two real roots. So that's 6.25. So the largest integer is 6. But no option is 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not about the discriminant but something else, but I can't think of any other way. Maybe the problem is mistyped.\n\nWait, perhaps the quadratic is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Let me try that. Then a=1, b=5, c=k. D=25-4k. Same condition as before. So same result: k must be <6.25. So same issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5k x +k=0. No, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the correct answer should be 6, but it's not among the options. So perhaps the options are wrong, or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the discriminant for each option.\n\nOption D)k=8: D=25 -4*8=25-32= -7 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nOption B)k=7: D=25-28= -3 <0 \u2192 no real roots.\n\nOption A)k=9: 25-36= -11 \u2192 no.\n\nOption E)k=12: 25-48= -23 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C)k=3: D=25-12=13>0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo only option C)3 gives a positive discriminant. So the largest k among the options that works is 3. But that's the smallest option. So perhaps the correct answer is 6, but since it's not an option, the next best thing is 3. But that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me read the question again.\n\nQuestion: What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 will have two real and distinct roots?\n\nOptions: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12.\n\nHmm. I think I'm confident in my calculations, so perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's not possible. So perhaps I need to reevaluate.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps I misapplied the discriminant condition. Wait, for two real and distinct roots, D must be positive. So if k=6, D=25-24=1>0. So that's good. So 6 is the maximum. But since it's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is 6, but since it's not present, perhaps the question is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should choose the largest k that's less than 6.25 among the options. So the options are 3,7,8,9,12. The largest less than 6.25 is 3. So option C)3. But that seems odd because 3 is the smallest option. So perhaps the correct answer is 3.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because 3 is way below 6.25. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I have to choose from the given ones. So the only option that satisfies D>0 is 3. So the largest k in the options that works is 3, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, that seems incorrect because 3 is much smaller than 6.25. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the largest k such that the equation has two real roots, regardless of being distinct. So D >=0 \u2192 k <=6.25. So the largest k in the options less than or equal to 6.25 is 3. But that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something about the problem. Let me think again: the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the largest k where the equation has two real roots, and perhaps the roots are integers. But that's a different condition. But the question doesn't state that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the integral values of k that make the equation have real roots, and the largest such k is 6.25, so the largest integer is 6. But again, 6 is not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and the correct answer is 3, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me check again.\n\nThe equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-5)^2 -4(1)(k) =25-4k.\n\nFor two real and distinct roots, D>0 \u219225-4k>0 \u21924k<25 \u2192k<6.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer k is 6.\n\nBut none of the options have 6. So perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but the closest lower option is 3.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the options are wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are correct, but I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute for k=7.\n\nk=7: D=25-28= -3 \u2192 negative. So no real roots.\n\nk=8: D=25-32= -7 \u2192 negative.\n\nk=3: D=13 \u2192 positive.\n\nSo the only option that works is 3.\n\nSo the largest integral value in the options that satisfies the condition is 3, option C.\n\nBut that seems odd because 3 is the smallest option. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but I have to choose the best available, which is 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as x\u00b2 +5x +k=0, but then the discriminant would be 25-4k, same as before.\n\nWait, but the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct answer should be 6, but since it's not present, the only option that works is 3. So perhaps the correct answer is C)3.\n\n\nTo determine the largest integral value of \\( k \\) for which the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\) has two real and distinct roots, we analyze the discriminant of the quadratic equation.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation problem here. The question is asking for the largest integer value of 'k' such that the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 has two real and distinct roots. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quadratics, but I'll try to work through it.\n\nWait, right, for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant is b\u00b2 - 4ac. The discriminant tells us about the nature of the roots. If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, the roots are equal (so technically one real root with multiplicity two), and if it's negative, the roots are complex or imaginary.\n\nSo the equation here is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Comparing this to the standard form, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. So the discriminant D would be (-5)\u00b2 - 4*1*k. Let me compute that: 25 -4k.\n\nWe need two distinct real roots, so the discriminant must be greater than zero. So 25 -4k > 0. Let me solve for k.\n\n25 -4k > 0 \u2192 subtract 25 from both sides: -4k > -25. Now, when I divide both sides by a negative number, I have to reverse the inequality sign. So dividing by -4 gives: k < 25/4.\n\n25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k has to be less than 6.25. But the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 6. The options are 9,7,3,8,12. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. Discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac. So b is -5, so b\u00b2 is 25. 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So D=25-4k. For two real and distinct roots, D>0 \u2192 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k<25/4 \u2192 25/4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6, but none of the options are 6.\n\nWait, maybe I did something wrong here. Let me look at the options again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Oh wait, perhaps I messed up the discriminant sign. Let me see again. Oh wait, wait, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25-4k. Right, that's correct.\n\nSo if k must be less than 6.25, but the options don't include 6. So maybe I'm looking at the wrong condition. Wait, is the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k or something else? No, the question says x\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check. The question says two real and distinct roots. So yes, discriminant must be positive.\n\nHmm, so the options don't have 6. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k, but no, the question says x\u00b2-5x. So I'm confident in my discriminant.\n\nWait, looking at the options again, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. All of these are larger than 6.25 except maybe some. Wait, 3 is less than 6.25, 7 is more, 8 is more, 9 is more, 12 is more. So in that case, the only option less than 6.25 is C)3. But 3 is way lower than 6.25. So that would be the only option that satisfies k<6.25. But the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So 3 is the only one that's allowed, but that can't be right because 3 is smaller than 6.25, but maybe I've made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the inequality. Let me go through it again.\n\nDiscriminant D must be greater than 0:\n\n25 -4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k < 25/4 \u2192 25/4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer value would be 6, but that's not an option. So the options given don't have 6, so perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. The question says \"integral\" value, so it's an integer. Let me check the options again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So none of these are less than 6.25 except C)3. So the largest possible integer less than 6.25 is 6, but it's not an option. So maybe I made a mistake in the discriminant.\n\nWait, could I have messed up the signs? Let's double-check the equation. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac \u2192 (-5)^2 -4*1*k \u2192 25-4k. Correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Wait, the problem says \"two real and distinct roots.\" So perhaps I should have k as large as possible but less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Or maybe the question is for two real and equal roots, but no, the question is about two distinct roots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the discriminant. Wait, no, that's correct. So maybe the options are wrong, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0, but no, the question says x\u00b2-5x +k. So I'm confident in that.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is looking for the maximum value of k such that the equation has two real and distinct roots, which would be just below 6.25. So the maximum integer is 6, but since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is not present. But that can't be right, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I misapplied the discriminant. Let me think again. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) =25-4k. For two distinct real roots, 25-4k>0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 k<25/4 \u2192 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6. So among the options, the closest is 3, but that's way lower. Alternatively, perhaps the options are incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read it again. The question is correct, right? So perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the equation is written differently. Let me check: x squared minus 5x plus k equals zero. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So all are higher than 6.25 except 3.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I miscalculated the discriminant. Let me try another approach. Suppose k is 7, which is option B. Then the discriminant would be 25 -4*7 =25-28 =-3. That's negative, which means no real roots. So 7 is too big.\n\nIf k is 8, D=25-32=-7. Also negative.\n\nk=9: D=25-36=-11. Negative.\n\nk=12: D=25-48=-23. Negative.\n\nk=3: D=25-12=13>0. So that would give two real roots.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the largest integral k. So if all the options except 3 are too big, then 3 is the only possible correct answer. But 3 is option C. So the answer would be C)3.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because 3 is the smallest option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I've confused the equation. Let me think: if the equation were x\u00b2 +5x +k=0, then discriminant would be 25-4k, same as before. So same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x -k=0, which would change the discriminant. Wait, no, the question says x\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is to find the largest k for which there are real roots, but two distinct ones. So the maximum k is 6.25, so the largest integer is 6, but 6 isn't an option. So the correct answer isn't among the options. But that can't be the case because the options must include the correct answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the discriminant. Let me check another way.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So the discriminant is 25-4k. For two distinct real roots, 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k<25 \u2192k<6.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer less than 6.25 is 6. So the correct answer is 6, but that's not among the options. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not present. But that can't be right because the options are given.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem. Let me check the problem again. It says 'integral value of k' so an integer. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So all are higher than 6.25 except C)3.\n\nSo if the options are correct, the only possible answer is C)3. Because 3 is less than 6.25, but all others are higher. So the largest possible k in the options that is less than 6.25 is 3. But that seems odd because 3 is much smaller than 6.25. So why would the options not include 6, 5, etc.?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the smallest possible k, not the largest? No, the question is definitely asking for the largest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should plug in the options into the discriminant and see which is the largest k that still gives a positive discriminant.\n\nLet's try each option:\n\nOption A)9: D=25-4*9=25-36= -11. Negative. So no real roots.\n\nOption B)7: D=25-28= -3. Negative.\n\nOption C)3: D=25-12=13>0. Positive. So real roots.\n\nOption D)8: D=25-32=-7. Negative.\n\nOption E)12: D=25-48=-23. Negative.\n\nSo the only option that gives a positive discriminant is C)3. So the largest possible k in the options that allows two real and distinct roots is 3. So the answer is C)3.\n",

So dividing by -4 gives: k < 25/4.\n\n25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k has to be less than 6.25. But the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 6. The options are 9,7,3,8,12. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. Discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac. So b is -5, so b\u00b2 is 25. 4ac is 4*1*k=4k. So D=25-4k. For two real and distinct roots, D>0 \u2192 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k<25/4 \u2192 25/4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6, but none of the options are 6.\n\nWait, maybe I did something wrong here. Let me look at the options again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Oh wait, perhaps I messed up the discriminant sign. Let me see again. Oh wait, wait, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*1*k =25-4k. Right, that's correct.\n\nSo if k must be less than 6.25, but the options don't include 6. So maybe I'm looking at the wrong condition. Wait, is the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k or something else? No, the question says x\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check. The question says two real and distinct roots. So yes, discriminant must be positive.\n\nHmm, so the options don't have 6. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k, but no, the question says x\u00b2-5x. So I'm confident in my discriminant.\n\nWait, looking at the options again, the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. All of these are larger than 6.25 except maybe some. Wait, 3 is less than 6.25, 7 is more, 8 is more, 9 is more, 12 is more. So in that case, the only option less than 6.25 is C)3. But 3 is way lower than 6.25. So that would be the only option that satisfies k<6.25. But the question is asking for the largest integral value of k. So 3 is the only one that's allowed, but that can't be right because 3 is smaller than 6.25, but maybe I've made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the inequality. Let me go through it again.\n\nDiscriminant D must be greater than 0:\n\n25 -4k >0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k < 25/4 \u2192 25/4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer value would be 6, but that's not an option. So the options given don't have 6, so perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. The question says \"integral\" value, so it's an integer. Let me check the options again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So none of these are less than 6.25 except C)3. So the largest possible integer less than 6.25 is 6, but it's not an option. So maybe I made a mistake in the discriminant.\n\nWait, could I have messed up the signs? Let's double-check the equation. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac \u2192 (-5)^2 -4*1*k \u2192 25-4k. Correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Wait, the problem says \"two real and distinct roots.\" So perhaps I should have k as large as possible but less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6, but it's not an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Or maybe the question is for two real and equal roots, but no, the question is about two distinct roots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the discriminant. Wait, no, that's correct. So maybe the options are wrong, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0, but no, the question says x\u00b2-5x +k. So I'm confident in that.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is looking for the maximum value of k such that the equation has two real and distinct roots, which would be just below 6.25. So the maximum integer is 6, but since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is not present. But that can't be right, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I misapplied the discriminant. Let me think again. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) =25-4k. For two distinct real roots, 25-4k>0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 k<25/4 \u2192 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. So the largest integer is 6. So among the options, the closest is 3, but that's way lower. Alternatively, perhaps the options are incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read it again. The question is correct, right? So perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the equation is written differently. Let me check: x squared minus 5x plus k equals zero. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So all are higher than 6.25 except 3.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I miscalculated the discriminant. Let me try another approach. Suppose k is 7, which is option B. Then the discriminant would be 25 -4*7 =25-28 =-3. That's negative, which means no real roots. So 7 is too big.\n\nIf k is 8, D=25-32=-7. Also negative.\n\nk=9: D=25-36=-11. Negative.\n\nk=12: D=25-48=-23. Negative.\n\nk=3: D=25-12=13>0. So that would give two real roots.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the largest integral k. So if all the options except 3 are too big, then 3 is the only possible correct answer. But 3 is option C. So the answer would be C)3.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because 3 is the smallest option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I've confused the equation. Let me think: if the equation were x\u00b2 +5x +k=0, then discriminant would be 25-4k, same as before. So same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x -k=0, which would change the discriminant. Wait, no, the question says x\u00b2 -5x +k=0.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is to find the largest k for which there are real roots, but two distinct ones. So the maximum k is 6.25, so the largest integer is 6, but 6 isn't an option. So the correct answer isn't among the options. But that can't be the case because the options must include the correct answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the discriminant. Let me check another way.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So the discriminant is 25-4k. For two distinct real roots, 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k<25 \u2192k<6.25.\n\nSo the maximum integer less than 6.25 is 6. So the correct answer is 6, but that's not among the options. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not present. But that can't be right because the options are given.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem. Let me check the problem again. It says 'integral value of k' so an integer. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. So all are higher than 6.25 except C)3.\n\nSo if the options are correct, the only possible answer is C)3. Because 3 is less than 6.25, but all others are higher. So the largest possible k in the options that is less than 6.25 is 3. But that seems odd because 3 is much smaller than 6.25. So why would the options not include 6, 5, etc.?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the smallest possible k, not the largest? No, the question is definitely asking for the largest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should plug in the options into the discriminant and see which is the largest k that still gives a positive discriminant.\n\nLet's try each option:\n\nOption A)9: D=25-4*9=25-36= -11. Negative. So no real roots.\n\nOption B)7: D=25-28= -3. Negative.\n\nOption C)3: D=25-12=13>0. Positive. So real roots.\n\nOption D)8: D=25-32=-7. Negative.\n\nOption E)12: D=25-48=-23. Negative.\n\nSo the only option that gives a positive discriminant is C)3. So the largest possible k in the options that allows two real and distinct roots is 3. So the answer is C)3.\n\n\nTo determine the largest integral value of \\( k \\) for which the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\) has two real and distinct roots, we analyze the discriminant of the quadratic equation. For a general quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant is given by:\n\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\nFor the equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\), the coefficients are \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -5 \\), and \\( c = k \\). Substituting these values into the discriminant formula:\n\n\\[\nD = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k\n\\]\n\nFor the equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive:\n\n\\[\n25 - 4k > 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\n25 > 4k \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k < \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( k \\) must be less than \\( 6.25 \\). The largest integer less than \\( 6.25 \\) is \\( 6 \\). However, \\( 6 \\) is not among the provided options. To verify, we evaluate the discriminant for each option:\n\n- **Option A (\\( k = 9 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(9) = 25 - 36 = -11 \\) (negative, no real roots).\n- **Option B (\\( k = 7 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(7) = 25 - 28 = -3 \\) (negative, no real roots).\n- **Option C (\\( k = 3 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(3) = 25 - 12 = 13 \\) (positive, two real roots).\n- **Option D (\\( k = 8 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(8) = 25 - 32 = -7 \\) (negative, no real roots).\n- **Option E (\\( k = 12 \\))**: \\( D = 25 - 4(12) = 25 - 48 = -23 \\) (negative, no real roots).\n\nAmong the options, only \\( k = 3 \\) yields a positive discriminant, ensuring two real and distinct roots. Therefore, the largest integral value of \\( k \\) that satisfies the condition is:\n\n**Answer: C**",
