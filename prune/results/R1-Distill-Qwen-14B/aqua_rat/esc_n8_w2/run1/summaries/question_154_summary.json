      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two ants and their shadows. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on similar triangles and proportions, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nAlright, the problem says that two ants are standing side by side. The first ant is 4 inches tall, and its shadow is 10 inches long. The second ant is 6 inches tall, and we need to find the length of its shadow.\n\nWait, so I remember that when objects cast shadows, the ratio of their heights to their shadow lengths is the same if the light source is at the same angle. Oh right, similar triangles! So the triangles formed by the ants and their shadows are similar because the light is coming from the same direction. That makes the ratios equal.\n\nSo, let me set up the ratio. For the first ant, height over shadow length is 4 inches over 10 inches. For the second ant, the ratio would be 6 inches over the unknown shadow length, which I'll call S.\n\nSo the equation should be 4/10 = 6/S. Wait, no, wait. Wait, similar triangles have proportional sides, so the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. So the ratio of height to shadow for the first ant is the same as that for the second ant.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Is it height divided by shadow length for both, or is it the other way around? Oh, right, because if the sun is higher (lower shadow length), the object is shorter. So the taller object would have a longer shadow only if the sun is lower, but in this case, the first ant is shorter but has a longer shadow. Wait, no, the first ant is 4 inches tall, casting a 10-inch shadow. The second is 6 inches tall, which is taller. So if the sun's angle is the same, a taller object would cast a longer shadow.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think about the ratios. So for the first ant, height is 4, shadow is 10. So 4/10 is 0.4. The second ant is 6, so if the ratio is the same, then 6/S = 4/10. So solving for S would give S = (6 * 10)/4 = 60/4 = 15. So S is 15 inches? Wait, but wait, that would mean the taller ant has a longer shadow, which makes sense because it's taller and the same sun angle. So that's probably right.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should set up the proportion as height to shadow as 4:10, and 6:S. So 4/10 = 6/S. Cross-multiplying gives 4S = 60, so S=15. That's what I thought.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 15. So the answer should be D.\n",

Let me try to break it down.\n\nSo, the first ant is 4 inches tall and casts a shadow that's 10 inches long. The second ant is taller, 6 inches. I need to find out how long its shadow is.\n\nWait, right. When objects are casting shadows under the same light source, the triangles formed by the objects and their shadows are similar. So the ratios of their heights to the lengths of their shadows should be the same.\n\nSo for the first ant, the ratio is height divided by shadow length. That would be 4 inches divided by 10 inches. Let me write that as 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5. So the ratio is 2:5.\n\nSince the light source is the same, the angle of the light is the same for both ants. That means the second ant's height to shadow length ratio should be the same 2:5.\n\nThe second ant is 6 inches tall. So if I let x be the length of its shadow, then 6/x should equal 2/5.\n\nSo setting up the equation: 6/x = 2/5. To solve for x, I can cross-multiply. 2 times x equals 5 times 6. That gives 2x=30. Dividing both sides by 2, x=15.\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Looking back, option D is 15. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because the taller ant should cast a longer shadow, right? Because if the first ant is 4 inches and has a 10-inch shadow, a taller ant should have a longer shadow than 10 inches. But 15 is longer than 10, so that makes sense.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check the ratios. The first ant is 4 inches tall, shadow 10 inches. So the shadow is longer than the height. So the ratio of height to shadow is 4:10, which is 2:5. So for the second ant, 6 inches, the shadow would be (6 *5)/2. Let me compute that: 6 times 5 is 30, divided by 2 is 15. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the shadow length for the taller ant is 15 inches.
