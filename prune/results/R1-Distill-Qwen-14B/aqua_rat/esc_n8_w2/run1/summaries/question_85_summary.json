      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about the length of a ribbon. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the original length is 30 cm, and it was reduced in the ratio 5:3. Wait, what does that mean exactly?\n\nI remember that when something is reduced in a ratio, it's like scaling down. So the original is compared to the new length. Oh right, ratios compare two quantities. So the original length is 5 parts, and the new length is 3 parts. \n\nWait, let me think. If the ratio is 5:3, that means the original is 5 and the new is 3. So I can set up a proportion. Let me write that down.\n\nOriginal : Reduced = 5 : 3\n\nSo 5 corresponds to the original length, which is 30 cm. And 3 corresponds to the new length, which I need to find. Let's call the new length x.\n\nSo 5/3 = 30/x. Wait, is that right? Or should it be 5:3 as original to new, so 5 parts to 3 parts. Oh wait, no, that's not the way to set it up. Maybe it's better to think in terms of fractions.\n\nThe ratio 5:3 is the same as 5/3. So the new length is (3/5) of the original. Because if you think about it, the original is 5 units, and the reduced is 3 units. So each unit is 30 divided by 5. Oh wait, yeah, that's another approach.\n\nSo, 30 cm is the original, which is 5 units. So each unit is 30 /5 = 6 cm. Then the new length is 3 units, which is 3 *6 =18 cm. So the answer should be 18 cm, which is option A.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. If it's reduced in the ratio 5:3, does that mean the new length is 3/5 of the original? Because sometimes ratios can be a bit tricky. Let me think about the wording. It says \"reduced in the ratio 5:3.\" So the original was 5 and now it's 3, so the new is smaller. So yes, 3 is less than 5, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using proportions: 5/3 = 30/x. Wait, no, that's not right. Because if 5 corresponds to 30, then 3 would correspond to x. So 5 parts =30 cm, so 1 part is 6 cm. Then 3 parts is 18 cm. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo the correct answer should be A) 18.\n",

So if something is reduced in the ratio 5:3, does that mean the original is 5 parts and the new is 3 parts? Or is it the other way around?
