      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that when 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number N, they leave the same remainder. I need to find the sum of the digits of N, and the options are from A to E.\n\nHmm, I remember that if two numbers leave the same remainder when divided by a divisor, then their difference should be divisible by that divisor. So maybe I should subtract 875 from 2272. Let me calculate that.\n\n2272 minus 875. Let's see, 2272 - 800 is 1472, then minus 75 is 1397. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 875 is 800+75, so 2272 - 800 is 1472, then 1472 minus 75 is 1397? Or did I make a mistake there. Wait, 1472 minus 70 is 1402, then minus 5 is 1397. Yeah, that's right. So the difference is 1397.\n\nSo this means that N must be a divisor of 1397. Because when you subtract the two original numbers, the remainder cancels out, leaving a multiple of N. So N is a 3-digit number that divides 1397.\n\nNow, I need to find all the divisors of 1397 and see which ones are 3-digit numbers. Then, among those, find the sum of their digits.\n\nWait, but how do I find the divisors of 1397? Maybe I should factorize 1397.\n\nLet me try dividing 1397 by some primes. Let's see, 1397 divided by 2? No, it's odd. Divided by 3: 1+3+9+7 = 20, which isn't divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 7, so no. 7? Let's try 1397 \u00f77. 7 into 1397: 7*199 is 1393, so 1397 minus 1393 is 4. So remainder 4, so not divisible by 7.\n\nNext prime is 11. Let's do the 11 test. The alternating sum: (1 +9) - (3 +7) = (10) - (10) = 0. Oh, so it's divisible by 11. Because the alternating sum is a multiple of 11.\n\nSo 1397 \u00f711 is... Let me compute. 11 times 127 is 1397? Wait, 11*120 is 1320. 1320 + 77 is 1397 because 11*7=77. So 120+7=127. So 11*127 = 1397.\n\nSo the factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, and 1397. Wait, but 127 is a prime number because I don't think it's divisible by any primes up to its square root (which is around 11. So 127 \u00f72 no, 3 no, 5 no, 7 no, 11? 11*11 is 121, 127-121=6, not divisible. So 127 is prime.\n\nSo the factors are 1, 11, 127, and 1397.\n\nBut wait, N is a 3-digit number. So from the factors, which ones are 3-digit? Let's see: 11 is 2-digit, 127 is 3-digit, and 1397 is 4-digit. So the only 3-digit factor is 127. So N must be 127.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because N has to be a 3-digit number. So 127 is a candidate.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because when you divide 2272 by N, the remainder is same as when you divide 875 by N. So let's make sure that 127 is indeed the correct N.\n\nLet me compute 2272 \u00f7127. Let's see, 127*17 is 2159. Because 127*10=1270, 127*7=889; 1270+889=2159. Then 2272 -2159=113. So the remainder is 113.\n\nNow, 875 \u00f7127. Let's calculate: 127*6=762. 875-762=113. So the remainder is also 113. So yes, N=127 works.\n\nSo N is 127. Now, the sum of its digits is 1+2+7=10. Wait, but 1+2+7 is 10? That's option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other possible 3-digit divisors. Because sometimes, the difference might have other factors. Let me see. The factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, 1397. So the only 3-digit factor is 127. So N is 127.\n\nSo the sum of its digits is 1+2+7=10. But wait, looking at the options, option A is 10. So the answer would be A)10.\n\nWait a second, but wait another thing. The problem says that N is a 3-digit number, so 127 is 3-digit. Are there any other possible factors? Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps 1397 can be divided by another 3-digit number. Let me see. Let's see, 1397 divided by 127 is 11. So the factors are 11 and 127, and then 1 and 1397. So no other 3-digit factors exist. So N must be 127.\n\nSo sum of digits is 1+2+7=10, which is option A.\n",

So let me write that down.\n\nSo, 2272 minus 875 should be equal to some multiple of N. Let me calculate that: 2272 - 875.

So 1397 minus 1393 is 4. So remainder 4. So 7 doesn't divide 1397.\n\nHow about 11? Let's apply the divisibility rule for 11: subtract and add digits alternately. So (1 - 3 + 9 -7) = (1-3)= -2, (9-7)=2. So -2 +2 =0. Oh, that's divisible by 11. So 1397 is divisible by 11. Let me do the division: 1397 \u00f7 11.\n\n11 times 127 is 1397?

So yes, both have the same remainder of 113 when divided by 127. So N is 127.\n\nSo the sum of the digits of N is 1 + 2 +7=10. Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 10, B is 11, etc. So the answer should be A)10.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. Let me think again. Are there any other 3-digit factors of 1397 that I might have missed?\n\nWait, 1397 is 11 *127, and both 11 and 127 are primes. So the only possible factors are 1,11,127,1397. So N has to be 127, as it's the only 3-digit factor.\n\nSo the sum of its digits is 1+2+7=10. So the answer is A)10.\n\n\nWhen 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number \\( N \\), they leave the same remainder. This implies that the difference between the two numbers, \\( 2272 - 875 = 1397 \\), is divisible by \\( N \\). Therefore, \\( N \\) must be a 3-digit divisor of 1397.\n\nTo factorize 1397, we check for divisibility by small primes. It is divisible by 11 (using the alternating sum rule: \\( 1 - 3 + 9 - 7 = 0 \\)), and dividing \\( 1397 \\) by 11 gives \\( 127 \\). Since 127 is a prime number, the factors of 1397 are \\( 1, 11, 127, \\) and \\( 1397 \\).\n\nAmong these, the only 3-digit factor is \\( 127 \\). Thus, \\( N = 127 \\). The sum of the digits of \\( N \\) is \\( 1 + 2 + 7 = 10 \\).\n\nTo confirm, dividing \\( 2272 \\) and \\( 875 \\) by \\( 127 \\) both leave a remainder of \\( 113 \\), verifying that \\( N = 127 \\) is correct. Therefore, the sum of the digits of \\( N \\) is \\( 10 \\).\n\nAnswer: A",
