      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nSo, the company produces pens. On average, 10% are defective and get rejected. So, that means for every 100 pens they make, 10 are thrown away, and 90 are good. Right, so the company only sells the non-defective ones.\n\nThey promise to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler. Each pen is sold at Rs. 10. So, the total revenue would be 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72,000.\n\nWait, but the company has a profit of 25% on all the manufactured pens. Hmm, okay. So, their profit is 25% on the total cost of manufacturing. So, the selling price is higher than the cost by 25%.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. The profit is calculated on the cost. So, if their cost is C, then the selling price (SP) is C plus 25% of C. Or SP = C * 1.25. Or, the other way around, profit is 25%, so SP = (100% + 25%) * C = 125% of C.\n\nBut wait, the company sells the pens, but they had to make more than 7200 because 10% are defective. So, the 7200 is after rejecting 10%. Let me find out how many pens they actually produced.\n\nSo, if 10% are defective, then 90% are good. Let me let the total produced be X. So, 90% of X is 7200. Because they only deliver 7200 good pens.\n\nSo, 0.9X = 7200. Therefore, X = 7200 / 0.9 = 8000. Oh, right, so they made 8000 pens in total, but 10% (800) are defective, so only 7200 are sold.\n\nNow, the revenue is 7200 * 10 = 72,000 Rs.\n\nThe company's profit is 25% on all the manufactured pens. So, their profit is 25% of the total cost. Let me denote the total cost as T. Then, the selling price would be T + 25% of T = 1.25 T.\n\nBut wait, the selling price is the money they get from selling the pens, which is 72,000 Rs. So, 1.25 T = 72,000. So, T = 72,000 / 1.25.\n\nLet me calculate that. 72,000 divided by 1.25. Hmm, 1.25 is 5/4, so dividing by 5/4 is same as multiplying by 4/5. So, 72,000 * (4/5) = (72,000 /5) *4. 72,000 divided by 5 is 14,400. Multiply by 4 gives 57,600. So, total cost T is Rs. 57,600.\n\nWait, but wait. Is that correct? Because the total cost is the cost for all 8000 pens, right? So, the cost per pen would be T divided by X, which is 57,600 /8000.\n\nLet me calculate that: 57,600 divided by 8000. Hmm, 8000 goes into 57,600 how many times? 57,600 /8000 = 7.2. So, Rs.7.2 per pen.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. So, the total cost is for 8000 pens. Their selling price is based on 7200 pens. The revenue is 72,000, which is 125% of the total cost. So, the total cost is 72,000 /1.25 =57,600. So yes, per pen cost is 57600 /8000=7.2. So each pen's cost is Rs7.2.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is Rs7.2. So the answer should be B.\n",

They deliver 7200 pens to a wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. Their overall profit is estimated to be 25%. I need to find the manufactured cost of each pen.\n\nWait, wait. Let me break it down step by step. So, first, the company sells 7200 pens. But wait, these are the pens that are delivered, which are the non-defective ones because 10% are rejected. So the total number of pens they actually make is more than 7200.\n\nRight, because 10% are defective. So if they ended up selling 7200, that means these are 90% of the total produced. Because 10% are rejected. So let me think. Let's call the total produced pens as N. So 90% of N is 7200. So N = 7200 / 0.9. Let me calculate that.\n\n7200 divided by 0.9 is the same as 7200 * (10/9) which is 8000. Oh wait, 7200 divided by 0.9 is 8000. Because 0.9 * 8000 = 7200. Yeah, that makes sense. So the company made 8000 pens, but 10% (800) were defective and thus rejected. So they sold 7200 pens.\n\nThey sold each pen for Rs. 10. So their revenue is 7200 * 10. Let me compute that. 7200 * 10 is 72,000 Rs.\n\nNow, the company's overall profit is 25%. Hmm, wait. The problem says the overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%. So their profit is based on the total cost of manufacturing all 8000 pens.\n\nSo, the profit is 25% of the cost. So their selling price must be 125% of the cost price, perhaps? Or wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of cost, profit, and selling price.\n\nLet me denote the cost price per pen as C. So the total cost for manufacturing 8000 pens is 8000 * C.\n\nTheir total revenue is 72,000 Rs, as calculated earlier.\n\nProfit is total revenue minus total cost. The profit is 25% of the total cost. So:\n\nProfit = 0.25 * (8000 * C)\n\nBut also, Profit = Revenue - Cost.\n\nSo:\n\nRevenue - Cost = 0.25 * Cost\n\nSo, Revenue = Cost + 0.25 * Cost = 1.25 * Cost.\n\nSo, Revenue = 1.25 * (8000 * C)\n\nWe know Revenue is 72,000. So:\n\n72,000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C)\n\nLet me compute 8000 * C first. 8000 * C is the total cost.\n\nSo 72,000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C)\n\nLet me solve for C.\n\nFirst, compute 8000 * C = 72,000 / 1.25\n\nLet me calculate 72,000 divided by 1.25.\n\nHmm, 1.25 is 5/4, so dividing by 5/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/5.\n\n72,000 * (4/5) = ?\n\nWait, 72,000 divided by 5 is 14,400. Then multiplied by 4 is 57,600.\n\nSo 8000 * C = 57,600.\n\nThen, C = 57,600 / 8000.\n\nCalculating that: 57,600 divided by 8000.\n\nWell, 8000 goes into 57,600 how many times?\n\n8000 *7=56,000. 57,600-56,000=1,600.\n\n8000 * 0.2 = 1,600.\n\nSo 7.2 times. So C is 7.2.\n\nWait, so the cost per pen is Rs.7.2.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 7.2. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Total pens produced: N = 7200 / 0.9 = 8000. Correct.\n\n2. Revenue from sales: 7200 *10 =72,000. Correct.\n\n3. Profit is 25% on total cost. So revenue = cost + 25% of cost = 1.25 * cost.\n\nSo, 72,000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C). Correct.\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC = 72,000 / (1.25 *8000) = 72,000 /10,000 =7.2. Wait, wait, because 1.25 *8000 is 10,000.\n\nWait, 1.25 *8000 = 8000 + (8000 *0.25) =8000 +2000=10,000.\n\nSo 72,000 /10,000 =7.2. So yes, correct.\n\nSo each pen's cost is 7.2.
