      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about figuring out the number of students in a class based on their interests in different sports. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nAlright, the question says that 8% of the total students are interested in Football. Then, 4/5 are interested in Cricket. Also, 10% like Basketball. The remaining students, which are 20, aren't interested in any of these games. I need to find the total number of students in the class.\n\nWait, so let's see. Let me denote the total number of students as N. Because percentages are involved, it's probably easier to work with N and then express each group as a fraction of N.\n\nSo, Football is 8% of N, which is 0.08N. Cricket is 4/5 of N, which is 0.8N. Basketball is 10% of N, so that's 0.10N. The remaining students are 20, so that's the leftover after accounting for all the sports interests.\n\nWait, but I should check if these percentages add up to less than 100% because the remaining are 20 students. Let me add up the percentages:\n\nFootball: 8%\nCricket: 4/5 is 80% (since 4/5 is 0.8)\nBasketball: 10%\nSo 8 + 80 +10 = 98%. Oh, so 98% are interested in at least one of these sports. That leaves 2% of the students uninterested, and that's given as 20 students.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So 2% of N equals 20. Because 100% -98% = 2%, and that 2% is 20 students.\n\nSo, mathematically, 2% of N is 20. So 0.02 * N = 20. To find N, divide both sides by 0.02.\n\nN = 20 / 0.02. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 0.02 is the same as 20 * 50, which is 1000. So N is 1000.\n\nLet me double-check the math. 2% is 20 students, so 1% is 10, so 100% is 1000. Yep, that's right.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if I accounted for all correctly. 8% Football, 80% Cricket, 10% Basketball. Wait, adding those up: 8+80=88, plus 10 is 98. So yes, 98% are interested in these, so 2% are not, which is 20 students.\n\nSo the total number of students is 1000. Looking at the options, E is 1000. So the answer should be E.\n",

I need to find the total number of students.\n\nWait, let's see. So, the percentages for each sport and the remaining 20 students. Maybe I can represent this with an equation. Let me denote the total number of students as N. Then, the number of students interested in Football is 8% of N, which is 0.08N. Similarly, Cricket has 4/5, which is 0.8N.
