      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about estimating the deer population in a forest. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I remember something about mark and recapture methods from biology class. \n\nSo, the problem says that in 2001, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and then released back into the forest. Then in 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, and out of those, 20 were found to have tags from the previous year. The question is asking for the total deer population in the forest, assuming that the percentage of tagged deer in the second year's sample is representative of the overall population. Also, the population hasn't changed between 2001 and 2002, which simplifies things a bit.\n\nHmm, right, this sounds like the Lincoln-Petersen index method for estimating animal populations. The basic idea is that the proportion of tagged animals in the second catch should be about the same as the proportion of tagged animals in the entire population. \n\nLet me write down what I know:\n\n- Number tagged in 2001 (let's call this M) = 300.\n- Total number caught in 2002 (let's call this C) = 500.\n- Number of tagged deer recaptured in 2002 (let's call this m) = 20.\n- The total population we need to find is N.\n\nThe formula, if I remember correctly, is N \u2248 (M * C) / m. Oh wait, but wait, that's when you have two captures. Alternatively, the proportion of tagged deer in the second sample should equal the proportion in the total population.\n\nSo, in the second sample, 20 out of 500 were tagged. That's 20/500, which is 0.04, or 4%. So that means that 4% of the entire population is estimated to be tagged. \n\nBut how many deer were tagged in total? Well, that's the 300 from 2001. So if 300 deer are 4% of the total population, then the total population N is 300 divided by 0.04.\n\nLet me do the math: 300 / 0.04 equals 7500. So the total population is 7500 deer. Looking at the options, option E is 7500. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. Sometimes I get confused between M and C. So the formula is N \u2248 (M * C) / m. Plugging in the numbers: (300 * 500) / 20. Let's calculate that. 300 times 500 is 150,000. Divided by 20 is 7500. Yep, that's the same answer. So that makes me more confident. \n\nI think the key here is understanding that the ratio of recaptured tagged deer to the total captured in the second sample should reflect the ratio of the total tagged deer to the total population. So the proportion m/C should equal M/N. Rearranging that gives N = (M * C) / m. \n\nAnother way to think about it: If 300 are tagged, and in the second sample, 20 are found, which is 4%, then the total population must be such that 300 is 4% of it. So 300 / 0.04 = 7500. \n\nI don't see any other factors here. The population hasn't changed, so the 300 tagged deer are still part of the same population in 2002. So I think E is the correct answer.\n",
