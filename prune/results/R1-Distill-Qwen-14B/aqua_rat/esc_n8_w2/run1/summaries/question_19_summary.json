      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the average score for a class after excluding the highest and lowest scorers. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that the average of the highest and lowest score is x. So, if I call the highest score H and the lowest score L, then the average would be (H + L)/2 = x. That means H + L equals 2x. Got that part down.\n\nNext, the overall average for the entire class is y, and there are z students. The average is calculated by taking the total sum of all scores and dividing by the number of students. So, the total sum S is y multiplied by z. So, S = y * z. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the average when we exclude the highest and lowest scores. So, we're looking at the sum of the scores from the remaining (z - 2) students. Let's call this new sum S'. \n\nWait, so S' would be the total sum S minus the highest and lowest scores. So, S' = S - H - L. But since H + L is 2x, that means S' = S - 2x. Substituting S with y*z, that becomes S' = y*z - 2x.\n\nNow, the average for the remaining students would be S' divided by (z - 2). So, average = (y*z - 2x) / (z - 2). Let me check the options to see if that's one of them.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is (zy \u2013 2x)/(z -2), which matches what I just calculated. So, that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's go over it again. The average of H and L is x, so H+L=2x. Total sum is y*z. Subtract H and L, so sum is y*z - 2x. Number of students now is z-2. So average is (y*z - 2x)/(z-2). Yep, that's exactly option D. \n\nI think that's solid. The other options don't fit. For example, option A is (zy \u2013 2x)/z, but that would be the average if we subtracted 2x from the total and kept the same number of students, which isn't the case. Option C is (zx \u2013 y)/(z \u2013 2), which looks similar but has zx, which I don't think is part of the setup. So yeah, D is the right choice.\n",
