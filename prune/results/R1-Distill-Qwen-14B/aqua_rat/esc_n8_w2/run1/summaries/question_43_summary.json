      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again: If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent? Hmm, right. I think I remember that percentage reduction involves finding out how much was taken away relative to the original amount. \n\nWait, so the original number is 120, and it's been reduced to 96. So the amount reduced is the difference between these two numbers. Let me calculate that. 120 minus 96 equals... let's see, 120 minus 90 is 30, so 120 minus 96 would be 24. So the reduction is 24.\n\nNow, to find the percentage reduction, I think the formula is (reduction / original) multiplied by 100. So that's (24 / 120) * 100. Let me compute that. 24 divided by 120. Hmm, 120 divided by 24 is 5, so 24/120 is 1/5, which is 0.2. Multiply by 100 gives 20%. So the reduction is 20%. \n\nWait, but I should double-check. 20% of 120 is indeed 24, because 10% is 12, so 20% is 24. So subtracting that from 120 gives 96, which matches the problem. So yeah, the answer should be 20%, which is option C. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The steps seem straightforward. So the correct option is C.\n",

Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that percentage reduction is about how much something has been decreased compared to the original amount. So the formula for percentage decrease is (Original Value - New Value)/Original Value multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nLet me write that down. The formula is:\n\nPercentage Decrease = [(Original - New)/Original] * 100%\n\nIn this problem, the original value is 120 and the new value is 96. So plugging those numbers in:\n\nPercentage Decrease = [(120 - 96)/120] * 100%\n\nLet me calculate the numerator first. 120 minus 96 equals 24. So now it's 24 divided by 120. Hmm, 24 divided by 120... I think that's 0.2 because 24 times 5 is 120, so 24 is 1/5 of 120. Oh right, 1/5 is 0.2. \n\nThen I multiply 0.2 by 100 to get the percentage. 0.2 times 100 is 20. So that's 20%. \n\nWait, let me double-check. If I take 20% of 120, that's 24, and subtracting that from 120 gives 96, which matches the problem. So yeah, that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 20%, so that's the answer. \n\nAnother way to think about it: 120 to 96 is a decrease of 24. What's 24 as a percentage of 120?
