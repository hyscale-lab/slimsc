      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question is about a mixture that contains sand and clay. The initial mixture is 10kg, with 30% sand and 70% clay. The goal is to find out how much of this mixture needs to be removed and replaced with pure sand so that the final mixture has equal amounts of clay and sand.\n\nHmm, let me break it down. So initially, the mixture is 10kg. 30% is sand, so that's 3kg of sand. The rest, 70%, is clay, which is 7kg of clay.\n\nWait, right. So we have 3kg sand and 7kg clay. We need to end up with equal parts, so each should be 5kg, because 10kg divided by 2 is 5kg each. So the final mixture should have 5kg sand and 5kg clay.\n\nBut how do we get there? The process is to remove some mixture and replace it with pure sand. So the key is figuring out how much to remove so that when we add sand, the clay and sand become equal.\n\nLet me think. When we remove some mixture, we're removing both sand and clay in the same proportions as they exist in the mixture. So the percentage of sand and clay in the removed portion will be the same as in the original mixture, right?\n\nLet me denote the amount to be removed as x kg. So when we remove x kg of the mixture, we're taking away (30/100)x kg of sand and (70/100)x kg of clay. So the remaining amounts after removal would be:\n\nSand remaining = 3kg - 0.3x kg\nClay remaining = 7kg - 0.7x kg\n\nThen, we're adding x kg of pure sand. So the new amount of sand becomes (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x kg.\n\nClay remains at (7 - 0.7x) kg.\n\nWe want the final amounts of sand and clay to be equal. So:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nLet me solve for x.\n\nAdding 0.7x to both sides: 3 + 1.4x = 7\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides: 1.4x = 4\n\nDivide both sides by 1.4: x = 4 / 1.4\n\nWait, 4 divided by 1.4. Let me compute that. 1.4 is the same as 14/10, so 4 divided by (14/10) is 4*(10/14) = 40/14 = 20/7. So x is 20/7 kg.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 20/7, which matches this result.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations. So if we remove x=20/7 kg, which is approximately 2.857 kg.\n\nThe initial sand is 3kg. Removing 0.3x is 0.3*(20/7) = 6/7 kg of sand. So remaining sand is 3 - 6/7 = 21/7 -6/7=15/7 kg. Then we add x=20/7 kg of sand, so total sand is 15/7 +20/7=35/7=5kg.\n\nClay: initial 7kg. Remove 0.7x =0.7*(20/7)=2kg. So remaining clay is 7-2=5kg. So yes, both are 5kg each. That works.\n\nSo the correct amount to remove is 20/7 kg, which is option B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by analyzing the initial mixture. The mixture weighs 10 kg, with 30% sand and 70% clay. This means there are initially 3 kg of sand and 7 kg of clay. The goal is to make the final mixture contain equal amounts of sand and clay, i.e., 5 kg each.\n\nTo achieve this, we remove a portion of the mixture and replace it with pure sand. Let the amount removed be \\( x \\) kg. Since the mixture is removed in the same proportion as it exists, the removed portion contains \\( 0.3x \\) kg of sand and \\( 0.7x \\) kg of clay. After removal, the remaining amounts of sand and clay are:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sand remaining} = 3 - 0.3x\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Clay remaining} = 7 - 0.7x\n\\]\n\nWhen \\( x \\) kg of pure sand is added, the new amount of sand becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sand after addition} = (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x\n\\]\n\nThe clay remains unchanged at \\( 7 - 0.7x \\). To achieve equal amounts of sand and clay, we set the two quantities equal:\n\n\\[\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n3 + 1.4x = 7\n\\]\n\\[\n1.4x = 4\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4}{1.4} = \\frac{20}{7}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( x = \\frac{20}{7} \\) kg of the mixture must be removed and replaced with pure sand to make the final mixture contain equal amounts of sand and clay. Verifying, removing \\( \\frac{20}{7} \\) kg removes \\( 0.3 \\cdot \\frac{20}{7} = \\frac{6}{7} \\) kg of sand and \\( 0.7 \\cdot \\frac{20}{7} = 2 \\) kg of clay. After removal, the remaining sand is \\( 3 - \\frac{6}{7} = \\frac{15}{7} \\) kg, and the remaining clay is \\( 7 - 2 = 5 \\) kg. Adding \\( \\frac{20}{7} \\) kg of sand results in a total of \\( \\frac{15}{7} + \\frac{20}{7} = 5 \\) kg of sand, matching the clay. Therefore, the correct amount to remove is \\( \\frac{20}{7} \\) kg.\n\nAnswer: B",

Let me compute that. 1.4 is the same as 14/10, so 4 divided by (14/10) is 4*(10/14) = 40/14 = 20/7.

Hmm, right, so first I should figure out how much sand and clay are in there initially.\n\nWait, 30% of 10 kg is sand. Let me calculate that. 30% is 0.3, so 0.3 * 10 kg = 3 kg of sand. And the rest is clay, which is 70% of 10 kg. 0.7 *10 is 7 kg clay. Got it.\n\nThe goal is to have equal amounts of clay and sand. So, we need the mixture to have 5 kg each, because 5+5=10. Oh wait, no. Wait, wait. If the total mixture remains the same? Or is it changing? Because the question says \"how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand.\" Oh right, so the total mixture after replacement would still be 10 kg. Because we remove some and add an equal amount back. Or wait, no, because it's removing some and adding pure sand. Oh wait, the total remains 10 kg because when you remove X kg and add X kg of sand. So the total is still 10 kg.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose I remove X kg of the mixture. Then, I add X kg of pure sand. So the total becomes 10 - X + X = 10 kg. So the total remains 10 kg.\n\nNow, the new mixture should have equal parts clay and sand. So each should be 5 kg. So, after the replacement, the sand should be 5 kg, and clay should be 5 kg.\n\nLet me model this. Let's denote the amount to be removed as x kg. Since the mixture is 30% sand and 70% clay, when we remove x kg, we're removing 0.3x sand and 0.7x clay. \n\nThen, we add x kg of pure sand. So the new amount of sand is (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x kg.
