      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about the ratio of red to green sweets in a bag. Hmm, the ratio is 3:4. Right, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but let's see. The problem says there are 120 green sweets, and I need to find out how many red ones there are.\n\nWait, the ratio is 3:4 red to green. So for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green ones. That makes sense. So the total parts would be 3 + 4 = 7 parts, but maybe I don't need that right now.\n\nSince the ratio is 3:4, I can think of it as red divided by green equals 3/4. So red/green = 3/4. Or, rearranged, red = (3/4) * green. Oh wait, that's right because in ratios, the first term corresponds to the first quantity.\n\nSo the green sweets are 120. Plugging that into the equation: red = (3/4) * 120. Let me compute that. 120 divided by 4 is 30, and 3 times 30 is 90. So the number of red sweets should be 90.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 90. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I get the ratio the right way around? The question says the ratio of red to green is 3:4. Oh yeah, so red is 3 parts and green is 4. So my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of fractions. If 4 parts correspond to 120 green sweets, then each part is 120 /4 = 30. So each part is 30 sweets. Then red is 3 parts, so 3 *30=90. Yep, same answer.\n\nI don't think I made a mistake here. So the answer must be 90, which is option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe ratio of red to green sweets is 3:4, meaning for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets.

The problem says the ratio of red to green is 3:4. Oh right, that means for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green ones.\n\nWait, the bag has 120 green sweets. So how do I find out how many red sweets there are? I remember that ratios can be used to set up proportions. So if 3 parts correspond to red and 4 parts to green, then the number of red sweets would be (3/4) of the number of green sweets. Or maybe it's the other way around? No, wait, because the ratio is red:green, so red is 3 and green is 4. So if green is 120, that's the 4 parts. \n\nSo maybe I can set up a proportion where 3 (red) over 4 (green) equals x (red) over 120 (green). So 3/4 = x/120. Oh yeah, that makes sense. Then I can solve for x by cross-multiplying. So 3 times 120 equals 4 times x. Let me calculate that. 3 * 120 is 360. So 4x = 360. Then divide both sides by 4: x = 360 /4. Hmm, 360 divided by 4 is 90. So x is 90. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. The ratio is red to green, 3:4. So for every 3 reds, there are 4 greens. So the number of reds is (3/4) of the greens. So yeah, 3/4 * 120 is 90. That seems right.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 90. So that must be the answer. I think that's it. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The calculation seems straightforward. So yeah, I'm confident the answer is A)90.\n",
