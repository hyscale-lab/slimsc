      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a canal's cross-section shaped like a trapezium. Hmm, I remember a trapezium is a four-sided figure with at least one pair of parallel sides. In this case, the canal's cross-section being a trapezium probably means the two parallel sides are the top and bottom of the canal.\n\nThe question gives me the widths: 10 meters at the top and 6 meters at the bottom. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, I think I got that reversed. Wait, in a canal, the top is usually wider than the bottom because the sides slope inwards. So, the top width is 10 m and the bottom is 6 m. So, the two parallel sides are 10 m and 6 m.\n\nThe area of the cross-section is given as 640 square meters. I need to find the depth of the canal. Wait, the depth would be the height of the trapezium, right? Because the height (or depth) is the perpendicular distance between the two parallel sides.\n\nThe formula for the area of a trapezium is (a + b)/2 multiplied by the height h. So, area = (a + b) * h / 2. Here, a and b are the two parallel sides. So, substituting the given values: 640 = (10 + 6) * h / 2.\n\nWait, let me compute that. 10 plus 6 is 16. So 640 = (16) * h / 2. That's 16 * h = 1280. Because 640 multiplied by 2 is 1280. So h would be 1280 /16. Let me calculate that: 1280 divided by 16. 16 times 80 is 1280, so h is 80 meters. Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 80. But wait, that seems really deep for a canal. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait a second, maybe I mixed up the top and bottom. What if the top is 6 and the bottom is 10? No, the question says 10 m wide at the top and 6 m wide at the bottom. So top is 10, bottom 6. So the formula should be correct. Let me redo the math.\n\nArea = (a + b)/2 * h. So 640 = (10+6)/2 * h. 10+6 is 16. 16/2 is 8. So 640 = 8 * h. So h = 640 /8 = 80 meters. So the depth is 80 meters. That's option D.\n\nBut wait, 80 meters deep? That's like a really deep canal. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The area of a trapezium is indeed (sum of the two bases) multiplied by the height, divided by two. So the calculation seems correct. Hmm, but maybe the question is referring to the height as the depth, which is correct. So perhaps the answer is 80.\n\nLooking at the options: D is 80. So the correct answer should be D.\n",

Wait a second. I think the depth here refers to the height of the trapezium. Because in the cross-section of a canal, the depth would be how deep it goes, which is the perpendicular distance between the two parallel sides (the top and bottom widths).\n\nRight, so the area of a trapezium is given by the formula: Area = (sum of the two parallel sides) multiplied by the height (which is the depth here), divided by 2. So the formula is Area = (a + b)/2 * h, where a and b are the lengths of the two parallel sides, and h is the height.\n\nIn this problem, the two parallel sides are the top and bottom of the canal.

But maybe it's correct. Let me double-check the calculations. 10 plus 6 is 16, divided by 2 is 8. 8 times h equals 640. So h is 80. Yeah, the math checks out.
