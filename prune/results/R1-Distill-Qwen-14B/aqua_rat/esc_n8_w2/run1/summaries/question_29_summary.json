      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a jeep traveling a certain distance and then returning with a higher speed. I need to find out the distance it traveled. Hmm, let's think.\n\nThe problem says the jeep takes 6 hours for the forward journey. On the return trip, it increases its speed by 12 km/h and takes 4 hours. So, I'm guessing I need to use the formula for distance, which is speed multiplied by time.\n\nWait, so for the forward journey: distance = speed * time. Let me denote the speed during the forward journey as 'v'. So, the distance would be v * 6. \n\nOn the return trip, the speed is higher. It says it increased by 12 km/h, so the return speed is v + 12. The time taken is 4 hours, so the distance on return is (v +12) *4.\n\nBut wait, the distance should be the same in both directions, right? Because it's going and coming back on the same path. So, I can set these two expressions equal to each other.\n\nSo, v *6 = (v +12) *4. \n\nLet me write that equation down:\n\n6v = 4(v + 12)\n\nExpanding the right side: 6v = 4v + 48\n\nNow, subtract 4v from both sides: 2v = 48\n\nDivide both sides by 2: v = 24 km/h.\n\nSo the speed during the forward journey is 24 km/h. Now, the distance is 6 hours multiplied by 24 km/h. Let me calculate that: 6 *24 is 144. So the distance is 144 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 144 km. So that should be the answer.\n",

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on these types of problems, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nAlright, the jeep goes on a forward journey taking 6 hours. Then, on the return trip, it increases its speed by 12 km/h and takes only 4 hours. I need to find the distance it traveled. Oh wait, since it's the same route going and coming back, the distance should be the same both ways. So, the distance for the forward and return journeys is the same, right?\n\nLet me think about the variables. Let's denote the speed during the forward journey as 'v' km/h. Then, the return journey speed would be 'v + 12' km/h because it's increased by 12.\n\nDistance equals speed multiplied by time. So for the forward journey, the distance would be v * 6 hours. For the return trip, it's (v + 12) * 4 hours. Since the distances are the same, I can set these two expressions equal to each other.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\nv * 6 = (v + 12) * 4.\n\nNow I need to solve for v. Let me expand the right side first. Multiply v by 4 and 12 by 4. So that's 4v + 48.\n\nNow, the equation is 6v = 4v + 48.\n\nHmm, subtract 4v from both sides to get 2v = 48. Then, divide both sides by 2 to find v. So, v = 24 km/h.\n\nWait, that makes sense? Let me check. So the forward speed is 24 km/h. The return speed is 24 + 12 = 36 km/h.\n\nNow, the distance can be calculated using either journey. Let's use the forward journey: distance = 24 km/h * 6 h = 144 km. Alternatively, the return trip would be 36 *4 = 144 km. Yep, that matches. So the distance is 144 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 144 km. So that should be the correct answer.\n",
