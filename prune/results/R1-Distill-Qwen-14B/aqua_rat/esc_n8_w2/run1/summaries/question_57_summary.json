      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a hollow cube. Hmm, let me try to picture it. The cube is 5cm in size, and each face is 5x5, right? But wait, the thickness is 1cm. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the cube is hollow, so the walls are 1cm thick. So the cube is like a box\u2014 the outer part is 5cm on each edge, but the hollow inside is smaller.\n\nWait, how does that work? Let me think. If the cube is 5cm on each edge and has a thickness of 1cm, then the inner dimensions must be 3cm on each side because 5 - 2*(1cm) =3cm. Because the thickness is on both sides\u2014like, 1cm from each face. So the inner cube is 3x3x3 cm. But the problem says it's made of smaller cubes of 1cm. So the entire structure is a 5x5x5 cube, but only the outer layer is present\u2014 the inside is hollow, except for the outer 1cm layer.\n\nWait, no, wait. The cube is hollow, meaning that the inside is empty. So the total cube is 5x5x5, but the hollow part is the inner 3x3x3. Because 5 - 2*1 =3. So the hollow cube is like a shell that's 1cm thick.\n\nNow, the question is about painting the outer surface. When the outer surface is painted, the smaller cubes on the surface will have their outer faces painted. We need to find how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.\n\nSo each small cube is 1x1x1, so each has 6 faces. But some of them are on the outside, so some faces are painted. The unpainted faces are the ones that are either inside the hollow or not exposed to the outside.\n\nWait, no. The question says, how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted. So for each small cube, any face that is not on the outer surface and not part of the hollow (since the hollow is empty, the inner faces are not painted, but the small cubes on the inside of the hollow are not there\u2014because the cube is hollow. Wait, no, the cube is made of small cubes. So the hollow part is made up of small cubes as well? Wait, no\u2014 no, wait. No, because it's hollow. So the hollow part isn't made of any small cubes; it's empty. So the entire cube is a 5x5x5 structure, but the inner 3x3x3 is empty space. So the small cubes are only on the outer layer, making a shell.\n\nWait, but the problem says it's made of smaller cubes of 1cm. So perhaps the entire cube is 5x5x5, made up of 125 small cubes. But because it's hollow, the inner 3x3x3 is empty\u2014so 27 small cubes are missing. So the total number of small cubes present is 125 - 27 = 98? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, wait, if the cube is hollow, but the thickness is 1cm, then the small cubes are arranged such that only the outer layer is present, but the inner is empty. So the total number of small cubes is the surface cubes minus the inner ones.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The cube is 5 cm on each edge, and the thickness is 1 cm. So the inner dimensions are 3 cm on each edge, as the thickness is 1 cm on each side. So the hollow is 3x3x3. But since the cube is made of 1 cm\u00b3 small cubes, the entire structure is 5x5x5 = 125 small cubes. But the hollow part is 3x3x3 =27 small cubes. So the number of small cubes present is 125 -27=98? But wait, that would mean that the hollow part is the inner 3x3x3, and the outer shell is 1 cm thick, made up of 98 small cubes.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Wait, the 5x5x5 cube has 125 small cubes. The hollow is the inner 3x3x3, which has 27 small cubes. So the shell is 125-27=98. But each face of the shell is 5x5, but that's the outer face. But wait, the hollow is 3x3x3, so the inner part is empty. So the cubes in the shell are the ones on the exterior, and the inner part is hollow.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the number of faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. The outer surfaces are painted, so all the outer faces of the shell's small cubes are painted.\n\nEach small cube in the shell has some faces exposed to the outside, which are painted. The internal faces (those adjacent to the hollow) are not painted because there's no paint applied inside. Also, any internal faces that are adjacent to other small cubes in the shell are also not painted, as the paint is only on the outer surfaces.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the faces of the small cubes. Each small cube in the shell has some faces on the outside (painted), and some faces on the inside (unpainted, because the hollow is empty, so those faces aren't painted). But wait, the hollow is empty, so the small cubes in the shell have their inner faces exposed to air. But since the paint is only on the outer surfaces, those inner faces are not painted.\n\nWait, but the small cubes in the shell: for each cube on the corner, they have 3 faces painted; on the edges (but not corners), 2 faces painted; on the faces (but not edges or corners), 1 face painted; and the cubes that are only on the inner part of the shell (but that's not possible because the shell is 1 cm thick\u2014so all the shell cubes are on the outer 1 cm layer. So each cube in the shell is either on a corner, edge, or face, but not in the inner part.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify. The shell is 1 cm thick. So for each face of the cube, the outer layer is 1 cm thick. So for each face, the small cubes are arranged in a 5x5 grid on the outside, but the inner part (3x3) is empty. So each small cube in the shell is either on the corner, edge, or face of the entire cube.\n\nSo each small cube in the shell has some of its faces exposed to the outside (and thus painted) and some faces adjacent to other small cubes in the shell or to the hollow.\n\nSo for each small cube in the shell:\n\n- Corner cubes: each has 3 faces painted. The other 3 faces are either adjacent to other cubes (so not painted) or to the hollow (so not painted).\n\n- Edge cubes (but not corners): each has 2 faces painted. The other 4 faces: two adjacent to other cubes, two adjacent to the hollow.\n\nWait, no. For edge cubes, each is on an edge of the cube. For example, on the top front edge (but not the corner). Each such cube has two painted faces (front and top), and the other four faces: two adjacent to other cubes (left and right), and two facing the hollow (the back and the bottom). So for these, two faces are painted, and the other four are not.\n\nSimilarly, for face cubes (not edges or corners): each is on a face, but not on an edge. For example, the center of the top face. This cube has one painted face (the top). The other five faces: four adjacent to other cubes (front, back, left, right) and one facing the hollow (the bottom). So in this case, one face painted, five unpainted.\n\nWait, but each face of the small cube is either on the outside (painted) or adjacent to another small cube or the hollow (unpainted). So the total number of unpainted faces per small cube depends on its position.\n\nBut the question is asking for the total number of unpainted faces across all small cubes in the shell.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of small cubes in the shell. That's 125 (total) - 27 (hollow) =98.\n\n2. For each small cube, determine how many of its faces are unpainted.\n\n3. Sum all these unpainted faces across all 98 small cubes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a smarter way is to calculate the total number of faces each cube has, subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. So 98 cubes \u00d76 =588 total faces.\n\nNow, how many of these are painted? Because the outer surfaces are painted. So the number of painted faces is the sum of all the outer faces of the cube.\n\nThe cube has 6 faces, each 5x5. So each face has 25 small cube faces. So 6 \u00d725=150 painted faces.\n\nSo the total painted faces are 150. Therefore, the unpainted faces are 588 -150=438.\n\nWait, but wait! Because each face of the small cube that is on the outside is painted, but for the internal faces, if they are adjacent to other small cubes, they are not painted. However, the faces that are adjacent to the hollow are also not painted.\n\nWait, but in this approach, the 150 painted faces are correct. So total unpainted faces are 588-150=438. So the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\nBut let me think again. Are all the other faces (non-painted) included in the 588? Yes, because each small cube has 6 faces, whether they are painted or not. So the total unpainted faces are 588-150=438.\n\nSo the correct answer is A)438.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube structure. The cube has an outer dimension of 5 cm on each edge and a thickness of 1 cm, making the hollow inner dimensions 3 cm on each edge. The entire cube is made of 1 cm\u00b3 smaller cubes, totaling 125 small cubes. Since the inner 3x3x3 region is hollow, it contains no small cubes, leaving 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes in the shell.\n\nEach small cube in the shell has 6 faces, so the total number of faces across all 98 cubes is:\n\n\\[\n98 \\times 6 = 588\n\\]\n\nThe outer surfaces of the cube are painted.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a hollow cube. Let me try to visualize it first. The cube is 5cm on each side, and its thickness is 1cm. So, it's like a cube made of smaller 1cm\u00b3 cubes, but the inside is hollow, right? So the outer layer is 1cm thick, and the inside is empty.\n\nThe question is about painting the outer surface of this cube and then figuring out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted. Hmm, I think that means we need to find the number of smaller cube faces that aren't on the outer surface, which would be the inner ones.\n\nWait, no, actually, the outer surface is painted. So the question is asking for the number of smaller cube faces that are not painted, i.e., the ones that are on the inside or maybe on the inner surfaces that aren't exposed to the outside.\n\nWait, no, each small cube can have multiple faces. But since the outer surface is painted, any face of a small cube that's on the outside will be painted. The question is about the faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. So, the total number of small cubes is something, and each has 6 faces. But we need to find how many of these faces are not painted.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's first figure out how many small cubes there are in total, and then subtract the ones that are on the outside (the painted ones). But wait, the problem is about the faces, not the cubes. So perhaps I should calculate the total number of faces of all small cubes and subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is simpler. The cube is hollow, so the inner part isn't there. So the structure is like a shell. Each face of the cube is a 5x5 square of small cubes, but the thickness is 1cm, so the inner part is 3x3x3 (since 5-2=3). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the cube is size 5cm, and the thickness is 1cm, so the hollow part is 5-2*1 = 3 cm on each side. So the inner hollow cube is 3x3x3, but it's empty. So the total number of small cubes is the outer shell.\n\nWait, let me get this straight. The entire cube is 5x5x5 cm, made up of 1x1x1 cm cubes. So normally, without being hollow, it would have 125 small cubes (5^3). But since it's hollow, the inner part is 3x3x3, which is 27 small cubes. So the number of small cubes in the hollow cube is 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes.\n\nWait, but the thickness is 1cm, so the shell is 1cm thick. So the outer layer is 5x5x5, and the inner is 3x3x3. So yes, 125-27=98 small cubes in the shell.\n\nBut the question isn't about the number of small cubes. It's about the number of their faces that are unpainted. So each small cube in the shell has some faces painted and some not.\n\nWait, the outer surface is painted, so any face of a small cube that's on the outside of the larger cube is painted. The inner faces (like the hollow part) aren't painted because the paint is only on the outer surfaces.\n\nWait, but the hollow cube's inner surfaces are not exposed, so their faces aren't painted either. So the unpainted faces would include the inner surfaces of the shell as well as any faces of the small cubes that are adjacent to other small cubes in the shell but not on the outer surface.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of faces of all the small cubes and subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. So 98 small cubes have 98 *6 = 588 faces in total.\n\nNow, how many of these are painted? The painted faces are all the outer surfaces of the larger cube. The larger cube has 6 faces, each 5x5 cm, so each face has 25 small cube faces. So 6 *25 =150 painted faces.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The larger cube's outer surface is painted, so each face of the larger cube has 5x5=25 small cube faces painted. So total painted faces are 6 *25 =150.\n\nBut wait, the small cubes in the shell are 98. So each small cube may have 1, 2, or more painted faces. For example, a corner cube would have 3 painted faces, an edge cube (not a corner) would have 2, and a face cube (not edge or corner) would have 1. The inner cubes of the shell, which are not on the outer surfaces, would have 0 painted faces.\n\nWait, no. No, the small cubes in the shell are all on the outer layer, so every small cube in the shell has at least one face on the outer surface. So each of the 98 small cubes has at least one face painted.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the faces of the small cubes that are unpainted. So total faces: 588. Painted faces:150. So unpainted faces would be 588 -150 =438.\n\nWait, but wait. That can't be right, because some small cubes are on the inner surfaces of the shell. Those inner surfaces are not painted because they are inside the hollow part. So each small cube in the shell may have both outer and inner faces, but the inner ones are not painted. Wait, no, the inner surfaces of the shell are part of the larger cube's structure. So for example, each face of the shell's inner side is adjacent to the hollow space. So the small cubes in the shell have one face on the outside (painted) and another face on the inside (unpainted if it's a face cube), but for edge and corner cubes, they have more.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think differently. The total number of painted small cube faces is the outer surface area of the larger cube, which is 6*(5x5) = 150. So 150 painted faces.\n\nThe total number of small cube faces is 98*6=588.\n\nSo the unpainted faces are 588 -150 =438.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 438. So the answer would be A.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Is that correct? Because the small cubes in the shell have both outer and inner faces. But the inner faces are part of the hollow, so they are not painted. So the painted faces are only the ones on the outside.\n\nSo the painted faces are 150. So the unpainted ones are 588-150=438. So option A is correct.\n",

So the outer layer is 1cm thick, and the inside is empty.\n\nThe question is about painting the outer surface of this cube and then figuring out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted. Hmm, I think that means we need to find the number of smaller cube faces that aren't on the outer surface, which would be the inner ones.\n\nWait, no, actually, the outer surface is painted. So the question is asking for the number of smaller cube faces that are not painted, i.e., the ones that are on the inside or maybe on the inner surfaces that aren't exposed to the outside.\n\nWait, no, each small cube can have multiple faces. But since the outer surface is painted, any face of a small cube that's on the outside will be painted. The question is about the faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. So, the total number of small cubes is something, and each has 6 faces. But we need to find how many of these faces are not painted.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's first figure out how many small cubes there are in total, and then subtract the ones that are on the outside (the painted ones). But wait, the problem is about the faces, not the cubes. So perhaps I should calculate the total number of faces of all small cubes and subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is simpler. The cube is hollow, so the inner part isn't there. So the structure is like a shell. Each face of the cube is a 5x5 square of small cubes, but the thickness is 1cm, so the inner part is 3x3x3 (since 5-2=3). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the cube is size 5cm, and the thickness is 1cm, so the hollow part is 5-2*1 = 3 cm on each side. So the inner hollow cube is 3x3x3, but it's empty. So the total number of small cubes is the outer shell.\n\nWait, let me get this straight. The entire cube is 5x5x5 cm, made up of 1x1x1 cm cubes. So normally, without being hollow, it would have 125 small cubes (5^3). But since it's hollow, the inner part is 3x3x3, which is 27 small cubes. So the number of small cubes in the hollow cube is 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes.\n\nWait, but the thickness is 1cm, so the shell is 1cm thick. So the outer layer is 5x5x5, and the inner is 3x3x3. So yes, 125-27=98 small cubes in the shell.\n\nBut the question isn't about the number of small cubes. It's about the number of their faces that are unpainted. So each small cube in the shell has some faces painted and some not.\n\nWait, the outer surface is painted, so any face of a small cube that's on the outside of the larger cube is painted. The inner faces (like the hollow part) aren't painted because the paint is only on the outer surfaces.\n\nWait, but the hollow cube's inner surfaces are not exposed, so their faces aren't painted either. So the unpainted faces would include the inner surfaces of the shell as well as any faces of the small cubes that are adjacent to other small cubes in the shell but not on the outer surface.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of faces of all the small cubes and subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. So 98 small cubes have 98 *6 = 588 faces in total.\n\nNow, how many of these are painted? The painted faces are all the outer surfaces of the larger cube. The larger cube has 6 faces, each 5x5 cm, so each face has 25 small cube faces. So 6 *25 =150 painted faces.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The larger cube's outer surface is painted, so each face of the larger cube has 5x5=25 small cube faces painted. So total painted faces are 6 *25 =150.\n\nBut wait, the small cubes in the shell are 98. So each small cube may have 1, 2, or more painted faces. For example, a corner cube would have 3 painted faces, an edge cube (not a corner) would have 2, and a face cube (not edge or corner) would have 1. The inner cubes of the shell, which are not on the outer surfaces, would have 0 painted faces.\n\nWait, no. No, the small cubes in the shell are all on the outer layer, so every small cube in the shell has at least one face on the outer surface. So each of the 98 small cubes has at least one face painted.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the faces of the small cubes that are unpainted. So total faces: 588. Painted faces:150. So unpainted faces would be 588 -150 =438.\n\nWait, but wait. That can't be right, because some small cubes are on the inner surfaces of the shell. Those inner surfaces are not painted because they are inside the hollow part. So each small cube in the shell may have both outer and inner faces, but the inner ones are not painted. Wait, no, the inner surfaces of the shell are part of the larger cube's structure. So for example, each face of the shell's inner side is adjacent to the hollow space. So the small cubes in the shell have one face on the outside (painted) and another face on the inside (unpainted if it's a face cube), but for edge and corner cubes, they have more.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think differently. The total number of painted small cube faces is the outer surface area of the larger cube, which is 6*(5x5) = 150. So 150 painted faces.\n\nThe total number of small cube faces is 98*6=588.\n\nSo the unpainted faces are 588 -150 =438.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 438. So the answer would be A.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Is that correct? Because the small cubes in the shell have both outer and inner faces. But the inner faces are part of the hollow, so they are not painted. So the painted faces are only the ones on the outside.\n\nSo the painted faces are 150. So the unpainted ones are 588-150=438. So option A is correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by analyzing the hollow cube. The cube has a total size of 5 cm on each side and a thickness of 1 cm, meaning it is made up of smaller 1 cm\u00b3 cubes arranged in a 5x5x5 grid. The hollow part inside is a 3x3x3 cube, leaving a shell of small cubes. The total number of small cubes in the shell is:\n\n\\[\n5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98 \\, \\text{small cubes}.\n\\]\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces for all the small cubes in the shell is:\n\n\\[\n98 \\times 6 = 588 \\, \\text{faces}.\n\\]\n\nThe outer surface of the cube is painted. The larger cube has 6 faces, each of size \\(5 \\times 5\\), so the total number of painted faces is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 25 = 150 \\, \\text{painted faces}.\n\\]\n\nThe unpainted faces are the total faces of the small cubes minus the painted faces:\n\n\\[\n588 - 150 = 438 \\, \\text{unpainted faces}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is **438**.\n\nAnswer: A",
