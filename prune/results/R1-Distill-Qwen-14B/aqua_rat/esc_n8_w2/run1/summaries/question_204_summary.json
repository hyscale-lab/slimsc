      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again: What is 60% of 30% of 1400 grams? The options are A)450, B)100, C)252, D)240, and E)None of these. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nAlright, percentages can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that 'of' in math problems usually means multiplication. So, 60% of something is 0.6 times that something. But here, it's 60% of 30% of 1400 grams. So I think I should calculate it in parts.\n\nFirst, let's find 30% of 1400 grams. Wait, 30% is the same as 0.3. So 0.3 multiplied by 1400. Let me do that: 1400 * 0.3. Hmm, 1400 divided by 10 is 140, so 140 * 3 is 420. So 30% of 1400 is 420 grams.\n\nNow, the next step is to find 60% of that 420 grams. Okay, 60% is 0.6. So 420 * 0.6. Let me calculate that. 420 times 0.6... well, 400 * 0.6 is 240, and 20 * 0.6 is 12, so 240 +12 is 252. So 60% of 420 is 252 grams.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I did that right. Another way to think about it: 30% is 0.3, and 60% is 0.6. So the combined calculation is 0.6 * 0.3 * 1400. Let me compute that. 0.6 times 0.3 is 0.18. Then 0.18 times 1400. Hmm, 1400 * 0.18. \n\nBreaking that down: 1400 * 0.1 is 140, and 1400 * 0.08 is 112. Adding those together, 140 + 112 is 252. Yep, same result. So that checks out.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 252 grams. So that should be the correct answer. Let me just quickly scan the options again. A is 450, which is way bigger. B is 100, way too small. D is 240, which is close but not quite. So yeah, option C is correct.\n",

Hmm, percentages can sometimes trip me up, but I think I can handle this.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. First, I know that percentages are parts per hundred. So 30% means 30 per 100, or 0.3 in decimal form. Similarly, 60% is 0.6.\n\nThe question is asking for 60% of 30% of 1400 grams. So, I should calculate it in two steps. Maybe first find 30% of 1400 grams, then take 60% of that result.\n\nWait, or could I do it all in one go? Because percentages are multiplicative. Let me think. 30% of 1400 is 0.3 * 1400, right? Then 60% of that would be 0.6 multiplied by the previous result. So overall, it's 0.6 * (0.3 * 1400). Alternatively, I can multiply the two decimals first: 0.6 * 0.3 = 0.18. Then multiply 0.18 by 1400. That might be easier.\n\nLet me calculate that. 0.18 times 1400. Hmm, 1400 is 14 * 100. So 0.18 * 14 is... let me compute that. 14 * 0.18. 14 * 0.1 is 1.4, and 14 * 0.08 is 1.12. Adding them together gives 1.4 + 1.12 = 2.52. So 2.52 multiplied by 100 is 252. So the result is 252 grams.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Alternatively, calculate 30% of 1400 first. 30% is 0.3, so 1400 * 0.3. 1400 * 0.3 is 420. Then, 60% of 420 grams. 60% is 0.6, so 420 * 0.6. Let's compute that: 400 *0.6 is 240, and 20 *0.6 is 12. So 240 +12 is 252. Same result. Okay, so that seems correct.\n\nLooking back at the options: A is 450 grams, which is much higher. B is 100, way too low. C is 252, which matches what I got. D is 240, which is close but not quite. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Could I have made a mistake in the multiplication? Let me recalculate 0.3 *1400. 1400 *0.3: 1400 * 0.3 is 420. Then 0.6 *420. 420 * 0.6. Let's do this step by step. 400 *0.6=240, 20 *0.6=12. So 240+12=252. Yep, same as before.\n\nSo the correct answer is C, 252 grams. Looking at the options, option C is 252 gms.\n",
