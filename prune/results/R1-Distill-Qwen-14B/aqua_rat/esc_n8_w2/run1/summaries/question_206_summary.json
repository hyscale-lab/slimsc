      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so it's about alloys and their densities, I think. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nSo, there's a coin made of an alloy of aluminum and silver. Its dimensions are 2 mm thick and a diameter of 15 mm. The weight is 30 grams. The volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to that of silver. Now, we need to find the weight of another coin that's 1 mm thick and 30 mm diameter, made of pure aluminum. Oh, and silver is twice as heavy as aluminum.\n\nWait, okay, so first, I think I need to find the densities of aluminum and silver based on the given information, or maybe find the proportion of each in the alloy. Since the volumes of Al and Ag are equal in the alloy, the alloy is 50% Al and 50% Ag by volume.\n\nBut wait, the alloy's density isn't the average of the two because they have different densities. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum. Wait, does that mean the density of silver is twice that of aluminum? Let me think. The problem says silver is twice as heavy as aluminum. So, density of Ag is 2 times that of Al. Let me note that down.\n\nLet me denote the density of aluminum as d. Then, density of silver is 2d.\n\nNow, the first coin's volume is calculated from its dimensions. It's a cylinder, right? So volume V = \u03c0r\u00b2h. The diameter is 15 mm, so radius r is 7.5 mm. Thickness is 2 mm, so h is 2 mm.\n\nCalculating the volume of the first coin: V = \u03c0*(7.5)^2*2. Let me compute that. 7.5 squared is 56.25, multiplied by 2 is 112.5. So V = 112.5\u03c0 mm\u00b3.\n\nWait, but units are important here. The weight is given in grams, so I probably need to convert everything into compatible units. Let me think about the densities in grams per cm\u00b3 because 1 cm\u00b3 is 1 mL, and grams are easy to work with.\n\nWait, I know the density of aluminum is about 2.7 g/cm\u00b3, but wait, maybe I shouldn't use real-world values because the problem gives a ratio. Oh, right, the problem says silver is twice as heavy as aluminum. So if Al has density d, Ag has 2d.\n\nSo the first coin is an alloy with equal volumes of Al and Ag. So half of its volume is Al, half is Ag.\n\nSo the mass of the alloy coin is 30 grams. Let me compute the mass contributed by each metal.\n\nMass of Al in the alloy: (Volume of Al) * density of Al = (V/2)*d.\n\nMass of Ag in alloy: (V/2) * 2d = Vd.\n\nSo total mass = (V/2)*d + Vd = (Vd/2) + Vd = (3Vd)/2.\n\nWait, but the total mass is given as 30 grams. So 3Vd/2 = 30 grams. So solving for Vd: Vd = 20 grams.\n\nWait, but I can compute Vd from the volume of the coin. Because V is the total volume of the alloy, which is 112.5\u03c0 mm\u00b3. Wait, but let's convert that to cm\u00b3 because 1 cm\u00b3 is 1000 mm\u00b3. So 112.5\u03c0 mm\u00b3 is 0.1125\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo Vd = 0.1125\u03c0 * d * 1000 mm\u00b3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, V is in mm\u00b3. To convert to cm\u00b3, divide by 1000. So V is 112.5\u03c0 mm\u00b3 = 0.1125\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo, from earlier, Vd = 20 grams.\n\nSo 0.1125\u03c0 * d * (density in g/cm\u00b3) ?\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me express the mass in terms of the densities.\n\nThe alloy's total mass is (volume of Al * density Al) + (volume of Ag * density Ag).\n\nSince the volumes are equal, V = V_al = V_ag.\n\nSo mass = V_al * d + V_ag * 2d = V*(d + 2d) = V*(3d).\n\nBut wait, that's the same as 3Vd. Wait, but earlier I had 3Vd/2 equals 30 grams. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, wait. The initial calculation I did was correct. So 3Vd/2 =30 \u2192 Vd=20.\n\nWait, but then Vd is 20 grams. So what is Vd? V is the volume of the alloy, which is 0.1125\u03c0 cm\u00b3, and d is the density of Al in g/cm\u00b3.\n\nWait, no, Vd would be V multiplied by d. So 0.1125\u03c0 * d = 20 grams.\n\nWait, because from 3Vd/2 =30 \u2192 Vd=20.\n\nSo, Vd = 20 grams.\n\nSo 0.1125\u03c0 * d =20 \u2192 d = 20/(0.1125\u03c0) g/cm\u00b3.\n\nWait, let me compute that numerically. Let's compute 0.1125\u03c0. \u03c0 is approx 3.1416, so 0.1125 *3.1416 \u2248 0.3534 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo d = 20 / 0.3534 \u2248 56.6 g/cm\u00b3. Wait, that can't be right because aluminum's density is about 2.7 g/cm\u00b3. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the units. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, the volume of the coin is 2 mm thick and 15 mm diameter. So radius is 7.5 mm. Volume is \u03c0*(7.5)^2 * 2 mm\u00b3. Let me compute that: 7.5 squared is 56.25, multiplied by 2 is 112.5. So 112.5 * \u03c0 mm\u00b3.\n\nConvert mm\u00b3 to cm\u00b3: 1 mm\u00b3 is 1e-3 cm\u00b3. So 112.5\u03c0 mm\u00b3 is 112.5\u03c0 * 1e-3 cm\u00b3 = 0.1125\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo V = 0.1125\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo the equation is 3Vd/2 =30 grams.\n\nSo 3*(0.1125\u03c0)*d /2 =30.\n\nSo 3 * 0.1125 is 0.3375. Multiply by \u03c0: 0.3375\u03c0. Divided by 2: 0.16875 \u03c0.\n\nSo 0.16875 \u03c0 * d =30 grams.\n\nSolving for d: d = 30 / (0.16875 \u03c0) \u2248 30/(0.5301) \u224856.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nThat's way higher than aluminum's actual density, which is around 2.7. So that can't be right. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, maybe the initial approach is incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the alloy's density. Since the alloy has equal volumes of Al and Ag, each with densities d and 2d. The alloy's density would be the average, but wait, no, because the volumes are equal, not the masses.\n\nSo the alloy's density is (mass of Al + mass of Ag) divided by total volume.\n\nMass of Al: (V/2)*d.\n\nMass of Ag: (V/2)*2d = Vd.\n\nTotal mass: (Vd/2) + Vd = 3Vd/2.\n\nTotal volume: V.\n\nSo alloy density = (3Vd/2) / V = 3d/2.\n\nSo alloy's density is 1.5d.\n\nWait, but I don't know the alloy's density. Hmm, but I can compute the alloy's density from the mass and volume.\n\nAlloy's mass is 30 grams, volume is 0.1125\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo alloy's density is 30 / (0.1125\u03c0) \u224830/(0.3534) \u224884.88 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nBut according to earlier, alloy's density is 1.5d. So 1.5d =84.88 \u2192 d\u224856.59 g/cm\u00b3. Again, same problem.\n\nThis suggests that the approach is wrong. Because real aluminum is 2.7 g/cm\u00b3, but according to this, d is way higher. So I must have made a mistake in my assumptions.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial setup is wrong. Let's think differently. The problem says that the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver in the alloy. So, each is V/2.\n\nBut when calculating mass, mass of Al is (V/2)*d, mass of Ag is (V/2)*2d = Vd.\n\nSo total mass is (Vd/2) + Vd = 3Vd/2 =30 grams.\n\nSo 3Vd/2 =30 \u2192 Vd=20 grams.\n\nBut V is the volume of the alloy, which is 0.1125\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo Vd=0.1125\u03c0 *d =20.\n\nSo d=20/(0.1125\u03c0) \u224820/(0.3534)\u224856.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nAgain, same result. So this suggests that perhaps the problem isn't about real-world densities but a hypothetical scenario where silver is twice as dense as aluminum. So the approach is correct in the problem's context.\n\nSo, moving on, now we have d\u224856.6 g/cm\u00b3. But wait, maybe we don't need the actual value because the next part is about a pure aluminum coin.\n\nSo the second coin has dimensions 1 mm thick and 30 mm diameter. So radius is 15 mm. Volume is \u03c0*(15)^2 *1 mm\u00b3 = 225\u03c0 mm\u00b3.\n\nConvert to cm\u00b3: 225\u03c0 *1e-3 cm\u00b3 = 0.225\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nThis coin is pure aluminum, so its mass is volume * density of Al.\n\nDensity of Al is d = 56.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is, what is the weight of the second coin? So mass = volume * density.\n\nSo volume is 0.225\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nMass = 0.225\u03c0 * d.\n\nBut d is 56.6, so 0.225 * \u03c0 *56.6 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute this. 0.225 *56.6 \u224812.735. Multiply by \u03c0: 12.735 *3.1416\u224840 grams.\n\nWait, that's option B)40 grams.\n\nWait, but wait, another approach: since the first alloy had V=0.1125\u03c0 cm\u00b3, and the second coin is 0.225\u03c0 cm\u00b3. So it's twice the volume. But wait, the first coin is alloy with density 84.88 g/cm\u00b3, so the second is pure Al. So the mass would be 0.225\u03c0 * d.\n\nBut from earlier, Vd=20 grams, where V was 0.1125\u03c0. So 0.1125\u03c0 *d=20 \u2192 d=20/(0.1125\u03c0) \u224856.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nSo 0.225\u03c0 *d = 0.225\u03c0 * (20/(0.1125\u03c0)) ) \u2192 0.225/0.1125 is 2, multiplied by 20 gives 40 grams.\n\nAh, that's a smarter way to compute it. So the answer is 40 grams, which is option B.\n",

Let me compute the mass contributed by each metal.\n\nMass of Al in the alloy: (Volume of Al) * density of Al = (V/2)*d.\n\nMass of Ag in alloy: (V/2) * 2d = Vd.\n\nSo total mass = (V/2)*d + Vd = (Vd/2) + Vd = (3Vd)/2.\n\nWait, but the total mass is given as 30 grams. So 3Vd/2 = 30 grams. So solving for Vd: Vd = 20 grams.\n\nWait, but I can compute Vd from the volume of the coin. Because V is the total volume of the alloy, which is 112.5\u03c0 mm\u00b3. Wait, but let's convert that to cm\u00b3 because 1 cm\u00b3 is 1000 mm\u00b3. So 112.5\u03c0 mm\u00b3 is 0.1125\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo Vd = 0.1125\u03c0 * d * 1000 mm\u00b3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, V is in mm\u00b3. To convert to cm\u00b3, divide by 1000. So V is 112.5\u03c0 mm\u00b3 = 0.1125\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo, from earlier, Vd = 20 grams.\n\nSo 0.1125\u03c0 * d * (density in g/cm\u00b3) ?\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I should approach this differently.

So what is Vd? V is the volume of the alloy, which is 0.1125\u03c0 cm\u00b3, and d is the density of Al in g/cm\u00b3.\n\nWait, no, Vd would be V multiplied by d. So 0.1125\u03c0 * d = 20 grams.\n\nWait, because from 3Vd/2 =30 \u2192 Vd=20.\n\nSo, Vd = 20 grams.\n\nSo 0.1125\u03c0 * d =20 \u2192 d = 20/(0.1125\u03c0) g/cm\u00b3.\n\nWait, let me compute that numerically.

Let me compute that: 7.5 squared is 56.25, multiplied by 2 is 112.5. So 112.5 * \u03c0 mm\u00b3.\n\nConvert mm\u00b3 to cm\u00b3: 1 mm\u00b3 is 1e-3 cm\u00b3. So 112.5\u03c0 mm\u00b3 is 112.5\u03c0 * 1e-3 cm\u00b3 = 0.1125\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo V = 0.1125\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo the equation is 3Vd/2 =30 grams.\n\nSo 3*(0.1125\u03c0)*d /2 =30.\n\nSo 3 * 0.1125 is 0.3375. Multiply by \u03c0: 0.3375\u03c0.

Hmm, but I can compute the alloy's density from the mass and volume.\n\nAlloy's mass is 30 grams, volume is 0.1125\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo alloy's density is 30 / (0.1125\u03c0) \u224830/(0.3534) \u224884.88 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nBut according to earlier, alloy's density is 1.5d.

So this suggests that perhaps the problem isn't about real-world densities but a hypothetical scenario where silver is twice as dense as aluminum. So the approach is correct in the problem's context.\n\nSo, moving on, now we have d\u224856.6 g/cm\u00b3. But wait, maybe we don't need the actual value because the next part is about a pure aluminum coin.\n\nSo the second coin has dimensions 1 mm thick and 30 mm diameter. So radius is 15 mm. Volume is \u03c0*(15)^2 *1 mm\u00b3 = 225\u03c0 mm\u00b3.\n\nConvert to cm\u00b3: 225\u03c0 *1e-3 cm\u00b3 = 0.225\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nThis coin is pure aluminum, so its mass is volume * density of Al.\n\nDensity of Al is d = 56.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is, what is the weight of the second coin? So mass = volume * density.\n\nSo volume is 0.225\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nMass = 0.225\u03c0 * d.\n\nBut d is 56.6, so 0.225 * \u03c0 *56.6 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute this. 0.225 *56.6 \u224812.735. Multiply by \u03c0: 12.735 *3.1416\u224840 grams.\n\nWait, that's option B)40 grams.\n\nWait, but wait, another approach: since the first alloy had V=0.1125\u03c0 cm\u00b3, and the second coin is 0.225\u03c0 cm\u00b3. So it's twice the volume. But wait, the first coin is alloy with density 84.88 g/cm\u00b3, so the second is pure Al. So the mass would be 0.225\u03c0 * d.\n\nBut from earlier, Vd=20 grams, where V was 0.1125\u03c0. So 0.1125\u03c0 *d=20 \u2192 d=20/(0.1125\u03c0) \u224856.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nSo 0.225\u03c0 *d = 0.225\u03c0 * (20/(0.1125\u03c0)) ) \u2192 0.225/0.1125 is 2, multiplied by 20 gives 40 grams.\n\nAh, that's a smarter way to compute it. So the answer is 40 grams, which is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the alloy coin and the pure aluminum coin step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Alloy Coin Analysis\nThe alloy coin has dimensions:  \n- Thickness = 2 mm  \n- Diameter = 15 mm \u2192 Radius = 7.5 mm  \n\nThe volume of the alloy coin is calculated using the formula for the volume of a cylinder:  \n\\[\nV_{\\text{alloy}} = \\pi r^2 h = \\pi (7.5)^2 (2) = 112.5\\pi \\, \\text{mm}^3\n\\]  \nConvert to cm\u00b3:  \n\\[\nV_{\\text{alloy}} = 112.5\\pi \\times 10^{-3} = 0.1125\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n\\]  \n\nThe alloy consists of equal volumes of aluminum (Al) and silver (Ag). Let the density of aluminum be \\(d\\) g/cm\u00b3. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the density of silver is \\(2d\\) g/cm\u00b3. The total mass of the alloy is given as 30 grams.  \n\nThe mass of the alloy can be expressed as:  \n\\[\n\\text{Mass of alloy} = \\left(\\frac{V_{\\text{alloy}}}{2}\\right) \\cdot d + \\left(\\frac{V_{\\text{alloy}}}{2}\\right) \\cdot 2d = \\frac{V_{\\text{alloy}}}{2} \\cdot d + V_{\\text{alloy}} \\cdot d = \\frac{3V_{\\text{alloy}} \\cdot d}{2}\n\\]  \nSubstitute \\(V_{\\text{alloy}} = 0.1125\\pi\\) and \\(\\text{Mass of alloy} = 30\\):  \n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\cdot 0.1125\\pi \\cdot d}{2} = 30\n\\]  \nSimplify:  \n\\[\n0.16875\\pi \\cdot d = 30 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad d = \\frac{30}{0.16875\\pi} \\approx 56.6 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3\n\\]  \n\nThus, the density of aluminum is approximately \\(d = 56.6 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Pure Aluminum Coin Analysis\nThe second coin has dimensions:  \n- Thickness = 1 mm  \n- Diameter = 30 mm \u2192 Radius = 15 mm  \n\nThe volume of the pure aluminum coin is:  \n\\[\nV_{\\text{aluminum}} = \\pi r^2 h = \\pi (15)^2 (1) = 225\\pi \\, \\text{mm}^3\n\\]  \nConvert to cm\u00b3:  \n\\[\nV_{\\text{aluminum}} = 225\\pi \\times 10^{-3} = 0.225\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n\\]  \n\nThe mass of the pure aluminum coin is:  \n\\[\n\\text{Mass of aluminum coin} = V_{\\text{aluminum}} \\cdot d = 0.225\\pi \\cdot 56.6\n\\]  \nSubstitute \\(d = 56.6\\):  \n\\[\n\\text{Mass of aluminum coin} \\approx 0.225 \\cdot 3.1416 \\cdot 56.6 \\approx 40 \\, \\text{grams}\n\\]  \n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\nThe weight of the pure aluminum coin is **40 grams**.  \n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about coins made of aluminum and silver alloys. Hmm, let me try to break it down.\n\nThe first coin is an alloy of aluminum and silver. It measures 2 mm thick and a diameter of 15 mm. The weight is 30 grams. Also, the volume of aluminum is equal to the volume of silver in the alloy. So, it's 50-50 by volume.\n\nWait, but the question is about a second coin. This one measures 1 mm thick and a diameter of 30 mm. It's made of pure aluminum. And the twist is that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum. We need to find the weight of this second coin.\n\nHmm, I think I need to find the densities or something. Because the weight depends on volume and density.\n\nLet me think. Since the first coin is an alloy with equal volumes of Al and Ag, each component is half the volume of the coin. So the total volume of the alloy is V = V_al + V_silver, but since they're equal, each is V/2.\n\nWait, but wait. The coin's volume is based on its dimensions. The first coin is 2mm thick, diameter 15mm. So the volume is area times thickness. The area is \u03c0r\u00b2. So radius is 15/2 =7.5 mm. So area is \u03c0*(7.5)^2 mm\u00b2. Thickness is 2 mm. So volume is \u03c0*(7.5)^2 *2 mm\u00b3. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, but I'll need to convert mm to meters if I'm working with SI units, but maybe I can work in grams and mm\u00b3 since the density would be in g/cm\u00b3 or similar.\n\nWait, let's compute the volume first.\n\nVolume of first coin: V = \u03c0*(d/2)^2 * t = \u03c0*(15/2)^2 *2 mm\u00b3.\n\n15 mm is 0.015 m? Wait, maybe better to compute in mm\u00b3.\n\nSo, V = \u03c0 * (7.5)^2 * 2 = \u03c0 * 56.25 *2 = \u03c0 * 112.5 mm\u00b3 \u2248 353.43 mm\u00b3.\n\nBut wait, the coin's volume is 353.43 mm\u00b3. But it's half aluminum and half silver by volume, so each has a volume of 176.715 mm\u00b3.\n\nWait, but the weight of the coin is 30 grams. So the total mass is 30 grams. But that's the sum of the masses of Al and Ag.\n\nLet me denote the density of aluminum as \u03c1_Al and silver as \u03c1_Ag. But wait, the problem says silver is twice as heavy as aluminum. So does that mean the density of silver is twice that of aluminum? Or the mass per unit volume?\n\nYes, I think so. Because density is mass per unit volume. So if silver is twice as heavy (same volume), then \u03c1_Ag = 2 * \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo, each has volume V/2, but their masses are (V/2)*\u03c1_Al for Al and (V/2)*\u03c1_Ag for Ag.\n\nSo total mass is (V/2)(\u03c1_Al + 2 \u03c1_Al) = (V/2)(3 \u03c1_Al) = (3 V \u03c1_Al)/2.\n\nAnd this equals 30 grams.\n\nSo, 3 V \u03c1_Al / 2 = 30 grams.\n\nWait, I can solve for \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo, \u03c1_Al = (30 * 2) / (3 V) ) = 60/(3V) = 20 / V.\n\nWait, but I have V as the volume of the coin, which is 353.43 mm\u00b3. Wait, let me compute V numerically.\n\nWait, 15 mm diameter is 15 mm, so radius 7.5 mm. So area is \u03c0*(7.5)^2 = 56.25\u03c0 mm\u00b2. Thickness 2 mm. So volume is 56.25\u03c0 * 2 = 112.5 \u03c0 mm\u00b3. Let me compute that numerically. Pi is approximately 3.1416, so 112.5 * 3.1416 \u2248 353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nSo V = 353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nSo \u03c1_Al = 20 / (353.429) ? Wait wait, no. Wait, earlier equation: \u03c1_Al = (2 *30) / (3 V) ) = (60) / (3 V) ) = 20 / V.\n\nWait, substituting V as 353.429, so 20 / 353.429 \u2248 0.0566 g/mm\u00b3. Wait, that can't be right because the density of aluminum is about 2.7 g/cm\u00b3, which is 2.7 g per cm\u00b3, which is 2700 g/m\u00b3, or 2.7 g per cm\u00b3, which is 2.7 g per (10 mm)^3. So 1 mm\u00b3 is 1e-3 liters. So 1 cm\u00b3 is 1000 mm\u00b3. So 2.7 g/cm\u00b3 is 2.7 g per 1000 mm\u00b3, so 0.0027 g/mm\u00b3. Wait, but that's about 0.0027, but my calculation gave 0.0566 g/mm\u00b3 which is much higher. So I must have messed up the algebra.\n\nLet me go back. The total mass of the coin is 30 grams, which is equal to (V/2)*\u03c1_Al + (V/2)*\u03c1_Ag.\n\nBut since \u03c1_Ag = 2 \u03c1_Al, that's (V/2) (\u03c1_Al + 2 \u03c1_Al )= (V/2)(3 \u03c1_Al) = (3 V \u03c1_Al ) / 2.\n\nSo 3 V \u03c1_Al /2 = 30 grams.\n\nSo \u03c1_Al = (30 * 2) / (3 V ) = 60/(3 V) = 20/(V).\n\nWait, but V is 353.429 mm\u00b3, so 20 / 353.429 \u2248 0.0566 g/mm\u00b3.\n\nWait, but as I thought earlier, that's about 56.6 g/cm\u00b3, which is way too high. Because aluminum's density is about 2.7 g/cm\u00b3, which is 2700 kg/m\u00b3, or 2.7 g per cm\u00b3.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let's double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should work in cm\u00b3 instead of mm\u00b3 because the density is often given in g/cm\u00b3.\n\nSo, 1 mm = 0.1 cm. So 1 mm\u00b3 = (0.1 cm)^3 = 0.001 cm\u00b3 = 1e-3 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo the volume of the first coin is 353.429 mm\u00b3 = 353.429 * 1e-3 cm\u00b3 = 0.353429 cm\u00b3.\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, V is 0.353429 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo, \u03c1_Al = 20 / V.\n\nWait, but V is in cm\u00b3 now. So V is 0.353429 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo \u03c1_Al = 20 / 0.353429 \u2248 56.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nWait, that's way too high. Because aluminum's density is about 2.7 g/cm\u00b3. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial equation.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the setup.\n\nThe first coin's volume is V = 353.429 mm\u00b3. So 353.429 mm\u00b3 = 0.353429 cm\u00b3.\n\nEach component (Al and Ag) has a volume of V/2 = 0.1767145 cm\u00b3.\n\nMass of Al is volume * density, so 0.1767145 cm\u00b3 * \u03c1_Al.\n\nMass of Ag is 0.1767145 cm\u00b3 * \u03c1_Ag.\n\nTotal mass is 30 grams.\n\nSo 0.1767145 * (\u03c1_Al + \u03c1_Ag) = 30.\n\nBut \u03c1_Ag = 2 * \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo substituting: 0.1767145 * (\u03c1_Al + 2 \u03c1_Al ) = 30 \u2192 0.1767145 *3 \u03c1_Al =30.\n\nSo 3 * 0.1767145 * \u03c1_Al = 30 \u2192 0.5301435 * \u03c1_Al =30 \u2192 \u03c1_Al = 30 / 0.5301435 \u2248 56.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nWait, that's impossible because aluminum's density is about 2.7 g/cm\u00b3. So perhaps I messed up the units again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute everything in grams and mm\u00b3. Let me try again.\n\nSo, volume of the first coin is V = 353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nEach metal is V/2 = 176.7145 mm\u00b3.\n\nMass of Al is 176.7145 * \u03c1_Al (g/mm\u00b3).\n\nMass of Ag is 176.7145 * \u03c1_Ag (g/mm\u00b3).\n\nTotal mass is 30 grams.\n\nSo 176.7145 (\u03c1_Al + \u03c1_Ag) = 30.\n\nBut \u03c1_Ag = 2 \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo 176.7145 * 3 \u03c1_Al =30 \u2192 \u03c1_Al = 30 / (3 * 176.7145) = 30/(530.1435) \u2248 0.0566 g/mm\u00b3.\n\nWait, 0.0566 g/mm\u00b3 is equal to 56.6 g/cm\u00b3, which is again way too high. So something's wrong here. Because aluminum's density is 2.7 g/cm\u00b3, which is 0.0027 g/mm\u00b3.\n\nWait, maybe the initial assumption about the ratio is wrong. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem states that the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver. So the volume of Al is equal to the volume of Ag. So each is V/2.\n\nBut the problem also says that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum. Wait, does that mean that the mass of silver is twice that of aluminum for the same volume, or that silver's density is twice that of aluminum's?\n\nBecause if the density of silver is twice that of aluminum, then for the same volume, Ag has twice the mass. So that makes sense.\n\nSo, perhaps the mistake is in the setup.\n\nWait, I think the setup is correct. Let me think about the first calculation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the first coin's volume is correct, but when I'm calculating \u03c1_Al, I'm getting a value that's way higher than the actual. So perhaps I should find the density of aluminum in the correct units.\n\nWait, let me compute the densities correctly.\n\nLet me denote the density of aluminum as \u03c1_Al and silver as \u03c1_Ag.\n\nWe know that \u03c1_Ag = 2 \u03c1_Al.\n\nWe have for the first coin:\n\nmass = (V/2) * \u03c1_Al + (V/2) * \u03c1_Ag = 30 grams.\n\nSubstituting \u03c1_Ag = 2 \u03c1_Al:\n\nmass = (V/2)(\u03c1_Al + 2 \u03c1_Al) ) = (V/2)(3 \u03c1_Al) ) = (3 V \u03c1_Al ) / 2.\n\nSo 3 V \u03c1_Al / 2 = 30 \u2192 \u03c1_Al = (30 *2 )/(3 V) )= 60/(3 V) = 20 / V.\n\nWait, V is in mm\u00b3? Or cm\u00b3?\n\nBecause if V is in cm\u00b3, then the calculation would be different.\n\nWait, V is the volume of the coin, which is 353.429 mm\u00b3, which is 0.353429 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo 20 / V (in cm\u00b3) \u2192 20 / 0.353429 \u2248 56.6 g/cm\u00b3. That's way higher than the actual 2.7 g/cm\u00b3. So that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the way I'm setting up the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me find the densities of Al and Ag.\n\nGiven that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum. So if Al has density \u03c1, Ag has 2\u03c1.\n\nThe first coin's volume is V, with half Al and half Ag.\n\nSo the mass is (V/2)*\u03c1 + (V/2)*2\u03c1 = (V/2)(\u03c1 + 2\u03c1) = (3 V \u03c1)/2 = 30 grams.\n\nSo 3 V \u03c1 / 2 =30 \u2192 3 V \u03c1 =60 \u2192 V \u03c1 =20 \u2192 \u03c1=20/(V).\n\nWait, but I need to find \u03c1 in correct units. Let me compute V in cm\u00b3.\n\nV= (\u03c0*(7.5 mm)^2)*2 mm = \u03c0 * 56.25 mm\u00b2 *2 mm = 112.5 \u03c0 mm\u00b3 \u2248 353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nConvert to cm\u00b3: 353.429 mm\u00b3 = 0.353429 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo \u03c1=20/(0.353429) \u224856.6 g/cm\u00b3. But that's impossible because Al's density is 2.7 g/cm\u00b3. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm calculating the volume.\n\nWait, wait a second. The volume of the coin is 2 mm thick. Let me compute that correctly.\n\nWait, the diameter is 15 mm, so radius 7.5 mm. The area is \u03c0 r\u00b2 = \u03c0*(7.5)^2 = 56.25 \u03c0 mm\u00b2. The thickness is 2 mm, so volume is 56.25 \u03c0 * 2 = 112.5 \u03c0 mm\u00b3.\n\nWait, 112.5 \u03c0 is approximately 353.429 mm\u00b3, which is 0.353429 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo if I substitute V = 0.353429 cm\u00b3 into the equation, I get \u03c1 =20 /0.353429 \u224856.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nBut this is way too high. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is not 2:1 in mass but in volume. Wait, no, the problem states that the volume of aluminum equals that of silver. So that part is correct.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps instead of working with the first coin, I can find the density of the alloy, then use that to find the properties needed for the second coin.\n\nWait, the first coin's total volume is V, with V/2 Al and V/2 Ag.\n\nThe mass is 30 grams.\n\nSo, mass = (V/2) (\u03c1_Al + \u03c1_Ag) ) =30.\n\nBut \u03c1_Ag = 2 \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo, (V/2)(3 \u03c1_Al )=30 \u2192 V * (3 \u03c1_Al )=60 \u2192 V \u03c1_Al =20 \u2192 \u03c1_Al =20 / V.\n\nSo, same as before. So perhaps I should proceed with the calculation and see where it goes.\n\nWait, but if I proceed with this, I'll get an incorrect density for aluminum. So perhaps I'm missing something in the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should find the density of the alloy and then find the density of aluminum.\n\nWait, the alloy is 50% Al and 50% Ag by volume. So the average density would be ( (V/2) \u03c1_Al + (V/2) \u03c1_Ag ) / V = ( (\u03c1_Al + \u03c1_Ag) ) / 2.\n\nBut since \u03c1_Ag = 2 \u03c1_Al, then average density = (\u03c1_Al + 2 \u03c1_Al ) / 2 = (3 \u03c1_Al ) / 2.\n\nSo, the alloy's density is (3/2) \u03c1_Al.\n\nThe mass of the alloy is 30 grams, volume V. So, 30 = V * (3/2 \u03c1_Al ) \u2192 30 = (3/2) V \u03c1_Al \u2192 \u03c1_Al = (30 *2 )/(3 V )= 20 / V.\n\nSame as before.\n\nHmm. Perhaps I should just proceed with the calculation, even though the numbers seem off, and see what happens.\n\nNow, the second coin is made of pure aluminum, measures 1 mm thick and 30 mm diameter.\n\nSo, its volume is V2 = \u03c0 * (15 mm)^2 *1 mm = \u03c0*(225) *1 = 225 \u03c0 mm\u00b3 \u2248 706.858 mm\u00b3.\n\nWhich is 0.706858 cm\u00b3.\n\nIf it's pure aluminum, its mass would be V2 * \u03c1_Al.\n\nBut we have \u03c1_Al =20 / V, where V is 0.353429 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo, \u03c1_Al =20 /0.353429 \u224856.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nSo mass = 0.706858 cm\u00b3 *56.6 g/cm\u00b3 \u224840.3 grams.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is B)40 grams.\n\nWait, but this can't be right because aluminum's density is 2.7 g/cm\u00b3, which would make the mass of the second coin 0.706858 * 2.7 \u22481.908 grams, which isn't matching the options. So clearly, there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe I'm mixing up the way I calculate the densities.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the mass of the first coin correctly.\n\nThe first coin's volume is V = 353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nIt's 50% Al and 50% Ag by volume.\n\nSo, mass of Al = (V/2) * \u03c1_Al.\n\nMass of Ag = (V/2) * \u03c1_Ag.\n\nTotal mass =30 grams.\n\n\u03c1_Ag = 2 \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo,\n\n(V/2) (\u03c1_Al + 2 \u03c1_Al ) =30 \u2192 (3 V \u03c1_Al ) /2 =30 \u2192 V \u03c1_Al =20 \u2192 \u03c1_Al =20 / V.\n\nV is 353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nSo \u03c1_Al =20 /353.429 \u22480.0566 g/mm\u00b3.\n\nBut 0.0566 g/mm\u00b3 is 56.6 g/cm\u00b3, which is way off. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the unit conversion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute V in cm\u00b3 correctly.\n\nWait, 1 cm\u00b3 = (10 mm)^3 = 1000 mm\u00b3.\n\nSo, V =353.429 mm\u00b3 = 0.353429 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo, \u03c1_Al =20 /0.353429 \u224856.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nThat's wrong because Al is 2.7 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nHmm, perhaps the mistake is that the problem says the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, but maybe I should consider that the mass of the alloy is 30 grams, so perhaps I should find the densities correctly.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the problem in terms of mass fractions.\n\nWait, if the volume of Al and Ag are equal, but silver is twice as dense, then the mass of Ag would be twice that of Al for the same volume.\n\nSo, for the same volume, mass_Ag = 2 * mass_Al.\n\nSo, in the first coin, which is 50% Al and 50% Ag by volume, the mass of Ag is twice that of Al.\n\nSo, the total mass would be mass_Al + 2 * mass_Al =3 * mass_Al =30 grams.\n\nSo mass_Al =10 grams, mass_Ag=20 grams.\n\nWait, that makes sense because if the volumes are equal, and Ag is twice as dense, the mass of Ag would be twice that of Al.\n\nSo, the volume of Al is V/2, and its mass is 10 grams.\n\nSo, density of Al is mass/volume \u2192 10 g / (V/2) =20 / V.\n\nWait, but V is in cm\u00b3 or mm\u00b3?\n\nWait, V is the total volume of the first coin, which is 0.353429 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo, 10 grams is the mass of Al, which is (V/2) * \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo,\n\n10 g = (0.353429 cm\u00b3 / 2 ) * \u03c1_Al \u2192 10 = (0.1767145 ) * \u03c1_Al \u2192 \u03c1_Al =10 /0.1767145 \u224856.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nAgain, same issue. So this suggests that the way I'm setting up the problem is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm misinterpreting the \"twice as heavy\" part. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem states, \"silver is twice as heavy as aluminum.\" So, if two objects have the same volume, the silver one is twice as heavy as the aluminum one.\n\nSo, density of Ag is twice that of Al.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, \u03c1_Ag =2 \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo, back to the first approach. So, perhaps the issue is that the first calculation leads to an impossible density, which suggests that perhaps the approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the mass of the second coin in a different way.\n\nWait, the second coin is made of pure aluminum, so its mass is V2 * \u03c1_Al.\n\nWe need to find V2 and then multiply by \u03c1_Al.\n\nBut we need to find \u03c1_Al.\n\nBut from the first coin, we have 30 grams = (V/2) * (\u03c1_Al + 2 \u03c1_Al) )= (3 V \u03c1_Al ) /2.\n\nSo, 3 V \u03c1_Al =60 \u2192 V \u03c1_Al =20 \u2192 \u03c1_Al =20 / V.\n\nSo, with V=0.353429 cm\u00b3, \u03c1_Al =20/0.353429\u224856.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nBut that's wrong. So perhaps the mistake is that I'm using the same volume for the first coin in cm\u00b3, but perhaps I should compute everything in mm\u00b3.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nSo, V =353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nSo, 30 grams = (353.429 / 2) * (\u03c1_Al + 2 \u03c1_Al ) \u2192 30 = (176.7145) * (3 \u03c1_Al ) \u2192 30 =530.1435 * \u03c1_Al \u2192 \u03c1_Al =30 /530.1435 \u22480.0566 g/mm\u00b3.\n\nWhich is 56.6 g/cm\u00b3 again.\n\nWait, I'm stuck here. Maybe I should think about the ratio of the coins.\n\nWait, the second coin is 1 mm thick and 30 mm diameter. Let's compute its volume.\n\nVolume V2 = \u03c0*(15 mm)^2 *1 mm = \u03c0 *225 *1 =225 \u03c0 mm\u00b3 \u2248706.858 mm\u00b3.\n\nWhich is 0.706858 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo, mass of this coin would be V2 * \u03c1_Al.\n\nBut if \u03c1_Al is 56.6 g/cm\u00b3, then mass is 0.706858 *56.6 \u224840.3 grams. Which is option B, 40 grams.\n\nBut this can't be right because the density is way off. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the first coin's volume is correct, but I'm miscalculating the mass.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first coin's volume is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the thickness is 2 mm, which is the height, and diameter 15 mm.\n\nSo, the volume is \u03c0*(7.5)^2 *2 mm\u00b3 \u2192 112.5 \u03c0 mm\u00b3, which is correct.\n\nSo, I think perhaps the correct approach is to accept that the density of aluminum is 56.6 g/cm\u00b3, even though that's not correct, and proceed to find the answer as 40 grams.\n\nBut that can't be right because the real density is much lower.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the first coin.\n\nIt's an alloy with equal volumes of Al and Ag.\n\nThe total mass is 30 grams.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nV = volume of the coin = \u03c0*(7.5)^2 *2 mm\u00b3 = 353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nVolume of Al: V/2 =176.7145 mm\u00b3.\n\nVolume of Ag: V/2 =176.7145 mm\u00b3.\n\nMass of Al: m_Al = (V/2) * \u03c1_Al.\n\nMass of Ag: m_Ag = (V/2) * \u03c1_Ag.\n\nGiven that m_Al + m_Ag =30 grams.\n\nBut \u03c1_Ag = 2 \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo,\n\nm_Al = (176.7145 mm\u00b3) * \u03c1_Al.\n\nm_Ag = (176.7145 mm\u00b3) * 2 \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo,\n\nm_Al + m_Ag =176.7145 *3 \u03c1_Al =30 grams.\n\nSo,\n\n3 *176.7145 * \u03c1_Al =30 \u2192 530.1435 * \u03c1_Al =30 \u2192 \u03c1_Al =30/530.1435 \u22480.0566 g/mm\u00b3.\n\nWhich is 56.6 g/cm\u00b3, which is impossible. So perhaps the problem is that the approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the \"silver is twice as heavy as aluminum\" refers to mass per unit mass, not per unit volume. That can't be right because density is per unit volume.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the coin's volume is different.\n\nWait, wait a minute. The first coin's volume is 2 mm thick and 15 mm diameter. So the radius is 7.5 mm. So volume is \u03c0*(7.5)^2 *2 =112.5 \u03c0 mm\u00b3 \u2248353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut if I proceed with \u03c1_Al =0.0566 g/mm\u00b3, then the second coin's volume is 706.858 mm\u00b3.\n\nMass =706.858 mm\u00b3 *0.0566 g/mm\u00b3 \u224840.3 grams.\n\nWhich is option B.\n\nBut that can't be right because the real density is 2.7 g/cm\u00b3, which is 0.0027 g/mm\u00b3.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the ratio of the densities.\n\nWait, let me think about the first coin again.\n\nThe mass is 30 grams = (V/2) (\u03c1_Al + 2 \u03c1_Al ) = (3 V \u03c1_Al )/2.\n\nSo, 3 V \u03c1_Al =60 \u2192 V \u03c1_Al =20.\n\nBut the second coin is made of pure Al, so its mass is V2 * \u03c1_Al.\n\nBut V2 is the volume of the second coin.\n\nThe second coin's dimensions are 1 mm thick, 30 mm diameter.\n\nSo, radius is 15 mm. Volume is \u03c0*(15)^2 *1 =225 \u03c0 mm\u00b3 \u2248706.858 mm\u00b3.\n\nSo, V2 =706.858 mm\u00b3.\n\nWe can express the mass as V2 * \u03c1_Al.\n\nBut from the first equation, V * \u03c1_Al =20 grams. So, V=353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nSo, \u03c1_Al =20 / V =20 /353.429 \u22480.0566 g/mm\u00b3.\n\nSo, mass of the second coin is 706.858 *0.0566 \u224840.3 grams.\n\nSo, the answer would be B)40 grams.\n\nBut again, this seems to suggest that aluminum's density is way higher than it actually is, which can't be right. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem states that the volume of the alloy is the same as the volume of each metal, but perhaps the first coin's volume is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the mass of the second coin using the ratio.\n\nWait, let me think differently.\n\nThe first coin is an alloy of Al and Ag with equal volumes. So, the ratio of masses is 1:2 for Al:Ag.\n\nSo, in the first coin, mass of Al is 10 grams, Ag is 20 grams, totaling 30 grams.\n\nSo, the volume of Al is 10g / \u03c1_Al.\n\nThe volume of Ag is 20g / (2 \u03c1_Al )=10g / \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo, the total volume is (10/\u03c1_Al ) + (10/\u03c1_Al )=20 /\u03c1_Al.\n\nWhich is equal to the volume of the first coin, which is 353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nSo,\n\n20 /\u03c1_Al =353.429 \u2192 \u03c1_Al =20 /353.429 \u22480.0566 g/mm\u00b3 \u219256.6 g/cm\u00b3. Again, same issue.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is designed with incorrect densities, but I have to proceed.\n\nSo, the second coin's volume is 706.858 mm\u00b3. Mass is 706.858 *0.0566 \u224840.3 grams.\n\nSo, the closest option is B)40 grams.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about coins made of aluminum and silver alloys. Hmm, let me try to break it down.\n\nThe first coin is an alloy of aluminum and silver. It measures 2 mm thick and a diameter of 15 mm. The weight is 30 grams. Also, the volume of aluminum is equal to the volume of silver in the alloy. So, it's 50-50 by volume.\n\nWait, but the question is about a second coin. This one measures 1 mm thick and a diameter of 30 mm. It's made of pure aluminum. And the twist is that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum. We need to find the weight of this second coin.\n\nHmm, I think I need to find the densities or something. Because the weight depends on volume and density.\n\nLet me think. Since the first coin is an alloy with equal volumes of Al and Ag, each component is half the volume of the coin. So the total volume of the alloy is V = V_al + V_silver, but since they're equal, each is V/2.\n\nWait, but wait. The coin's volume is based on its dimensions. The first coin is 2mm thick, diameter 15mm. So the volume is area times thickness. The area is \u03c0r\u00b2. So radius is 15/2 =7.5 mm. So area is \u03c0*(7.5)^2 mm\u00b2. Thickness is 2 mm. So volume is \u03c0*(7.5)^2 *2 mm\u00b3. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, but I'll need to convert mm to meters if I'm working with SI units, but maybe I can work in grams and mm\u00b3 since the density would be in g/cm\u00b3 or similar.\n\nWait, let's compute the volume first.\n\nVolume of first coin: V = \u03c0*(d/2)^2 * t = \u03c0*(15/2)^2 *2 mm\u00b3.\n\n15 mm is 0.015 m? Wait, maybe better to compute in mm\u00b3.\n\nSo, V = \u03c0 * (7.5)^2 * 2 = \u03c0 * 56.25 *2 = \u03c0 * 112.5 mm\u00b3 \u2248 353.43 mm\u00b3.\n\nBut wait, the coin's volume is 353.43 mm\u00b3. But it's half aluminum and half silver by volume, so each has a volume of 176.715 mm\u00b3.\n\nWait, but the weight of the coin is 30 grams. So the total mass is 30 grams. But that's the sum of the masses of Al and Ag.\n\nLet me denote the density of aluminum as \u03c1_Al and silver as \u03c1_Ag. But wait, the problem says silver is twice as heavy as aluminum. So does that mean the density of silver is twice that of aluminum? Or the mass per unit volume?\n\nYes, I think so. Because density is mass per unit volume. So if silver is twice as heavy (same volume), then \u03c1_Ag = 2 * \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo, each has volume V/2, but their masses are (V/2)*\u03c1_Al for Al and (V/2)*\u03c1_Ag for Ag.\n\nSo total mass is (V/2)(\u03c1_Al + 2 \u03c1_Al) = (V/2)(3 \u03c1_Al) = (3 V \u03c1_Al)/2.\n\nAnd this equals 30 grams.\n\nSo, 3 V \u03c1_Al / 2 = 30 grams.\n\nWait, I can solve for \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo, \u03c1_Al = (30 * 2) / (3 V) ) = 60/(3V) = 20 / V.\n\nWait, but I have V as the volume of the coin, which is 353.43 mm\u00b3. Wait, let me compute V numerically.\n\nWait, 15 mm diameter is 15 mm, so radius 7.5 mm. So area is \u03c0*(7.5)^2 = 56.25\u03c0 mm\u00b2. Thickness 2 mm. So volume is 56.25\u03c0 * 2 = 112.5 \u03c0 mm\u00b3. Let me compute that numerically. Pi is approximately 3.1416, so 112.5 * 3.1416 \u2248 353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nSo V = 353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nSo \u03c1_Al = 20 / (353.429) ? Wait wait, no. Wait, earlier equation: \u03c1_Al = (2 *30) / (3 V) ) = (60) / (3 V) ) = 20 / V.\n\nWait, substituting V as 353.429, so 20 / 353.429 \u2248 0.0566 g/mm\u00b3. Wait, that can't be right because the density of aluminum is about 2.7 g/cm\u00b3, which is 2.7 g per cm\u00b3, which is 2700 g/m\u00b3, or 2.7 g per cm\u00b3, which is 2.7 g per (10 mm)^3. So 1 mm\u00b3 is 1e-3 liters. So 1 cm\u00b3 is 1000 mm\u00b3. So 2.7 g/cm\u00b3 is 2.7 g per 1000 mm\u00b3, so 0.0027 g/mm\u00b3. Wait, but that's about 0.0027, but my calculation gave 0.0566 g/mm\u00b3 which is much higher. So I must have messed up the algebra.\n\nLet me go back. The total mass of the coin is 30 grams, which is equal to (V/2)*\u03c1_Al + (V/2)*\u03c1_Ag.\n\nBut since \u03c1_Ag = 2 \u03c1_Al, that's (V/2) (\u03c1_Al + 2 \u03c1_Al )= (V/2)(3 \u03c1_Al) = (3 V \u03c1_Al ) / 2.\n\nSo 3 V \u03c1_Al /2 = 30 grams.\n\nSo \u03c1_Al = (30 * 2) / (3 V ) = 60/(3 V) = 20/(V).\n\nWait, but V is 353.429 mm\u00b3, so 20 / 353.429 \u2248 0.0566 g/mm\u00b3.\n\nWait, but as I thought earlier, that's about 56.6 g/cm\u00b3, which is way too high. Because aluminum's density is about 2.7 g/cm\u00b3, which is 2700 kg/m\u00b3, or 2.7 g per cm\u00b3.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let's double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should work in cm\u00b3 instead of mm\u00b3 because the density is often given in g/cm\u00b3.\n\nSo, 1 mm = 0.1 cm. So 1 mm\u00b3 = (0.1 cm)^3 = 0.001 cm\u00b3 = 1e-3 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo the volume of the first coin is 353.429 mm\u00b3 = 353.429 * 1e-3 cm\u00b3 = 0.353429 cm\u00b3.\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, V is 0.353429 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo, \u03c1_Al = 20 / V.\n\nWait, but V is in cm\u00b3 now. So V is 0.353429 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo \u03c1_Al = 20 / 0.353429 \u2248 56.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nWait, that's way too high. Because aluminum's density is about 2.7 g/cm\u00b3. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial equation.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the setup.\n\nThe first coin's volume is V = 353.429 mm\u00b3. So 353.429 mm\u00b3 = 0.353429 cm\u00b3.\n\nEach component (Al and Ag) has a volume of V/2 = 0.1767145 cm\u00b3.\n\nMass of Al is volume * density, so 0.1767145 cm\u00b3 * \u03c1_Al.\n\nMass of Ag is 0.1767145 cm\u00b3 * \u03c1_Ag.\n\nTotal mass is 30 grams.\n\nSo 0.1767145 * (\u03c1_Al + \u03c1_Ag) = 30.\n\nBut \u03c1_Ag = 2 * \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo substituting: 0.1767145 * (\u03c1_Al + 2 \u03c1_Al ) = 30 \u2192 0.1767145 *3 \u03c1_Al =30.\n\nSo 3 * 0.1767145 * \u03c1_Al = 30 \u2192 0.5301435 * \u03c1_Al =30 \u2192 \u03c1_Al = 30 / 0.5301435 \u2248 56.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nWait, that's impossible because aluminum's density is about 2.7 g/cm\u00b3. So perhaps I messed up the units again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute everything in grams and mm\u00b3. Let me try again.\n\nSo, volume of the first coin is V = 353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nEach metal is V/2 = 176.7145 mm\u00b3.\n\nMass of Al is 176.7145 * \u03c1_Al (g/mm\u00b3).\n\nMass of Ag is 176.7145 * \u03c1_Ag (g/mm\u00b3).\n\nTotal mass is 30 grams.\n\nSo 176.7145 (\u03c1_Al + \u03c1_Ag) = 30.\n\nBut \u03c1_Ag = 2 \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo 176.7145 * 3 \u03c1_Al =30 \u2192 \u03c1_Al = 30 / (3 * 176.7145) = 30/(530.1435) \u2248 0.0566 g/mm\u00b3.\n\nWait, 0.0566 g/mm\u00b3 is equal to 56.6 g/cm\u00b3, which is again way too high. So something's wrong here. Because aluminum's density is 2.7 g/cm\u00b3, which is 0.0027 g/mm\u00b3.\n\nWait, maybe the initial assumption about the ratio is wrong. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem states that the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver. So the volume of Al is equal to the volume of Ag. So each is V/2.\n\nBut the problem also says that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum. Wait, does that mean that the mass of silver is twice that of aluminum for the same volume, or that silver's density is twice that of aluminum's?\n\nBecause if the density of silver is twice that of aluminum, then for the same volume, Ag has twice the mass. So that makes sense.\n\nSo, perhaps the mistake is in the setup.\n\nWait, I think the setup is correct. Let me think about the first calculation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the first coin's volume is correct, but when I'm calculating \u03c1_Al, I'm getting a value that's way higher than the actual. So perhaps I should find the density of aluminum in the correct units.\n\nWait, let me compute the densities correctly.\n\nLet me denote the density of aluminum as \u03c1_Al and silver as \u03c1_Ag.\n\nWe know that \u03c1_Ag = 2 \u03c1_Al.\n\nWe have for the first coin:\n\nmass = (V/2) * \u03c1_Al + (V/2) * \u03c1_Ag = 30 grams.\n\nSubstituting \u03c1_Ag = 2 \u03c1_Al:\n\nmass = (V/2)(\u03c1_Al + 2 \u03c1_Al) ) = (V/2)(3 \u03c1_Al) ) = (3 V \u03c1_Al ) / 2.\n\nSo 3 V \u03c1_Al / 2 = 30 \u2192 \u03c1_Al = (30 *2 )/(3 V) )= 60/(3 V) = 20 / V.\n\nWait, V is in mm\u00b3? Or cm\u00b3?\n\nBecause if V is in cm\u00b3, then the calculation would be different.\n\nWait, V is the volume of the coin, which is 353.429 mm\u00b3, which is 0.353429 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo 20 / V (in cm\u00b3) \u2192 20 / 0.353429 \u2248 56.6 g/cm\u00b3. That's way higher than the actual 2.7 g/cm\u00b3. So that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the way I'm setting up the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me find the densities of Al and Ag.\n\nGiven that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum. So if Al has density \u03c1, Ag has 2\u03c1.\n\nThe first coin's volume is V, with half Al and half Ag.\n\nSo the mass is (V/2)*\u03c1 + (V/2)*2\u03c1 = (V/2)(\u03c1 + 2\u03c1) = (3 V \u03c1)/2 = 30 grams.\n\nSo 3 V \u03c1 / 2 =30 \u2192 3 V \u03c1 =60 \u2192 V \u03c1 =20 \u2192 \u03c1=20/(V).\n\nWait, but I need to find \u03c1 in correct units. Let me compute V in cm\u00b3.\n\nV= (\u03c0*(7.5 mm)^2)*2 mm = \u03c0 * 56.25 mm\u00b2 *2 mm = 112.5 \u03c0 mm\u00b3 \u2248 353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nConvert to cm\u00b3: 353.429 mm\u00b3 = 0.353429 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo \u03c1=20/(0.353429) \u224856.6 g/cm\u00b3. But that's impossible because Al's density is 2.7 g/cm\u00b3. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm calculating the volume.\n\nWait, wait a second. The volume of the coin is 2 mm thick. Let me compute that correctly.\n\nWait, the diameter is 15 mm, so radius 7.5 mm. The area is \u03c0 r\u00b2 = \u03c0*(7.5)^2 = 56.25 \u03c0 mm\u00b2. The thickness is 2 mm, so volume is 56.25 \u03c0 * 2 = 112.5 \u03c0 mm\u00b3.\n\nWait, 112.5 \u03c0 is approximately 353.429 mm\u00b3, which is 0.353429 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo if I substitute V = 0.353429 cm\u00b3 into the equation, I get \u03c1 =20 /0.353429 \u224856.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nBut this is way too high. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is not 2:1 in mass but in volume. Wait, no, the problem states that the volume of aluminum equals that of silver. So that part is correct.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps instead of working with the first coin, I can find the density of the alloy, then use that to find the properties needed for the second coin.\n\nWait, the first coin's total volume is V, with V/2 Al and V/2 Ag.\n\nThe mass is 30 grams.\n\nSo, mass = (V/2) (\u03c1_Al + \u03c1_Ag) ) =30.\n\nBut \u03c1_Ag = 2 \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo, (V/2)(3 \u03c1_Al )=30 \u2192 V * (3 \u03c1_Al )=60 \u2192 V \u03c1_Al =20 \u2192 \u03c1_Al =20 / V.\n\nSo, same as before. So perhaps I should proceed with the calculation and see where it goes.\n\nWait, but if I proceed with this, I'll get an incorrect density for aluminum. So perhaps I'm missing something in the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should find the density of the alloy and then find the density of aluminum.\n\nWait, the alloy is 50% Al and 50% Ag by volume. So the average density would be ( (V/2) \u03c1_Al + (V/2) \u03c1_Ag ) / V = ( (\u03c1_Al + \u03c1_Ag) ) / 2.\n\nBut since \u03c1_Ag = 2 \u03c1_Al, then average density = (\u03c1_Al + 2 \u03c1_Al ) / 2 = (3 \u03c1_Al ) / 2.\n\nSo, the alloy's density is (3/2) \u03c1_Al.\n\nThe mass of the alloy is 30 grams, volume V. So, 30 = V * (3/2 \u03c1_Al ) \u2192 30 = (3/2) V \u03c1_Al \u2192 \u03c1_Al = (30 *2 )/(3 V )= 20 / V.\n\nSame as before.\n\nHmm. Perhaps I should just proceed with the calculation, even though the numbers seem off, and see what happens.\n\nNow, the second coin is made of pure aluminum, measures 1 mm thick and 30 mm diameter.\n\nSo, its volume is V2 = \u03c0 * (15 mm)^2 *1 mm = \u03c0*(225) *1 = 225 \u03c0 mm\u00b3 \u2248 706.858 mm\u00b3.\n\nWhich is 0.706858 cm\u00b3.\n\nIf it's pure aluminum, its mass would be V2 * \u03c1_Al.\n\nBut we have \u03c1_Al =20 / V, where V is 0.353429 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo, \u03c1_Al =20 /0.353429 \u224856.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nSo mass = 0.706858 cm\u00b3 *56.6 g/cm\u00b3 \u224840.3 grams.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is B)40 grams.\n\nWait, but this can't be right because aluminum's density is 2.7 g/cm\u00b3, which would make the mass of the second coin 0.706858 * 2.7 \u22481.908 grams, which isn't matching the options. So clearly, there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe I'm mixing up the way I calculate the densities.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the mass of the first coin correctly.\n\nThe first coin's volume is V = 353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nIt's 50% Al and 50% Ag by volume.\n\nSo, mass of Al = (V/2) * \u03c1_Al.\n\nMass of Ag = (V/2) * \u03c1_Ag.\n\nTotal mass =30 grams.\n\n\u03c1_Ag = 2 \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo,\n\n(V/2) (\u03c1_Al + 2 \u03c1_Al ) =30 \u2192 (3 V \u03c1_Al ) /2 =30 \u2192 V \u03c1_Al =20 \u2192 \u03c1_Al =20 / V.\n\nV is 353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nSo \u03c1_Al =20 /353.429 \u22480.0566 g/mm\u00b3.\n\nBut 0.0566 g/mm\u00b3 is 56.6 g/cm\u00b3, which is way off. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the unit conversion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute V in cm\u00b3 correctly.\n\nWait, 1 cm\u00b3 = (10 mm)^3 = 1000 mm\u00b3.\n\nSo, V =353.429 mm\u00b3 = 0.353429 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo, \u03c1_Al =20 /0.353429 \u224856.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nThat's wrong because Al is 2.7 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nHmm, perhaps the mistake is that the problem says the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, but maybe I should consider that the mass of the alloy is 30 grams, so perhaps I should find the densities correctly.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the problem in terms of mass fractions.\n\nWait, if the volume of Al and Ag are equal, but silver is twice as dense, then the mass of Ag would be twice that of Al for the same volume.\n\nSo, for the same volume, mass_Ag = 2 * mass_Al.\n\nSo, in the first coin, which is 50% Al and 50% Ag by volume, the mass of Ag is twice that of Al.\n\nSo, the total mass would be mass_Al + 2 * mass_Al =3 * mass_Al =30 grams.\n\nSo mass_Al =10 grams, mass_Ag=20 grams.\n\nWait, that makes sense because if the volumes are equal, and Ag is twice as dense, the mass of Ag would be twice that of Al.\n\nSo, the volume of Al is V/2, and its mass is 10 grams.\n\nSo, density of Al is mass/volume \u2192 10 g / (V/2) =20 / V.\n\nWait, but V is in cm\u00b3 or mm\u00b3?\n\nWait, V is the total volume of the first coin, which is 0.353429 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo, 10 grams is the mass of Al, which is (V/2) * \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo,\n\n10 g = (0.353429 cm\u00b3 / 2 ) * \u03c1_Al \u2192 10 = (0.1767145 ) * \u03c1_Al \u2192 \u03c1_Al =10 /0.1767145 \u224856.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nAgain, same issue. So this suggests that the way I'm setting up the problem is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm misinterpreting the \"twice as heavy\" part. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem states, \"silver is twice as heavy as aluminum.\" So, if two objects have the same volume, the silver one is twice as heavy as the aluminum one.\n\nSo, density of Ag is twice that of Al.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, \u03c1_Ag =2 \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo, back to the first approach. So, perhaps the issue is that the first calculation leads to an impossible density, which suggests that perhaps the approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the mass of the second coin in a different way.\n\nWait, the second coin is made of pure aluminum, so its mass is V2 * \u03c1_Al.\n\nWe need to find V2 and then multiply by \u03c1_Al.\n\nBut we need to find \u03c1_Al.\n\nBut from the first coin, we have 30 grams = (V/2) * (\u03c1_Al + 2 \u03c1_Al) )= (3 V \u03c1_Al ) /2.\n\nSo, 3 V \u03c1_Al =60 \u2192 V \u03c1_Al =20 \u2192 \u03c1_Al =20 / V.\n\nSo, with V=0.353429 cm\u00b3, \u03c1_Al =20/0.353429\u224856.6 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nBut that's wrong. So perhaps the mistake is that I'm using the same volume for the first coin in cm\u00b3, but perhaps I should compute everything in mm\u00b3.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nSo, V =353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nSo, 30 grams = (353.429 / 2) * (\u03c1_Al + 2 \u03c1_Al ) \u2192 30 = (176.7145) * (3 \u03c1_Al ) \u2192 30 =530.1435 * \u03c1_Al \u2192 \u03c1_Al =30 /530.1435 \u22480.0566 g/mm\u00b3.\n\nWhich is 56.6 g/cm\u00b3 again.\n\nWait, I'm stuck here. Maybe I should think about the ratio of the coins.\n\nWait, the second coin is 1 mm thick and 30 mm diameter. Let's compute its volume.\n\nVolume V2 = \u03c0*(15 mm)^2 *1 mm = \u03c0 *225 *1 =225 \u03c0 mm\u00b3 \u2248706.858 mm\u00b3.\n\nWhich is 0.706858 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo, mass of this coin would be V2 * \u03c1_Al.\n\nBut if \u03c1_Al is 56.6 g/cm\u00b3, then mass is 0.706858 *56.6 \u224840.3 grams. Which is option B, 40 grams.\n\nBut this can't be right because the density is way off. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the first coin's volume is correct, but I'm miscalculating the mass.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first coin's volume is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the thickness is 2 mm, which is the height, and diameter 15 mm.\n\nSo, the volume is \u03c0*(7.5)^2 *2 mm\u00b3 \u2192 112.5 \u03c0 mm\u00b3, which is correct.\n\nSo, I think perhaps the correct approach is to accept that the density of aluminum is 56.6 g/cm\u00b3, even though that's not correct, and proceed to find the answer as 40 grams.\n\nBut that can't be right because the real density is much lower.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the first coin.\n\nIt's an alloy with equal volumes of Al and Ag.\n\nThe total mass is 30 grams.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nV = volume of the coin = \u03c0*(7.5)^2 *2 mm\u00b3 = 353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nVolume of Al: V/2 =176.7145 mm\u00b3.\n\nVolume of Ag: V/2 =176.7145 mm\u00b3.\n\nMass of Al: m_Al = (V/2) * \u03c1_Al.\n\nMass of Ag: m_Ag = (V/2) * \u03c1_Ag.\n\nGiven that m_Al + m_Ag =30 grams.\n\nBut \u03c1_Ag = 2 \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo,\n\nm_Al = (176.7145 mm\u00b3) * \u03c1_Al.\n\nm_Ag = (176.7145 mm\u00b3) * 2 \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo,\n\nm_Al + m_Ag =176.7145 *3 \u03c1_Al =30 grams.\n\nSo,\n\n3 *176.7145 * \u03c1_Al =30 \u2192 530.1435 * \u03c1_Al =30 \u2192 \u03c1_Al =30/530.1435 \u22480.0566 g/mm\u00b3.\n\nWhich is 56.6 g/cm\u00b3, which is impossible. So perhaps the problem is that the approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the \"silver is twice as heavy as aluminum\" refers to mass per unit mass, not per unit volume. That can't be right because density is per unit volume.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the coin's volume is different.\n\nWait, wait a minute. The first coin's volume is 2 mm thick and 15 mm diameter. So the radius is 7.5 mm. So volume is \u03c0*(7.5)^2 *2 =112.5 \u03c0 mm\u00b3 \u2248353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut if I proceed with \u03c1_Al =0.0566 g/mm\u00b3, then the second coin's volume is 706.858 mm\u00b3.\n\nMass =706.858 mm\u00b3 *0.0566 g/mm\u00b3 \u224840.3 grams.\n\nWhich is option B.\n\nBut that can't be right because the real density is 2.7 g/cm\u00b3, which is 0.0027 g/mm\u00b3.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the ratio of the densities.\n\nWait, let me think about the first coin again.\n\nThe mass is 30 grams = (V/2) (\u03c1_Al + 2 \u03c1_Al ) = (3 V \u03c1_Al )/2.\n\nSo, 3 V \u03c1_Al =60 \u2192 V \u03c1_Al =20.\n\nBut the second coin is made of pure Al, so its mass is V2 * \u03c1_Al.\n\nBut V2 is the volume of the second coin.\n\nThe second coin's dimensions are 1 mm thick, 30 mm diameter.\n\nSo, radius is 15 mm. Volume is \u03c0*(15)^2 *1 =225 \u03c0 mm\u00b3 \u2248706.858 mm\u00b3.\n\nSo, V2 =706.858 mm\u00b3.\n\nWe can express the mass as V2 * \u03c1_Al.\n\nBut from the first equation, V * \u03c1_Al =20 grams. So, V=353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nSo, \u03c1_Al =20 / V =20 /353.429 \u22480.0566 g/mm\u00b3.\n\nSo, mass of the second coin is 706.858 *0.0566 \u224840.3 grams.\n\nSo, the answer would be B)40 grams.\n\nBut again, this seems to suggest that aluminum's density is way higher than it actually is, which can't be right. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem states that the volume of the alloy is the same as the volume of each metal, but perhaps the first coin's volume is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the mass of the second coin using the ratio.\n\nWait, let me think differently.\n\nThe first coin is an alloy of Al and Ag with equal volumes. So, the ratio of masses is 1:2 for Al:Ag.\n\nSo, in the first coin, mass of Al is 10 grams, Ag is 20 grams, totaling 30 grams.\n\nSo, the volume of Al is 10g / \u03c1_Al.\n\nThe volume of Ag is 20g / (2 \u03c1_Al )=10g / \u03c1_Al.\n\nSo, the total volume is (10/\u03c1_Al ) + (10/\u03c1_Al )=20 /\u03c1_Al.\n\nWhich is equal to the volume of the first coin, which is 353.429 mm\u00b3.\n\nSo,\n\n20 /\u03c1_Al =353.429 \u2192 \u03c1_Al =20 /353.429 \u22480.0566 g/mm\u00b3 \u219256.6 g/cm\u00b3. Again, same issue.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is designed with incorrect densities, but I have to proceed.\n\nSo, the second coin's volume is 706.858 mm\u00b3. Mass is 706.858 *0.0566 \u224840.3 grams.\n\nSo, the closest option is B)40 grams.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the alloy coin and the pure aluminum coin step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the alloy coin\nThe alloy coin has dimensions:\n- Thickness = 2 mm  \n- Diameter = 15 mm \u2192 Radius = 7.5 mm  \n\nThe volume of the alloy coin is calculated as:  \n\\[\nV_{\\text{alloy}} = \\pi r^2 t = \\pi (7.5)^2 (2) = 112.5 \\pi \\, \\text{mm}^3 \\approx 353.429 \\, \\text{mm}^3\n\\]\n\nThe problem states that the alloy is 50% aluminum (Al) and 50% silver (Ag) by volume. Thus:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{Al}} = V_{\\text{Ag}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{alloy}}}{2} = \\frac{353.429}{2} \\approx 176.7145 \\, \\text{mm}^3\n\\]\n\nThe total mass of the alloy coin is 30 grams. Since the densities of Al and Ag are related by \\(\\rho_{\\text{Ag}} = 2 \\rho_{\\text{Al}}\\), the total mass can be expressed as:\n\\[\nm_{\\text{Al}} + m_{\\text{Ag}} = 30 \\, \\text{g}\n\\]\n\\[\nm_{\\text{Al}} = V_{\\text{Al}} \\cdot \\rho_{\\text{Al}}, \\quad m_{\\text{Ag}} = V_{\\text{Ag}} \\cdot \\rho_{\\text{Ag}}\n\\]\n\\[\nm_{\\text{Al}} + m_{\\text{Ag}} = V_{\\text{Al}} \\cdot \\rho_{\\text{Al}} + V_{\\text{Ag}} \\cdot (2 \\rho_{\\text{Al}})\n\\]\n\\[\n30 = (176.7145) \\cdot \\rho_{\\text{Al}} + (176.7145) \\cdot (2 \\rho_{\\text{Al}})\n\\]\n\\[\n30 = (176.7145) \\cdot (3 \\rho_{\\text{Al}})\n\\]\n\\[\n\\rho_{\\text{Al}} = \\frac{30}{3 \\cdot 176.7145} \\approx 0.0566 \\, \\text{g/mm}^3\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the pure aluminum coin\nThe pure aluminum coin has dimensions:\n- Thickness = 1 mm  \n- Diameter = 30 mm \u2192 Radius = 15 mm  \n\nThe volume of the pure aluminum coin is:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{pure}} = \\pi r^2 t = \\pi (15)^2 (1) = 225 \\pi \\, \\text{mm}^3 \\approx 706.858 \\, \\text{mm}^3\n\\]\n\nThe mass of the pure aluminum coin is:\n\\[\nm_{\\text{pure}} = V_{\\text{pure}} \\cdot \\rho_{\\text{Al}}\n\\]\n\\[\nm_{\\text{pure}} = 706.858 \\cdot 0.0566 \\approx 40.3 \\, \\text{g}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Match the closest option\nThe calculated mass of the pure aluminum coin is approximately \\(40.3 \\, \\text{g}\\), which corresponds to option **B) 40 grams**.\n\nAnswer: B",
