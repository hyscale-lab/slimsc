      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about probability and relatively prime numbers. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nThe question says that set S contains integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen number from S is relatively prime to 1,000. Relatively prime means that the two numbers share no common positive factors other than 1, right?\n\nSo, probability is about favorable outcomes over total outcomes. The total outcomes here are straightforward\u2014since S has numbers from 1 to 1000, there are 1000 possible choices. So the denominator in my probability fraction is 1000.\n\nNow, the tricky part is figuring out the numerator\u2014the number of integers in S that are relatively prime to 1000. I remember something called Euler's Totient Function, which gives the count of numbers less than or equal to a given number that are coprime to it. Oh yeah, Euler's totient function \u03c6(n) gives exactly that count.\n\nSo, I need to calculate \u03c6(1000). To do that, I should factorize 1000 into its prime factors. Let me think, 1000 is 10 cubed, right? 10 is 2 times 5. So 1000 is 2^3 * 5^3. So the prime factors are 2 and 5.\n\nEuler's totient function for a number n = p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... * pn^kn is given by \u03c6(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pn). So applying that to 1000, which is 2^3 *5^3, we get:\n\n\u03c6(1000) = 1000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5)\nLet me compute that. (1-1/2) is 1/2, and (1-1/5) is 4/5.\n\nSo 1000 * (1/2) = 500. Then 500 * (4/5) = 500 * 0.8 = 400.\n\nWait, wait, wait. So \u03c6(1000) is 400. That means there are 400 numbers between 1 and 1000 that are relatively prime to 1000. So the number of favorable outcomes is 400.\n\nSo the probability is 400 / 1000. Simplify that, it's 4/10, which reduces to 2/5. Wait, no, 400 divided by 1000 is 0.4, which is 2/5. But wait, looking at the options, option D is 2/5. Hmm, but wait a second\u2014did I do the calculation right?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me double-check the \u03c6(1000) calculation. 1000 is 2^3 * 5^3. So \u03c6(1000) = 1000 * (1-1/2) * (1-1/5) = 1000 * 0.5 * 0.8 = 1000 * 0.4 = 400. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The probability is 400/1000 = 0.4 = 2/5. So the answer should be D) 2/5.\n\nBut looking back at the options, the choices are A)5/7, B)3/5, C)4/7, D)2/5, E)2/7. So D is 2/5, which is 0.4, matching my calculation.\n\nWait a second, I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 3/5. Did I make a mistake? Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the totient function. Let me recount. 1000 is 2^3 *5^3. So \u03c6(1000) = 1000 * (1-1/2) * (1-1/5) = 1000 * (1/2) * (4/5) = 1000 * (2/5) = 400. Oh, right, that's correct. So the probability is 400/1000 = 0.4 = 2/5. So the answer is D.\n\nBut wait, another thought. Wait, the question says numbers from 1 to 1000 inclusive. So 1000 is included. But 1000 is not coprime with itself, since their GCD is 1000. So the count of numbers coprime to 1000 is indeed 400. So 400/1000 is 2/5.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit shaky because I thought maybe the answer was 3/5. Maybe I got confused with another problem. No, wait, in this case, the totient function gives exactly 400. So 400/1000 is 2/5, which is 0.4.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D) 2/5.\n",

Two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. \n\nUsing Euler's Totient Function (\\( \\phi(n) \\)), which gives the number of integers less than or equal to \\( n \\) that are coprime to \\( n \\), we can find the count of such numbers. The prime factorization of 1000 is \\( 2^3 \\times 5^3 \\). The formula for \\( \\phi(n) \\) when \\( n \\) is factored into its prime components is:\n\n\\[\n\\phi(n) = n \\times \\prod_{p \\mid n} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p}\\right)\n\\]\n\nApplying this to \\( n = 1000 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\phi(1000) = 1000 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\phi(1000) = 1000 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{5}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\phi(1000) = 1000 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.8 = 400\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 400 numbers between 1 and 1000 that are coprime with 1000. The probability is then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\phi(1000)}{1000} = \\frac{400}{1000} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\nTo verify, we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle. The count of numbers not coprime with 1000 is the number of multiples of 2 or 5 in the range. The number of multiples of 2 is \\( \\frac{1000}{2} = 500 \\), the number of multiples of 5 is \\( \\frac{1000}{5} = 200 \\), and the number of multiples of both 2 and 5 (i.e., multiples of 10) is \\( \\frac{1000}{10} = 100 \\). Using inclusion-exclusion:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Count of numbers not coprime with 1000} = 500 + 200 - 100 = 600\n\\]\n\nThus, the count of numbers coprime with 1000 is:\n\n\\[\n1000 - 600 = 400\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that the probability is \\( \\frac{400}{1000} = \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n**Answer: D**",
