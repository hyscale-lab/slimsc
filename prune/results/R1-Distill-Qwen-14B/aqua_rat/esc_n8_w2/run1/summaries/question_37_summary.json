      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a shopkeeper selling a watch. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But if he gives a 7% discount instead, his profit is Rs. 15 less. I need to find the marked price of the watch.\n\nWait, let's think about what terms are given. The marked price is the original price before any discount. So, when the discount increases from 5% to 7%, the selling price decreases, which affects the profit. Oh right, because profit is calculated as selling price minus cost price. So the difference between the two selling prices (at 5% and 7% discounts) must be equal to the Rs. 15 loss in profit.\n\nLet me try to set this up. Let's denote the marked price as MP. The cost price, I think, is a fixed value. So, when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, the selling price is 95% of MP, right? Because 100% minus 5% discount is 95%. Similarly, a 7% discount would make the selling price 93% of MP.\n\nSo, the selling prices are 0.95*MP and 0.93*MP for the two cases. The difference between these two is Rs.15. Because when he gives a bigger discount (7%), he sells for less, so his profit is Rs.15 less than when he gives a 5% discount. So, the equation should be:\n\n0.95*MP - 0.93*MP = 15\n\nLet me calculate that. 0.95 minus 0.93 is 0.02. So, 0.02*MP = 15. So, MP equals 15 divided by 0.02. Let me do that math. 15 divided by 0.02 is 750. So the marked price is Rs. 750. Looking at the options, D is 750. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because the profit difference is Rs.15, which comes from the difference in selling prices. So, the difference in the selling prices is 0.02*MP =15, so MP is 750. That makes sense. So yes, D is the correct answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the marked price (MP) of the watch, let's analyze the problem:\n\n1. **Selling Prices with Discounts**:\n   - At a 5% discount, the selling price is \\( 0.95 \\times MP \\).\n   - At a 7% discount, the selling price is \\( 0.93 \\times MP \\).\n\n2. **Difference in Selling Prices**:\n   The difference between the two selling prices is given as Rs. 15.

Hmm, I remember that when you give a discount, the selling price decreases, which might affect the profit. \n\nAlright, let me read the problem again. The shopkeeper gives a 5% discount and sells the watch. But if he gives a 7% discount instead, his profit is Rs. 15 less. We need to find the marked price of the watch. The options are given, so maybe I can use them to check my answer later.\n\nWait, let's think about what variables we have. The marked price is the original price before any discount. Let's call that M. The cost price, which is the price the shopkeeper paid for the watch, is probably fixed, right? Because whether he sells it at a 5% or 7% discount, his cost doesn't change. So, his profit would be selling price minus cost price.\n\nSo, when he gives a 5% discount, the selling price is M minus 5% of M. That's 0.95*M. His profit in this case is 0.95*M - Cost Price.\n\nWhen he gives a 7% discount, the selling price is 0.93*M. His profit here would be 0.93*M - Cost Price. \n\nThe problem says that the profit when giving 7% discount is Rs. 15 less than when giving 5% discount. So, the difference between the two profits is 15. \n\nLet me write that as an equation. The profit at 5% discount minus profit at 7% discount equals 15. So:\n\n(0.95*M - CP) - (0.93*M - CP) = 15.\n\nWait, the Cost Price (CP) terms will cancel out. Let's see:\n\n0.95M - CP - 0.93M + CP = 15.\n\nSimplify that: (0.95M - 0.93M) = 15. \n\n0.02M = 15.\n\nSo, M is 15 divided by 0.02. Let me calculate that. 15 / 0.02 is the same as 15 * 50, which is 750. So M is 750.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 750. So the marked price should be D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's assume M is 750.\n\nAt 5% discount, selling price is 750 * 0.95 = 712.5. Profit is 712.5 - CP.\n\nAt 7% discount, selling price is 750 * 0.93 = 697.5. Profit is 697.5 - CP.\n\nThe difference between the two profits is (712.5 - CP) - (697.5 - CP) = 712.5 - 697.5 = 15. That matches the condition given. So yes, M=750 is correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer is D.\n",
