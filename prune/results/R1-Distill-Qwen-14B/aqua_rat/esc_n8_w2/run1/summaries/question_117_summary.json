      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about A, B, and C starting a business together, and I need to figure out how many months after B joined did C join. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the problem again carefully. A starts with Rs.40,000. Then, after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then, C joins after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nWait, the time periods are crucial here because profit sharing in partnerships is based on the time each person's investment was in the business and the amount invested. So, the longer someone's money is in the business, the more they earn.\n\nLet me outline the timeline. A starts first. Let's say the total time is 12 months because it's a year.\n\nA invested Rs.40,000 from the start, so for 12 months.\n\nB joined after 2 months, so B's investment period is 12 - 2 = 10 months.\n\nC joined after B, but I don't know when exactly. Let's denote the number of months after B joined that C joined as x. So, C's investment period would be (10 - x) months? Wait, no, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. Let me think of the entire year as 12 months.\n\nA started at month 0. So, A's investment is for 12 months.\n\nB joined at month 2. So B's investment is for (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n\nC joined after B, so let's say C joined at month (2 + x), where x is the number of months after B joined. So, C's investment period is (12 - (2 + x)) months. Simplify that: 10 - x months.\n\nWait, but wait. If C joined at (2 + x) months, then the time from C's joining to the end of the year is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the profit is divided in the ratio of their investments multiplied by the time they were invested.\n\nSo, the profit sharing ratio would be (A's investment * A's time) : (B's investment * B's time) : (C's investment * C's time).\n\nSo, the ratio is:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12\n\nB: 60,000 * 10\n\nC: 120,000 * (10 - x)\n\nWait, because C's time is 10 - x months? Let me confirm. If the year is 12 months, and C joined x months after B, who joined at month 2, then C joined at month (2 + x). So, the time C's money was in is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So, C's share is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 or 0.4, which is 40% of the total profit.\n\nAlternatively, the profit ratio is (A's part) : (B's part) : (C's part) = 40*12 : 60*10 : 120*(10 -x).\n\nWait, let's compute each part:\n\nA's part: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB's part: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000.\n\nC's part: 120,000 * (10 - x) = 1,200,000 * (10 - x)/10,000? Wait, no. Wait, 120,000 * (10 - x) is 120,000*(10 -x). Let's compute that as 1200000 - 120000x.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to factor out 10,000.\n\nSo, A's part: (40 *12) = 480.\n\nB's part: (60 *10) = 600.\n\nC's part: (120*(10 -x)) = 1200 - 120x.\n\nSo, the ratio is 480 : 600 : (1200 - 120x).\n\nNow, the total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So, the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 = 0.4, which is 40%.\n\nSo, the ratio of C's part to the sum of all parts is 0.4.\n\nSo, C's part is 0.4 of the total.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the ratio. Let me compute the sum of the ratios.\n\nSum = 480 + 600 + (1200 - 120x) = (480 + 600) is 1080, plus 1200 is 2280, minus 120x. So, sum is 2280 - 120x.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 480 + 600 = 1080. Then, 1080 + (1200 - 120x) = 1080 + 1200 = 2280; then 2280 - 120x.\n\nSo, the sum of the ratios is 2280 - 120x.\n\nNow, the ratio for C is 1200 - 120x, and the total is 2280 - 120x.\n\nAccording to the problem, C's share is 150,000, which is (1200 -120x)/ (2280 -120x) * total profit.\n\nWait, but the total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So,\n\n(1200 - 120x) / (2280 - 120x) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nSimplify the right side: 150k / 375k = 2/5.\n\nSo,\n\n(1200 - 120x) / (2280 - 120x) = 2/5.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n5*(1200 - 120x) = 2*(2280 - 120x).\n\nLet me compute each side.\n\nLeft side: 5*1200 = 6000, 5*(-120x) = -600x. So, 6000 -600x.\n\nRight side: 2*2280 = 4560, 2*(-120x) = -240x. So, 4560 -240x.\n\nNow, the equation is:\n\n6000 - 600x = 4560 -240x.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n6000 -600x -4560 +240x = 0.\n\nCompute 6000 -4560 = 1440.\n\n-600x +240x = -360x.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n1440 -360x = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-360x = -1440.\n\nDivide both sides by -360:\n\nx = (-1440)/(-360) = 4.\n\nSo, x is 4 months.\n\nWait, but what does x represent? Earlier, I defined x as the number of months after B joined that C joined. So, C joined 4 months after B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculations because I might have made an error.\n\nWait, let's recast the equation:\n\n5*(1200 -120x) = 2*(2280 -120x).\n\nCompute left: 5 * 1200 = 6000, 5*(-120x)= -600x. So, 6000 -600x.\n\nRight: 2*2280=4560, 2*(-120x)= -240x. So, 4560 -240x.\n\nEquation: 6000 -600x =4560 -240x.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n6000 -4560 = 1440.\n\n-600x +240x = -360x.\n\nSo, 1440 -360x =0 \u2192 360x=1440 \u2192 x=4.\n\nYes, that's correct. So x=4 months.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA)2 months\n\nB)4 months\n\nC)23 months\n\nD)24 months\n\nE)84 months\n\nSo, the answer would be B)4 months.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again about the timeline. A starts at month 0. B joins at month 2. C joins at month (2 + x) = 2+4=6. So, C joins 4 months after B, which is at month 6.\n\nSo, how much time does C invest? From month 6 to month 12: that's 6 months. Wait, but according to earlier calculation, C's time is (10 - x) = 10-4=6 months. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, C's investment period is 6 months. Let me check the profit ratio again.\n\nA: 40,000 *12 = 480,000.\n\nB:60,000 *10=600,000.\n\nC:120,000 *6=720,000.\n\nTotal =480,000 +600,000 +720,000= 1,800,000.\n\nWait, but the total profit is 375,000. Hmm, that's way less than 1,800,000. Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?\n\nWait a second, I think I messed up the units. Because the investments are in thousands. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, no. The problem says, A starts with Rs.40,000. So that's 40,000. Similarly, B has 60,000, and C has 120,000.\n\nWait, so the profit ratio is (40,000 *12) : (60,000 *10) : (120,000 *6).\n\nSo, 40,000 *12 = 480,000.\n\n60,000 *10 = 600,000.\n\n120,000 *6 = 720,000.\n\nTotal ratio sum: 480,000 +600,000 +720,000 = 1,800,000.\n\nSo, the profit is 375,000.\n\nSo, each part is a fraction of 375,000.\n\nWait, but 375,000 is the total, so the ratios should sum up to 375,000. But according to the way I computed, the sum is 1,800,000. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I set up the ratio. Because the actual profit is 375,000, which would mean that the sum of (A's share + B's share + C's share) = 375,000.\n\nWait, but according to the way I set up the ratios, the sum was 480 +600 + (1200 - 120x) in terms of 10,000s. Wait, no, perhaps I should have kept the units straight.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the share each person gets as (capital * time) / total capital-time.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as the profit is divided in proportion to their (capital * time).\n\nSo, the total capital-time is:\n\nA:40,000 *12 = 480,000.\n\nB:60,000 *10 =600,000.\n\nC:120,000 * t, where t is the time C's capital was in.\n\nWait, t is 6 months, as we found x=4, so C's time is 6.\n\nSo, 120,000 *6=720,000.\n\nTotal capital-time is 480,000 +600,000 +720,000= 1,800,000.\n\nSo, C's share would be (720,000 / 1,800,000) * 375,000 = (0.4) * 375,000 = 150,000. Which matches the given data.\n\nSo, calculations are correct. So, x=4 months is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the time, I thought C's time was 10 - x, which with x=4 would be 6 months. So, all seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 4 months after B joined, C joined. So, the correct option is B)4 months.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine how many months after B joined the business did C join, based on the profit-sharing ratio.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **A's Investment**: A starts with Rs. 40,000 and remains in the business for the entire year (12 months).\n2. **B's Investment**: B joins after 2 months with Rs. 60,000 and remains in the business for \\(12 - 2 = 10\\) months.\n3. **C's Investment**: C joins after B with Rs. 120,000 and remains in the business for \\(10 - x\\) months, where \\(x\\) is the number of months after B joined that C joined.\n4. **Total Profit**: The total profit for the year is Rs. 375,000, and C's share is Rs. 150,000.\n\n### Profit-Sharing Ratio:\nThe profit is divided based on the product of the capital invested and the time for which it was invested.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about A, B, and C starting a business together, and I need to figure out how many months after B joined did C join. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the problem again carefully. A starts with Rs.40,000. Then, after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then, C joins after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nWait, the time periods are crucial here because profit sharing in partnerships is based on the time each person's investment was in the business and the amount invested. So, the longer someone's money is in the business, the more they earn.\n\nLet me outline the timeline. A starts first. Let's say the total time is 12 months because it's a year.\n\nA invested Rs.40,000 from the start, so for 12 months.\n\nB joined after 2 months, so B's investment period is 12 - 2 = 10 months.\n\nC joined after B, but I don't know when exactly. Let's denote the number of months after B joined that C joined as x. So, C's investment period would be (10 - x) months? Wait, no, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. Let me think of the entire year as 12 months.\n\nA started at month 0. So, A's investment is for 12 months.\n\nB joined at month 2. So B's investment is for (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n\nC joined after B, so let's say C joined at month (2 + x), where x is the number of months after B joined. So, C's investment period is (12 - (2 + x)) months. Simplify that: 10 - x months.\n\nWait, but wait. If C joined at (2 + x) months, then the time from C's joining to the end of the year is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the profit is divided in the ratio of their investments multiplied by the time they were invested.\n\nSo, the profit sharing ratio would be (A's investment * A's time) : (B's investment * B's time) : (C's investment * C's time).\n\nSo, the ratio is:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12\n\nB: 60,000 * 10\n\nC: 120,000 * (10 - x)\n\nWait, because C's time is 10 - x months? Let me confirm. If the year is 12 months, and C joined x months after B, who joined at month 2, then C joined at month (2 + x). So, the time C's money was in is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So, C's share is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 or 0.4, which is 40% of the total profit.\n\nAlternatively, the profit ratio is (A's part) : (B's part) : (C's part) = 40*12 : 60*10 : 120*(10 -x).\n\nWait, let's compute each part:\n\nA's part: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB's part: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000.\n\nC's part: 120,000 * (10 - x) = 1,200,000 * (10 - x)/10,000? Wait, no. Wait, 120,000 * (10 - x) is 120,000*(10 -x). Let's compute that as 1200000 - 120000x.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to factor out 10,000.\n\nSo, A's part: (40 *12) = 480.\n\nB's part: (60 *10) = 600.\n\nC's part: (120*(10 -x)) = 1200 - 120x.\n\nSo, the ratio is 480 : 600 : (1200 - 120x).\n\nNow, the total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So, the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 = 0.4, which is 40%.\n\nSo, the ratio of C's part to the sum of all parts is 0.4.\n\nSo, C's part is 0.4 of the total.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the ratio. Let me compute the sum of the ratios.\n\nSum = 480 + 600 + (1200 - 120x) = (480 + 600) is 1080, plus 1200 is 2280, minus 120x. So, sum is 2280 - 120x.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 480 + 600 = 1080. Then, 1080 + (1200 - 120x) = 1080 + 1200 = 2280; then 2280 - 120x.\n\nSo, the sum of the ratios is 2280 - 120x.\n\nNow, the ratio for C is 1200 - 120x, and the total is 2280 - 120x.\n\nAccording to the problem, C's share is 150,000, which is (1200 -120x)/ (2280 -120x) * total profit.\n\nWait, but the total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So,\n\n(1200 - 120x) / (2280 - 120x) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nSimplify the right side: 150k / 375k = 2/5.\n\nSo,\n\n(1200 - 120x) / (2280 - 120x) = 2/5.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n5*(1200 - 120x) = 2*(2280 - 120x).\n\nLet me compute each side.\n\nLeft side: 5*1200 = 6000, 5*(-120x) = -600x. So, 6000 -600x.\n\nRight side: 2*2280 = 4560, 2*(-120x) = -240x. So, 4560 -240x.\n\nNow, the equation is:\n\n6000 - 600x = 4560 -240x.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n6000 -600x -4560 +240x = 0.\n\nCompute 6000 -4560 = 1440.\n\n-600x +240x = -360x.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n1440 -360x = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-360x = -1440.\n\nDivide both sides by -360:\n\nx = (-1440)/(-360) = 4.\n\nSo, x is 4 months.\n\nWait, but what does x represent? Earlier, I defined x as the number of months after B joined that C joined. So, C joined 4 months after B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculations because I might have made an error.\n\nWait, let's recast the equation:\n\n5*(1200 -120x) = 2*(2280 -120x).\n\nCompute left: 5 * 1200 = 6000, 5*(-120x)= -600x. So, 6000 -600x.\n\nRight: 2*2280=4560, 2*(-120x)= -240x. So, 4560 -240x.\n\nEquation: 6000 -600x =4560 -240x.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n6000 -4560 = 1440.\n\n-600x +240x = -360x.\n\nSo, 1440 -360x =0 \u2192 360x=1440 \u2192 x=4.\n\nYes, that's correct. So x=4 months.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA)2 months\n\nB)4 months\n\nC)23 months\n\nD)24 months\n\nE)84 months\n\nSo, the answer would be B)4 months.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again about the timeline. A starts at month 0. B joins at month 2. C joins at month (2 + x) = 2+4=6. So, C joins 4 months after B, which is at month 6.\n\nSo, how much time does C invest? From month 6 to month 12: that's 6 months. Wait, but according to earlier calculation, C's time is (10 - x) = 10-4=6 months. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, C's investment period is 6 months. Let me check the profit ratio again.\n\nA: 40,000 *12 = 480,000.\n\nB:60,000 *10=600,000.\n\nC:120,000 *6=720,000.\n\nTotal =480,000 +600,000 +720,000= 1,800,000.\n\nWait, but the total profit is 375,000. Hmm, that's way less than 1,800,000. Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?\n\nWait a second, I think I messed up the units. Because the investments are in thousands. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, no. The problem says, A starts with Rs.40,000. So that's 40,000. Similarly, B has 60,000, and C has 120,000.\n\nWait, so the profit ratio is (40,000 *12) : (60,000 *10) : (120,000 *6).\n\nSo, 40,000 *12 = 480,000.\n\n60,000 *10 = 600,000.\n\n120,000 *6 = 720,000.\n\nTotal ratio sum: 480,000 +600,000 +720,000 = 1,800,000.\n\nSo, the profit is 375,000.\n\nSo, each part is a fraction of 375,000.\n\nWait, but 375,000 is the total, so the ratios should sum up to 375,000. But according to the way I computed, the sum is 1,800,000. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I set up the ratio. Because the actual profit is 375,000, which would mean that the sum of (A's share + B's share + C's share) = 375,000.\n\nWait, but according to the way I set up the ratios, the sum was 480 +600 + (1200 - 120x) in terms of 10,000s. Wait, no, perhaps I should have kept the units straight.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the share each person gets as (capital * time) / total capital-time.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as the profit is divided in proportion to their (capital * time).\n\nSo, the total capital-time is:\n\nA:40,000 *12 = 480,000.\n\nB:60,000 *10 =600,000.\n\nC:120,000 * t, where t is the time C's capital was in.\n\nWait, t is 6 months, as we found x=4, so C's time is 6.\n\nSo, 120,000 *6=720,000.\n\nTotal capital-time is 480,000 +600,000 +720,000= 1,800,000.\n\nSo, C's share would be (720,000 / 1,800,000) * 375,000 = (0.4) * 375,000 = 150,000. Which matches the given data.\n\nSo, calculations are correct. So, x=4 months is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the time, I thought C's time was 10 - x, which with x=4 would be 6 months. So, all seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 4 months after B joined, C joined. So, the correct option is B)4 months.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine how many months after B joined the business did C join, based on the profit-sharing ratio.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **A's Investment**: A starts with Rs. 40,000 and remains in the business for the entire year (12 months).\n2. **B's Investment**: B joins after 2 months with Rs. 60,000 and remains in the business for \\(12 - 2 = 10\\) months.\n3. **C's Investment**: C joins after B with Rs. 120,000 and remains in the business for \\(10 - x\\) months, where \\(x\\) is the number of months after B joined that C joined.\n4. **Total Profit**: The total profit for the year is Rs. 375,000, and C's share is Rs. 150,000.\n\n### Profit-Sharing Ratio:\nThe profit is divided based on the product of the capital invested and the time for which it was invested. The ratio is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = (\\text{A's capital} \\times \\text{A's time}) : (\\text{B's capital} \\times \\text{B's time}) : (\\text{C's capital} \\times \\text{C's time})\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n\\text{A's part} = 40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{B's part} = 60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{C's part} = 120,000 \\times (10 - x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000x\n\\]\n\n### Total Profit and C's Share:\nThe total profit is Rs. 375,000, and C's share is Rs. 150,000. The fraction of the profit that C receives is:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{C's share}}{\\text{Total profit}} = \\frac{150,000}{375,000} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\nThis means that C's profit ratio is \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) of the total profit.\n\n### Setting Up the Equation:\nThe total profit ratio is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total ratio} = \\text{A's part} + \\text{B's part} + \\text{C's part} = 480,000 + 600,000 + (1,200,000 - 120,000x) = 2,280,000 - 120,000x\n\\]\nThe fraction of the total ratio corresponding to C is:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{C's part}}{\\text{Total ratio}} = \\frac{1,200,000 - 120,000x}{2,280,000 - 120,000x}\n\\]\nThis fraction equals \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\), so:\n\\[\n\\frac{1,200,000 - 120,000x}{2,280,000 - 120,000x} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\n### Solving for \\(x\\):\nCross-multiplying:\n\\[\n5(1,200,000 - 120,000x) = 2(2,280,000 - 120,000x)\n\\]\nExpanding both sides:\n\\[\n6,000,000 - 600,000x = 4,560,000 - 240,000x\n\\]\nBringing all terms to one side:\n\\[\n6,000,000 - 4,560,000 = 600,000x - 240,000x\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n1,440,000 = 360,000x\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1,440,000}{360,000} = 4\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nC joined the business 4 months after B joined. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this business problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nThe problem says that A starts a business with Rs.40,000. Then, after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then, some time later, C joins with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join. The options are A to E, with some numbers.\n\nHmm, so I remember that when partners invest different amounts for different periods, their profit share is based on their capital multiplied by the time they were invested. So the ratio of their shares is (capital \u00d7 time) for each.\n\nLet me think about the timeline. The entire period is 12 months. \n\nA started alone for the first 2 months, then B joined. So A's investment is 40,000 for 12 months, right? Wait no, because B joined after 2 months, so A is there for all 12 months. Wait no, wait. No, wait. No, wait. Let me correct that. A started with 40k. Then after 2 months, B joins. So A's investment was for 12 months, but B's is for 10 months, because the year ends after 12 months. Wait no, if B joined after 2 months, then he stayed for 10 months? Because 2 months before, and 10 after. Oh, wait, the entire duration is 12 months. So if B joined after 2 months, he was there for 10 months. So B's time is 10 months.\n\nThen C joins after some time after B. So let's say C joined x months after B. So how much time does C have? Well, the total time from when C joined is 12 minus (2 + x) months. Because the total time is 12 months. Let me see, if B joined after 2 months, and C joined after x months from B's joining, then C was there for 12 - (2 + x) months. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, the business runs for a year, so 12 months. Let's structure the timeline:\n\n- A starts at month 0 with 40k.\n\n- B joins at month 2 with 60k.\n\n- C joins at month (2 + x), where x is the number of months after B joined that C joined.\n\nSo the time each person contributed their capital:\n\n- A: 12 months.\n\n- B: (12 - 2) = 10 months minus the time after B that C joined? Wait no. Wait, B joined at month 2. So if C joined x months after B, then C joined at month (2 + x). So the time each person's capital was in the business:\n\nA: from month 0 to 12: 12 months.\n\nB: from month 2 to 12: 10 months.\n\nC: from month (2 + x) to 12: (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months. Because if x is the time after B, then C is in for 10 - x months.\n\nSo their investments are:\n\nA: 40,000 \u00d7 12.\n\nB: 60,000 \u00d7 (10 - x). Wait no, wait. Wait, no, because if C joined after x months of B joining, then B's time is 12 - 2 = 10 months, minus the time after C joined. No, that's not correct. Let me think again. B joined at month 2, and stayed until the end (month 12). So B's time is 12 - 2 = 10 months. Similarly, C joined at month (2 + x) and stayed until month 12, so C's time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. So yes, C's time is (10 - x) months.\n\nSo the profit is divided in the ratio of their (capital \u00d7 time). So the total profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000. So C's share is 150k, which is (150,000 / 375,000) = 40% of the total profit.\n\nSo the ratio of C's capital \u00d7 time to the total of all three's (capital \u00d7 time) should be 40%.\n\nWait, let's write the ratios.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA's contribution: 40,000 \u00d7 12 = 480,000.\n\nB's contribution: 60,000 \u00d7 10 = 600,000. Wait, but wait, B's time is 10 months, right? Because he joined at 2 months and stayed till 12, so 10 months.\n\nWait, no, earlier I thought C's time was (10 - x) months, but that's only if B's time is 10. So the calculation for B is 60,000 \u00d7 10 = 600,000.\n\nWait, but wait, if C joined x months after B, then B is in the business for 10 months, regardless of when C joins. Because B is there from month 2 to month 12, which is 10 months. So C's time is (10 - x) months? No, that can't be. Because if C joins x months after B, then the time C is in is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. So if x is 5, C is in for 5 months.\n\nSo now, the contributions:\n\nA: 40,000 \u00d7 12 = 480,000.\n\nB: 60,000 \u00d7 10 = 600,000.\n\nC: 120,000 \u00d7 (10 - x) = 120,000 \u00d7 (10 - x).\n\nWait, no, no, wait, C's time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.\n\nSo the total profit is divided according to the sum of all their contributions.\n\nSo the ratio of C's share to total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 = 0.4, which is 40%. \n\nWait, but that's the ratio of C's share to the total. So the sum of all their contributions is the denominator.\n\nWait, no, profit is divided in the ratio of their individual contributions. So the total profit is divided based on the sum of their contributions.\n\nSo the total contribution is A + B + C = 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 - x) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000*(10 - x)/1000? Wait, no, let me compute each:\n\nWait, 120,000 \u00d7 (10 - x) is C's contribution.\n\nSo total = 480,000 (A) + 600,000 (B) + 120,000*(10 - x) (C).\n\nSo total = 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 -x) \n\n= 1,080,000 + (120,000 \u00d7 10) - (120,000 \u00d7 x)\n\n= 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 x\n\n= 2,280,000 - 120,000 x.\n\nWait, but the profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4, or 40%.\n\nSo the ratio of C's contribution to the total contribution is 40%. So:\n\nC's contribution / total contributions = 0.4\n\nSo:\n\n[120,000*(10 - x)] / [2,280,000 - 120,000 x] = 0.4\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n(120000*(10 - x)) / (2280000 - 120000 x) = 0.4\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n120000*(10 - x) = 0.4*(2280000 - 120000 x)\n\nLet me compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: 120000*(10 -x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 x.\n\nRight side: 0.4 * (2,280,000 - 120,000 x) = 0.4 *2,280,000 - 0.4 *120,000 x.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000.\n\n0.4 * 120,000 = 48,000.\n\nSo right side is 912,000 - 48,000 x.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n1,200,000 - 120,000 x = 912,000 - 48,000 x.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n1,200,000 - 120,000 x -912,000 +48,000 x = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(1,200,000 -912,000) + (-120,000 x +48,000 x) =0.\n\n288,000 -72,000 x = 0.\n\nSo 288,000 =72,000 x.\n\nx=288,000 /72,000 =4.\n\nSo x is 4. So C joined 4 months after B joined.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4 months.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check. Because when x is 4, C joined 4 months after B.\n\nSo let's recalculate the contributions.\n\nA: 40,000 \u00d712 =480,000.\n\nB:60,000 \u00d710=600,000.\n\nC:120,000 \u00d7 (10-4)=120,000 \u00d76=720,000.\n\nTotal contributions: 480,000 +600,000 +720,000 = 1,800,000.\n\nC's share is 720,000 / 1,800,000 = 0.4, which is 40%. So C's share is 40% of 375,000 is 150,000, which matches the problem statement.\n\nSo x is 4 months. So the correct answer is option B.\n",

Wait no, if B joined after 2 months, then he stayed for 10 months? Because 2 months before, and 10 after. Oh, wait, the entire duration is 12 months. So if B joined after 2 months, he was there for 10 months. So B's time is 10 months.\n\nThen C joins after some time after B. So let's say C joined x months after B. So how much time does C have? Well, the total time from when C joined is 12 minus (2 + x) months. Because the total time is 12 months. Let me see, if B joined after 2 months, and C joined after x months from B's joining, then C was there for 12 - (2 + x) months. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, the business runs for a year, so 12 months. Let's structure the timeline:\n\n- A starts at month 0 with 40k.\n\n- B joins at month 2 with 60k.\n\n- C joins at month (2 + x), where x is the number of months after B joined that C joined.\n\nSo the time each person contributed their capital:\n\n- A: 12 months.\n\n- B: (12 - 2) = 10 months minus the time after B that C joined?

Wait, no, let me compute each:\n\nWait, 120,000 \u00d7 (10 - x) is C's contribution.\n\nSo total = 480,000 (A) + 600,000 (B) + 120,000*(10 - x) (C).\n\nSo total = 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 -x) \n\n= 1,080,000 + (120,000 \u00d7 10) - (120,000 \u00d7 x)\n\n= 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 x\n\n= 2,280,000 - 120,000 x.\n\nWait, but the profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4, or 40%.\n\nSo the ratio of C's contribution to the total contribution is 40%. So:\n\nC's contribution / total contributions = 0.4\n\nSo:\n\n[120,000*(10 - x)] / [2,280,000 - 120,000 x] = 0.4\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n(120000*(10 - x)) / (2280000 - 120000 x) = 0.4\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n120000*(10 - x) = 0.4*(2280000 - 120000 x)\n\nLet me compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: 120000*(10 -x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 x.\n\nRight side: 0.4 * (2,280,000 - 120,000 x) = 0.4 *2,280,000 - 0.4 *120,000 x.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000.\n\n0.4 * 120,000 = 48,000.\n\nSo right side is 912,000 - 48,000 x.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n1,200,000 - 120,000 x = 912,000 - 48,000 x.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n1,200,000 - 120,000 x -912,000 +48,000 x = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(1,200,000 -912,000) + (-120,000 x +48,000 x) =0.\n\n288,000 -72,000 x = 0.\n\nSo 288,000 =72,000 x.\n\nx=288,000 /72,000 =4.\n\nSo x is 4. So C joined 4 months after B joined.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4 months.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check. Because when x is 4, C joined 4 months after B.\n\nSo let's recalculate the contributions.\n\nA: 40,000 \u00d712 =480,000.\n\nB:60,000 \u00d710=600,000.\n\nC:120,000 \u00d7 (10-4)=120,000 \u00d76=720,000.\n\nTotal contributions: 480,000 +600,000 +720,000 = 1,800,000.\n\nC's share is 720,000 / 1,800,000 = 0.4, which is 40%. So C's share is 40% of 375,000 is 150,000, which matches the problem statement.\n\nSo x is 4 months. So the correct answer is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the timeline and contributions of each partner:\n\n1. **Timeline and Contributions**:\n   - A starts the business with Rs.40,000 and remains for the entire year (12 months).\n   - B joins after 2 months with Rs.60,000 and remains for 10 months (from month 2 to month 12).\n   - C joins after \\(x\\) months from B's joining (i.e., at month \\(2 + x\\)) and remains for \\(10 - x\\) months (from month \\(2 + x\\) to month 12).\n\n2. **Profit Sharing**:\n   - Profit is divided based on the ratio of each partner's contribution, which is calculated as \\((\\text{Capital} \\times \\text{Time})\\).\n   - A's contribution: \\(40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000\\).\n   - B's contribution: \\(60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000\\).\n   - C's contribution: \\(120,000 \\times (10 - x)\\).\n\n3. **Total Contributions**:\n   - Total contribution = \\(480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \\times (10 - x)\\).\n   - Simplifying: \\(1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000x = 2,280,000 - 120,000x\\).\n\n4. **C's Share**:\n   - C's share of the profit is Rs.150,000 out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, which corresponds to \\(40\\%\\) of the total profit.\n   - Therefore, the ratio of C's contribution to the total contributions is \\(0.4\\).\n\n5. **Equation for \\(x\\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - x)}{2,280,000 - 120,000x} = 0.4\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   1,200,000 - 120,000x = 912,000 - 48,000x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   288,000 = 72,000x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 4\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - C joined 4 months after B joined. This matches option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",
