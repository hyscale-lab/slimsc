      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a cereal mixture. Let me read it again to make sure I get the details right. The mixture has rice, wheat, and corn in a ratio of 2:3:5. A bag of this mixture contains 3 pounds of rice, and the question is asking how much corn it contains. The options are A)6.5, B)7.5, C)7, D)6, E)None of the above.\n\nHmm, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but I think I get the basics. Ratios compare quantities, so here, the parts are 2 for rice, 3 for wheat, and 5 for corn. So, for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts wheat and 5 parts corn.\n\nWait, the bag has 3 pounds of rice. So, I need to find out what each part is equal to in pounds, then multiply by the number of parts for corn.\n\nLet me think about this. If the ratio is 2:3:5, the total parts are 2 + 3 + 5. Let me add that up. 2 plus 3 is 5, plus another 5 makes 10. So, the total parts are 10.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 2 (rice) + 3 (wheat) +5 (corn) is 10 parts in total. So, each part is a certain number of pounds.\n\nBut wait, the 3 pounds is rice, which is 2 parts. So, 2 parts equal 3 pounds. That means each part is 3 pounds divided by 2. Let me calculate that: 3 / 2 = 1.5 pounds per part.\n\nOh, right! So each part is 1.5 pounds. Now, how much is corn? Corn is 5 parts. So, 5 parts multiplied by 1.5 pounds per part.\n\nLet me compute that: 5 * 1.5. 5 times 1 is 5, and 5 times 0.5 is 2.5. So, 5 + 2.5 = 7.5 pounds of corn.\n\nWait, but let me check my reasoning again. The ratio is 2:3:5, meaning 2 parts rice, 3 wheat, 5 corn. If rice is 3 pounds and that's 2 parts, each part is 1.5. So corn is 5 *1.5 =7.5. That's option B.\n\nWait a minute, but wait another thing. Could I have made a mistake in the initial ratio? Let me think. The ratio is rice to wheat to corn as 2:3:5. So the first number is rice, second wheat, third corn.\n\nSo yeah, 2 parts rice = 3 pounds. So each part is 1.5. Corn is 5 parts, so 7.5. That would be option B.\n\nBut looking at the options, B is 7.5. So that's the answer. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratios. Suppose I thought the ratio was in a different order, but no, the question says the ratio is rice, wheat, corn in that order. So 2:3:5 is rice to wheat to corn.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire mixture. The total mixture would be 10 parts. If each part is 1.5 pounds, the total would be 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds. But the problem only says the bag contains 3 pounds of rice. So maybe the total mixture is 15 pounds, but the question is only about the corn in that mixture.\n\nSo the corn would be 5 parts, which is 7.5 pounds. So option B is correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, I see option B is 7.5. So that's the correct answer. So I think the correct choice is B.\n",

So for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts wheat and 5 parts corn. But I think I need to find the total parts first. Let me add them up: 2 + 3 +5 equals 10 parts total. Oh wait, no, wait.
