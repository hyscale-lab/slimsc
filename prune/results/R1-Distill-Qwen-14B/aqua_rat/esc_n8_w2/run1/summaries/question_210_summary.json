      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Shweta riding her bike, and I need to figure out how long it takes her to cover 100 km. Let's see... Hmm, she rides at 10 km per hour, but she stops every 15 km for 10 minutes. Oh right, I remember these types of problems where you have to account for both the time spent moving and the rest periods. \n\nAlright, let's break it down. First, I'll think about how long she takes to ride each 15 km segment. Since her speed is 10 km/h, the time per 15 km would be distance divided by speed. So 15 km divided by 10 km/h is 1.5 hours. Wait, that's the same as 90 minutes. But she rests for 10 minutes after each 15 km. So each 15 km chunk takes her 1.5 hours of riding plus 10 minutes of rest. \n\nWait, but wait a minute\u2014does she rest after the last segment? Like, if she completes exactly 100 km, maybe she doesn't need to rest at the end. Because the problem says she stops after every 15 km. So I need to figure out how many rest stops she takes.\n\nLet me calculate how many 15 km segments are in 100 km. So 100 divided by 15 is... let's see, 15 *6=90, 15*7=105. So that's 6 full segments of 15 km each, which makes 90 km. Then she has 10 km left. So she completes 6 segments, rests 6 times, and then does a 10 km ride without resting afterwards.\n\nSo for each of the 6 segments, she rides 15 km, which takes 1.5 hours, and rests for 10 minutes. So 6 segments mean 6 times (1.5h + 0.1667h) wait, wait. 10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour, which is approximately 0.1667 hours. So for each segment, it's 1.5 + 0.1667 = 1.6667 hours. Multiply that by 6, that's 6 * 1.6667 = 10 hours. Then, she has the last 10 km to do. How long does that take?\n\nAt 10 km/h, the time is 10 km /10 km/h = 1 hour. So adding that to the previous 10 hours, that's 11 hours total. \n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let's recalculate each part more carefully. \n\nEach 15 km takes 15/10 = 1.5 hours (which is 90 minutes). Plus a 10-minute rest, so each segment is 100 minutes. Wait, 90 minutes riding plus 10 minutes rest is 100 minutes per 15 km. So how many of these segments are there before the last part?\n\nAs before, 6 segments make 90 km, and the 7th is 10 km. So 6 segments. So 6 times 100 minutes is 600 minutes. Then the last 10 km is 60 minutes. So total time is 600 + 60 = 660 minutes. Convert that to hours: 660 /60 = 11 hours. So that's 11 hours. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 11 hours. So the answer should be C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine how long Shweta takes to cover 100 km, we account for both her riding time and rest periods.

The question is asking how long it'll take her to cover 100 km, but with some stops in between.\n\nWait, right, she stops for 10 minutes every time she covers 15 km. So every 15 km, she takes a 10-minute break. Hmm, I need to figure out how much time she spends riding and how much time she spends resting. Then add them together to get the total time.\n\nFirst, let me think about the riding part. Her speed is 10 km/h, so to find out how much time she spends riding without considering the stops, I can divide the total distance by her speed. But wait, that's only if she didn't stop at all. But since she's stopping, I need to break it down.\n\nShe stops after every 15 km. So how many such segments are there in 100 km? Let me calculate. 100 divided by 15. Hmm, 15 times 6 is 90, so that's 6 segments, each 15 km, which is 90 km. Then the last 10 km she doesn't stop after because she's reached 100. So the number of rest stops would be 6, right? Because after each 15 km, she stops, but the last one (the 6th) would be at 90 km, and then she rides the remaining 10 km without stopping.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: for 100 km, the segments would be 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, and then 10. So after each 15 km, she stops, except after the last 10 km. So yes, 6 stops.\n\nNow, each stop is 10 minutes. So the total rest time is 6 stops multiplied by 10 minutes each. 6*10=60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nNext, the riding time. For each 15 km segment, how long does she take? Since her speed is 10 km/h, time is distance over speed. So 15 km / 10 km/h = 1.5 hours per segment. She has 6 segments of 15 km each. So 6 * 1.5 hours = 9 hours.\n\nThen the last 10 km. Again, time is distance/speed. 10 km /10 km/h = 1 hour.\n\nSo total riding time is 9 hours (for the 15 km parts) plus 1 hour (for the last 10 km) = 10 hours.\n\nPlus the rest time of 1 hour. So total time is 10 + 1 = 11 hours.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. So the first 90 km is covered in 6 segments, each taking 1.5 hours. So 6 *1.5=9 hours. Then 10 km takes 1 hour. So riding time is 10 hours, and 6 stops of 10 minutes each: 6 *10=60 minutes=1 hour. So total time is 10 +1=11 hours.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 11 hours. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me think if I missed any stops. For example, does she stop after the last 15 km? Like, after 15 km, 30 km, etc. Wait, the first 15 km: she rides 15 km, then stops. Second 15 km: rides another 15, stops. So after 90 km, she's done 6 stops. Then she rides the remaining 10 km, no stop. So 6 stops, yes.\n\nAnother way to think: how many times does she stop? She stops after every 15 km, except the last part. So for 100 km, she completes 6 full 15 km segments (6 *15=90 km). So she stops 6 times. So yeah, 6 stops.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct. So the answer is 11 hours, which is option C.\n",
