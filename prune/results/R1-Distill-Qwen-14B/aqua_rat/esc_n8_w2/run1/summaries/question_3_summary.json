      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says: \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" Hmm, wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me read it again.\n\nOh, right, the question is asking which value is a multiple of X, but X has to be divisible by both 9 and 12. So, I think I need to find X first, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12. Because if X is a multiple of both, then the LCM would be the smallest such number, and any multiple of X would be a multiple of both 9 and 12 as well.\n\nSo, how do I find the LCM of 9 and 12? I remember that the LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. One way to find the LCM is by using the prime factors of each number.\n\nLet's break down 9 and 12 into their prime factors. \n\n9 is 3 squared, so 3 \u00d7 3, which is 3\u00b2.\n12 is 2 squared times 3, so 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3.\n\nTo find the LCM, I take the highest power of each prime number present in the factorizations. So for 2, the highest power is 2\u00b2 from 12. For 3, it's 3\u00b2 from 9. So multiplying those together gives the LCM.\n\nCalculating that: 2\u00b2 is 4, and 3\u00b2 is 9. 4 times 9 is 36. So the LCM of 9 and 12 is 36. That means X must be 36 or a multiple of 36. But wait, the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X. So each option is a number, and we have to see if that number is a multiple of X, which is 36.\n\nWait, no, wait. I think I got that wrong. Let me read the question again. It says, \"which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12.\" Oh, wait, maybe I misunderstood. So the value in the options is a multiple of X, which must be divisible by 9 and 12. So X must be a common divisor of the option's value, and X must be divisible by both 9 and 12.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let's parse it again. The problem says: \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think. The value in the options is a multiple of X. Also, X must be divisible by 9 and 12. So, X is a number that is a multiple of both 9 and 12. So X must be the LCM of 9 and 12, which is 36, or a multiple of 36. So X could be 36, 72, 108, etc.\n\nBut the options are the values, and each value is a multiple of X. So, the value must be a multiple of 36, because X is 36 or a multiple of it. Wait, but if X is 36, then the value must be 36 times some integer. If X is 72, then the value must be a multiple of 72, which is a higher number. But looking at the options, the numbers are 36, 15, 17, 5, 7. So the only option that is a multiple of 36 is 36 itself, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching it wrong. Let's think differently. The problem says the value is a multiple of X, and X is divisible by 9 and 12. So X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. But the value (the option) must be a multiple of X, which is itself a multiple of 36.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. X is a number that's divisible by both 9 and 12, so X must be a multiple of their LCM, which is 36. So X can be 36, 72, 108, etc. Now, the question is which of the given options is a multiple of X. That would mean that the option's value must be divisible by X, which is 36 or higher. So the option's value must be a multiple of 36.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)36 \u2192 36 is a multiple of 36 (since 36\u00d71=36)\nB)15 \u2192 15 \u00f736 is 0.416..., which is not an integer. So 15 is not a multiple of 36.\nC)17 \u2192 Same, 17 \u00f736 is less than 1 and not integer.\nD)5 \u2192 Not a multiple of 36.\nE)7 \u2192 Same.\n\nSo the only option that is a multiple of X (which is 36) is option A)36.\n\nWait, but another way: perhaps the question is phrased as \"the value is a multiple of X, and X is divisible by 9 and 12.\" So the value must be a multiple of X, which is a multiple of 36. So the value must be a multiple of 36. Therefore, among the options, only 36 is a multiple of 36. So the answer is A.\n",

Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question is: Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12? The options are A)36, B)15, C)17, D)5, E)7.\n\nWait, that wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it. So, X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. And the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X. Or wait, maybe it's phrased the other way around. Oh, wait, no, the wording is: which of the following is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by 9 and 12. So X is a common multiple of 9 and 12, and we need to find which option is a multiple of X.\n\nHmm, maybe I should think in terms of least common multiples. Because if X is divisible by both 9 and 12, then X must be a common multiple of these two numbers. The smallest such X would be the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, let's find the LCM of 9 and 12. To do that, I can break them down into their prime factors. 9 is 3^2, and 12 is 2^2 * 3^1. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So that would be 2^2 * 3^2 = 4 * 9 = 36. So the LCM of 9 and 12 is 36. That means X could be 36, or any multiple of 36, like 72, 108, etc.\n\nWait, but the problem says X is divisible by 9 and 12, so X must be a multiple of 36. So X can be 36, 72, etc. Now, the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X. Wait, no, the options are numbers, and the question is which of them is a multiple of X. Or wait, the options are numbers, and X is a number that is a multiple of 9 and 12. So the options are possible X values, and we need to pick which one is a multiple of X, but I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait no, let me read the question again. Oh, wait, the question says: Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12. Hmm, maybe I'm getting it backwards. So, X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12, so X is a multiple of both, meaning X is a common multiple. So X could be 36, 72, etc. Now, the question is, which of the options is a multiple of X. So among the options A to E, which number is a multiple of X.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the options are 36, 15, 17, 5, 7. So, if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of 36. So option A is 36, which would be a multiple of X=36. So 36 is a multiple of itself. So A would be a correct answer. But wait, are there any other possibilities?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased as: which of the following is a multiple of X, where X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. So, X is a common multiple, so the options are possible multiples of X. So, the options are numbers, and we need to find which one is a multiple of X.\n\nWait, but that would require knowing what X is. Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as: which of the options is a multiple of X, and X is divisible by 9 and 12. So, X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12, and the options are possible multiples of X.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to rephrase the question. The question is: which of the given numbers is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by both 9 and 12. So X is a common multiple of 9 and 12, and the options are possible values of X or perhaps numbers that are multiples of X.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is: which of the given options is a multiple of X, and X is a number that is itself divisible by 9 and 12. So X is a common multiple of 9 and 12, and the options are numbers, and we need to find which is a multiple of X.\n\nWait, but that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as: which of the options is a multiple of X, and X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12. So, X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12, which we've determined is 36, 72, etc. Now, the options are 36,15,17,5,7. So, the options are possible multiples of X.\n\nBut wait, if X is 36, then which of these options is a multiple of 36? Let's see: 36 is a multiple of 36 (36 *1), 15 is not (15 <36 and 36 doesn't divide into 15), 17 is smaller than 36, 5 and 7 as well. So only option A (36) is a multiple of X if X is 36.\n\nBut wait, if X is a larger multiple, say 72, then none of the options would be a multiple of X because all options are less than 72. So in that case, none of the options would be a multiple of X. But the question says \"if it is divisible by 9 and 12,\" which implies that X must be the minimal such number, perhaps? Because otherwise, the options might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking: which of the options is a multiple of X, where X is a number that is a multiple of both 9 and 12. So X could be 36, 72, etc. So the options are 36,15,17,5,7. So which of these is a multiple of X, meaning which of these numbers is a multiple of X. So, for example, if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (36*1). But if X is 72, then none of the options are multiples of 72. So the only possible X from the options is 36, making option A the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as: which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. So X is a common multiple of 9 and 12, which is 36, 72, etc. So the options are possible multiples of X.\n\nWait, but if the options are the possible X's, then perhaps the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X, where X is a number that is itself a multiple of both 9 and 12. So X could be 36, 72, etc. So which of the options is a multiple of X.\n\nWait, but the options are numbers like 36, 15, 17, etc. So if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X. So option A is a multiple of X. If X were 72, then none of the options are multiples of 72. So the only option that works is 36.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure if I'm interpreting the question correctly. Let me try another approach. The problem says \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the wording is: which value is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by 9 and 12. So X is a common multiple of 9 and 12, which is 36, 72, etc. So the options are possible multiples of X.\n\nBut the options are 36,15,17,5,7. So which of these is a multiple of X. So, for example, if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple (36*1), so A is correct. But if X is 72, then none of the options are multiples of 72. So the only possible X that makes any of the options a multiple is X=36, and the option is 36.\n\nSo the correct answer would be A)36.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X, where X is a number that is itself a multiple of both 9 and 12. So, X is a common multiple, so X could be 36, 72, etc. So the options are numbers, and we have to pick which is a multiple of X.\n\nBut without knowing X, perhaps the question is to find the least such X, which is 36, and then see which option is a multiple of 36. So the only option that is a multiple of 36 is 36 itself. So the answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think: X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12. So X must be a common multiple. The smallest such X is 36. So the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X. So if X is 36, the options are 36,15,17,5,7. So 36 is a multiple of 36, so A is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as: which of the options is a multiple of X, and X is a number that is a multiple of both 9 and 12. So X is 36, 72, etc. The options are 36,15,17,5,7. So 36 is a multiple of X only if X is 36. So the answer is A.\n\nAnother way to think: if X is a multiple of both 9 and 12, then X must be a multiple of their LCM, which is 36. So X is 36, 72, etc. The options are 36,15,17,5,7. So which of these is a multiple of X. Let's check each option.\n\nIf the option is 36, then X could be 36, so 36 is a multiple of X. If X were 72, then 36 is not a multiple of 72. So 36 is a multiple of X only if X is 36. So in that case, option A is correct.\n\nBut wait, the options are the possible values of X, or the possible multiples of X? No, the options are the values we need to check if they are multiples of X. So the question is: which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by 9 and 12. So the options are possible multiples of X.\n\nWait, but X could be any common multiple of 9 and 12, like 36, 72, 108, etc. So the options are 36,15,17,5,7. So, which of these is a multiple of X. Let's take each option:\n\nA)36: Is 36 a multiple of X? That would mean X divides into 36. But X is a multiple of 36, as X is a common multiple of 9 and 12. So if X is 36, then yes, 36 is a multiple of X. If X is 72, then 36 is not a multiple of 72. So in that case, it depends on what X is. But the question says \"if it is divisible by 9 and 12,\" which implies X is a common multiple, but perhaps the minimal one. So the minimal X is 36, so 36 is a multiple of X.\n\nSo the correct answer would be A)36.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If X is a number that's divisible by 9 and 12, then X could be 36, 72, 108, etc. So the options are 36,15,17,5,7. The question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X. So, for example, if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple. If X is 72, then none of the options are multiples of 72 because all options are smaller than 72. So the only way for any of the options to be a multiple of X is if X is 36.\n\nSo the answer is A)36.\n",

Oh, wait, no, the wording is: which of the following is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by 9 and 12. So X is a common multiple of 9 and 12, and we need to find which option is a multiple of X.\n\nHmm, maybe I should think in terms of least common multiples. Because if X is divisible by both 9 and 12, then X must be a common multiple of these two numbers. The smallest such X would be the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, let's find the LCM of 9 and 12. To do that, I can break them down into their prime factors. 9 is 3^2, and 12 is 2^2 * 3^1. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So that would be 2^2 * 3^2 = 4 * 9 = 36. So the LCM of 9 and 12 is 36. That means X could be 36, or any multiple of 36, like 72, 108, etc.\n\nWait, but the problem says X is divisible by 9 and 12, so X must be a multiple of 36. So X can be 36, 72, etc. Now, the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X. Wait, no, the options are numbers, and the question is which of them is a multiple of X. Or wait, the options are numbers, and X is a number that is a multiple of 9 and 12. So the options are possible X values, and we need to pick which one is a multiple of X, but I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait no, let me read the question again. Oh, wait, the question says: Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12. Hmm, maybe I'm getting it backwards. So, X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12, so X is a multiple of both, meaning X is a common multiple. So X could be 36, 72, etc. Now, the question is, which of the options is a multiple of X. So among the options A to E, which number is a multiple of X.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the options are 36, 15, 17, 5, 7. So, if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of 36. So option A is 36, which would be a multiple of X=36. So 36 is a multiple of itself. So A would be a correct answer. But wait, are there any other possibilities?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased as: which of the following is a multiple of X, where X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. So, X is a common multiple, so the options are possible multiples of X. So, the options are numbers, and we need to find which one is a multiple of X.\n\nWait, but that would require knowing what X is. Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as: which of the options is a multiple of X, and X is divisible by 9 and 12. So, X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12, and the options are possible multiples of X.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to rephrase the question. The question is: which of the given numbers is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by both 9 and 12. So X is a common multiple of 9 and 12, and the options are possible values of X or perhaps numbers that are multiples of X.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is: which of the given options is a multiple of X, and X is a number that is itself divisible by 9 and 12. So X is a common multiple of 9 and 12, and the options are numbers, and we need to find which is a multiple of X.\n\nWait, but that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as: which of the options is a multiple of X, and X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12. So, X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12, which we've determined is 36, 72, etc. Now, the options are 36,15,17,5,7. So, the options are possible multiples of X.\n\nBut wait, if X is 36, then which of these options is a multiple of 36? Let's see: 36 is a multiple of 36 (36 *1), 15 is not (15 <36 and 36 doesn't divide into 15), 17 is smaller than 36, 5 and 7 as well. So only option A (36) is a multiple of X if X is 36.\n\nBut wait, if X is a larger multiple, say 72, then none of the options would be a multiple of X because all options are less than 72. So in that case, none of the options would be a multiple of X. But the question says \"if it is divisible by 9 and 12,\" which implies that X must be the minimal such number, perhaps? Because otherwise, the options might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking: which of the options is a multiple of X, where X is a number that is a multiple of both 9 and 12. So X could be 36, 72, etc. So the options are 36,15,17,5,7. So which of these is a multiple of X, meaning which of these numbers is a multiple of X. So, for example, if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (36*1). But if X is 72, then none of the options are multiples of 72. So the only possible X from the options is 36, making option A the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as: which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. So X is a common multiple of 9 and 12, which is 36, 72, etc. So the options are possible multiples of X.\n\nWait, but if the options are the possible X's, then perhaps the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X, where X is a number that is itself a multiple of both 9 and 12. So X could be 36, 72, etc. So which of the options is a multiple of X.\n\nWait, but the options are numbers like 36, 15, 17, etc. So if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X. So option A is a multiple of X. If X were 72, then none of the options are multiples of 72. So the only option that works is 36.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure if I'm interpreting the question correctly. Let me try another approach. The problem says \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the wording is: which value is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by 9 and 12. So X is a common multiple of 9 and 12, which is 36, 72, etc. So the options are possible multiples of X.\n\nBut the options are 36,15,17,5,7. So which of these is a multiple of X. So, for example, if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple (36*1), so A is correct. But if X is 72, then none of the options are multiples of 72. So the only possible X that makes any of the options a multiple is X=36, and the option is 36.\n\nSo the correct answer would be A)36.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X, where X is a number that is itself a multiple of both 9 and 12. So, X is a common multiple, so X could be 36, 72, etc. So the options are numbers, and we have to pick which is a multiple of X.\n\nBut without knowing X, perhaps the question is to find the least such X, which is 36, and then see which option is a multiple of 36. So the only option that is a multiple of 36 is 36 itself. So the answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think: X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12. So X must be a common multiple. The smallest such X is 36. So the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X. So if X is 36, the options are 36,15,17,5,7. So 36 is a multiple of 36, so A is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as: which of the options is a multiple of X, and X is a number that is a multiple of both 9 and 12. So X is 36, 72, etc. The options are 36,15,17,5,7. So 36 is a multiple of X only if X is 36. So the answer is A.\n\nAnother way to think: if X is a multiple of both 9 and 12, then X must be a multiple of their LCM, which is 36. So X is 36, 72, etc. The options are 36,15,17,5,7. So which of these is a multiple of X. Let's check each option.\n\nIf the option is 36, then X could be 36, so 36 is a multiple of X. If X were 72, then 36 is not a multiple of 72. So 36 is a multiple of X only if X is 36. So in that case, option A is correct.\n\nBut wait, the options are the possible values of X, or the possible multiples of X? No, the options are the values we need to check if they are multiples of X. So the question is: which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by 9 and 12. So the options are possible multiples of X.\n\nWait, but X could be any common multiple of 9 and 12, like 36, 72, 108, etc. So the options are 36,15,17,5,7. So, which of these is a multiple of X. Let's take each option:\n\nA)36: Is 36 a multiple of X? That would mean X divides into 36. But X is a multiple of 36, as X is a common multiple of 9 and 12. So if X is 36, then yes, 36 is a multiple of X. If X is 72, then 36 is not a multiple of 72. So in that case, it depends on what X is. But the question says \"if it is divisible by 9 and 12,\" which implies X is a common multiple, but perhaps the minimal one. So the minimal X is 36, so 36 is a multiple of X.\n\nSo the correct answer would be A)36.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If X is a number that's divisible by 9 and 12, then X could be 36, 72, 108, etc. So the options are 36,15,17,5,7. The question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X. So, for example, if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple. If X is 72, then none of the options are multiples of 72 because all options are smaller than 72. So the only way for any of the options to be a multiple of X is if X is 36.\n\nSo the answer is A)36.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine which of the given options is a multiple of \\( X \\), where \\( X \\) is a number divisible by both 9 and 12. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the requirements for \\( X \\)\nIf \\( X \\) is divisible by both 9 and 12, it must be a common multiple of these two numbers. The smallest such number is the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12. \n\n- Prime factorization of 9: \\( 3^2 \\)\n- Prime factorization of 12: \\( 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\)\n\nThe LCM is obtained by taking the highest powers of all prime factors:\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(9, 12) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 = 4 \\times 9 = 36\n\\]\nThus, \\( X \\) must be a multiple of 36, such as 36, 72, 108, etc.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the options\nThe options provided are:\n- A) 36\n- B) 15\n- C) 17\n- D) 5\n- E) 7\n\nWe need to determine which of these is a multiple of \\( X \\). Since \\( X \\) is a multiple of 36, we evaluate each option:\n\n- **Option A (36):** If \\( X = 36 \\), then 36 is a multiple of \\( X \\) (since \\( 36 \\div 36 = 1 \\)).\n- **Option B (15):** 15 is smaller than 36 and not a multiple of 36.\n- **Option C (17):** 17 is smaller than 36 and not a multiple of 36.\n- **Option D (5):** 5 is smaller than 36 and not a multiple of 36.\n- **Option E (7):** 7 is smaller than 36 and not a multiple of 36.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\nThe only option that satisfies the condition is 36, which is a multiple of \\( X \\) when \\( X = 36 \\). For larger multiples of 36 (e.g., 72, 108), none of the options would be multiples of \\( X \\). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",
