      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a telephone bill, and I need to figure out what the bill would be for a certain number of calls. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe problem says the bill is partly fixed and partly varies with the number of calls. Hmm, that sounds like a linear equation where the total bill is a function of both a fixed cost and a variable cost per call. So I think the formula would be something like Total Bill = Fixed Cost + (Variable Cost per Call \u00d7 Number of Calls).\n\nThey've given me two scenarios. In the first month, 540 calls led to a bill of Rs.1800. In the second month, 620 calls resulted in Rs.2040. I need to find the fixed cost and the variable cost per call.\n\nLet me assign variables to make this easier. Let's say F is the fixed cost, and V is the variable cost per call. So the equations would be:\n\nFor the first month: F + 540V = 1800. (Equation 1)\nFor the second month: F + 620V = 2040. (Equation 2)\n\nNow I have two equations with two variables. I can solve them simultaneously to find F and V.\n\nIf I subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2, the F terms will cancel out. Let's see:\n\n(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800\nF cancels, so 620V - 540V = 240\nThat gives 80V = 240 \u2192 V = 240 /80 = 3.\n\nSo the variable cost per call is Rs.3. Now plug this back into Equation 1 to find F.\n\nF + 540*3 = 1800\n540 *3 is 1620. So F +1620 =1800 \u2192 F= 1800-1620=180.\n\nSo the fixed cost is Rs.180, and the variable cost is Rs.3 per call.\n\nNow the question is, what's the bill when 500 calls are made? Using the same formula.\n\nTotal Bill = F + (V \u00d7 Calls)\n= 180 + (3 \u00d7500)\n3*500 is 1500. So 180+1500=1680.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 1680. So the answer should be B.\n",
