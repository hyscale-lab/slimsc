      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out how far I can go with $8.50 in a cab that charges a specific rate. Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. Then, for each additional quarter-mile, it's 10 cents. Hmm, so the initial charge covers the first quarter, and each extra part after that is 0.10 dollars per quarter-mile.\n\nSo, the total money I have is $8.50. Let me subtract the initial charge first to see how much is left for the additional distance.\n\n$8.50 minus $3.50 equals $5.00. So I have $5 left for the extra quarters.\n\nEach extra quarter-mile costs $0.10. So I can find out how many extra quarter-miles I can get by dividing $5 by $0.10.\n\n$5 divided by $0.10 is 50. So that's 50 quarter-miles after the initial one.\n\nWait, wait, so the first quarter is included in the initial charge. So the total distance would be the first quarter plus 50 quarters. Let me calculate that.\n\nOne quarter-mile is 0.25 miles. So the initial part is 0.25 miles. The additional 50 quarter-miles would be 50 * 0.25 = 12.5 miles.\n\nAdding them together: 0.25 + 12.5 = 12.75 miles. So that's the total distance I can travel.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12.75 miles. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. Initial charge is $3.50, so $8.50 - $3.50 is indeed $5.00. $5 divided by $0.10 is 50, so 50 quarter-miles. Each quarter is 0.25 miles, so 50 * 0.25 is 12.5. Plus the initial 0.25 makes 12.75. That looks correct.\n\nSo yeah, the maximum distance is 12.75 miles, which is option B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 in a cab that charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and $0.10 for each additional quarter-mile, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Subtract the initial charge**: The first quarter-mile costs $3.50.
