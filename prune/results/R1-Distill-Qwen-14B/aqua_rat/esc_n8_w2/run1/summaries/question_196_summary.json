      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: An electric pole that's 14 meters high casts a shadow of 10 meters. We need to find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 meters under similar conditions. The options are A)21, B)22, C)20, D)23, E)24.\n\nHmm, right. So, similar conditions usually mean similar triangles, I think. Because the sun's angle would be the same for both the pole and the tree, right? So the triangles formed by their heights and shadows would be similar. \n\nWait, similar triangles have their sides proportional. So I can set up a ratio here. Let's see. The electric pole's height is 14 m, and its shadow is 10 m. The tree's shadow is 15 m, and I need to find its height, let's call it h.\n\nSo the ratio of the pole's height to its shadow should be the same as the tree's height to its shadow. So:\n\n14 / 10 = h / 15.\n\nWait, is that right? Or should I flip them? Oh, because both are height over shadow, so yeah, same ratio.\n\nSo solving for h, I can cross-multiply. 14 * 15 = 10 * h.\n\nLet me calculate that. 14 times 15... 14*10 is 140, and 14*5 is 70, so 140+70=210. So 210 equals 10h. Then h = 210 /10 =21.\n\nSo the height should be 21 meters. Looking at the options, A is 21. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, did I get the ratio right? Another way to think: If the pole is 14m with 10m shadow, and the tree is 15m shadow, which is 1.5 times longer than the pole's shadow. So the tree's height should be 1.5 times the pole's height. 14 *1.5 is 21. Yep, same result. So definitely A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about shadows and heights. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with shadows and similar triangles, the ratios should be the same. Wait, let me think. So, the electric pole is 14 meters high and its shadow is 10 meters. The tree's shadow is 15 meters, and I need to find its height.\n\nI think I should set up a proportion here. Like, the height of the object over the length of its shadow should be the same for both the pole and the tree because the sun's angle is the same, right? So the ratio for the pole is 14/10. For the tree, it's h/15, where h is the height I'm trying to find.\n\nSo the equation would be 14/10 = h/15. To solve for h, I can cross-multiply. 14 times 15 equals 10 times h. Let me calculate that. 14 *15 is 210. And 10 times h is 10h. So 210 = 10h. Dividing both sides by 10 gives h = 21.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option A is 21.
