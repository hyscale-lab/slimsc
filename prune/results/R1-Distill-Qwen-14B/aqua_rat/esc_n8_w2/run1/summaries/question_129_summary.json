      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the difference between the squares of two numbers is 256,000, and the sum of the numbers is 1000. I need to find which pair of numbers fits these conditions. The options are A to E, with E being that it can't be determined or none of the given options are correct.\n\nHmm, right. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with the difference of squares, there's a formula that could help. Oh right, the difference of squares of two numbers a and b is a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). That's a useful identity.\n\nSo the problem gives me that a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 256,000 and a + b = 1000. Let me write that down:\n\na + b = 1000\na\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 256,000\n\nSince a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 is (a - b)(a + b), I can substitute the known sum into this. So:\n\n(a - b)(a + b) = 256,000\nBut a + b is 1000, so substituting that in:\n\n(a - b)(1000) = 256,000\n\nI can solve for (a - b) by dividing both sides by 1000:\n\na - b = 256,000 / 1000\nWhich simplifies to 256.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n1. a + b = 1000\n2. a - b = 256\n\nNow, I can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b. Let me add these two equations together.\n\nAdding equation 1 and equation 2:\n\n(a + b) + (a - b) = 1000 + 256\n2a = 1256\nSo a = 1256 / 2 = 628.\n\nNow that I have a, I can find b by subtracting equation 2 from equation 1, or just plugging a into one of the equations. Let's do it both ways for verification.\n\nUsing equation 1: a + b = 1000\n628 + b = 1000\nb = 1000 - 628 = 372.\n\nAlternatively, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n(a + b) - (a - b) = 1000 - 256\n2b = 744\nb = 744 / 2 = 372.\n\nYes, that matches. So the two numbers are 628 and 372.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 628 and 372. So that should be the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, another way to check is to compute a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 and see if it equals 256,000.\n\nCalculating a\u00b2: 628 squared. Let's compute 628^2. Hmm, 600^2 is 360,000. 28^2 is 784. And the cross term is 2*(600)*(28) = 33,600. So 628^2 = (600+28)^2 = 600\u00b2 + 2*600*28 + 28\u00b2 = 360000 + 33600 + 784 = 360000 + 33600 is 393,600. 393,600 + 784 = 394,384.\n\nSimilarly, 372 squared. Let's compute that. 370^2 is 136,900. 2^2 is 4. Cross term is 2*(370)*(2) = 1,480. So (370+2)^2 = 370\u00b2 + 2*370*2 + 2\u00b2 = 136900 + 1480 +4 = 136900 + 1480 is 138,380 +4 is 138,384.\n\nNow subtracting b\u00b2 from a\u00b2: 394,384 - 138,384 = 256,000. Oh, that's correct. So the numbers are indeed 628 and 372.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is 628 and 372, so the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me check the other options just to be thorough. Option C is 640 and 360. Let's see if their squares fit.\n\nCompute 640^2: 409,600. 360^2 is 129,600. The difference would be 409600 - 129600 = 280,000. Which is more than 256,000, so that's not correct.\n\nOption A: 600 and 400. 600^2 is 360,000. 400^2 is 160,000. The difference is 200,000, which is less than 256,000. So that's not it.\n\nOption C's difference is higher, so it's not the right pair. So the only correct option is B.\n",

Their squares: 600\u00b2=360000, 400\u00b2=160000. Difference is 200,000, which is less than 256,000. So that's not correct.\n\nSo yeah, only option B works. So the answer is B.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding two numbers whose sum is 1000 and whose difference of squares is 256,000. Using the difference of squares formula, \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\), and substituting \\(a + b = 1000\\), we find:\n\n\\[\n(a - b) \\cdot 1000 = 256000 \\implies a - b = \\frac{256000}{1000} = 256.\n\\]\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n1. \\(a + b = 1000\\),\n2. \\(a - b = 256\\).\n\nAdding these equations gives:\n\\[\n(a + b) + (a - b) = 1000 + 256 \\implies 2a = 1256 \\implies a = 628.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(a = 628\\) into \\(a + b = 1000\\) gives:\n\\[\nb = 1000 - 628 = 372.\n\\]\n\nThus, the numbers are 628 and 372. To verify, calculate their squares:\n- \\(628^2 = 394384\\),\n- \\(372^2 = 138384\\).\n\nThe difference is:\n\\[\n628^2 - 372^2 = 394384 - 138384 = 256000,\n\\]\nwhich matches the given condition. Checking the options, only option B (628, 372) satisfies both conditions. Other options, such as A (600, 400) and C (640, 360), do not yield the correct difference of squares. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: B",
