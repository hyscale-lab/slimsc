      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: Two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. The smaller number is? The options are A)21, B)33, C)35, D)42, E)58.\n\nHmm. Alright, so the two numbers are in a ratio of 3 to 5. Let me think about how to represent that. Ratios can be expressed with variables. Maybe I can let the two numbers be 3x and 5x, where x is a common multiplier. That makes sense because 3x:5x is the same as 3:5.\n\nSo, the first number is 3x and the second is 5x. Now, the problem says that if 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio becomes 12:23. So, subtracting 9 from both gives (3x-9) and (5x-9), and their ratio is 12:23.\n\nI need to set up an equation to solve for x. So, the equation would be:\n\n(3x - 9)/(5x - 9) = 12/23\n\nCross-multiplying to solve for x. Let me write that out.\n\n23*(3x - 9) = 12*(5x - 9)\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n23*3x is 69x, and 23*(-9) is -207. On the right side, 12*5x is 60x, and 12*(-9) is -108.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n69x - 207 = 60x - 108\n\nNow, I'll subtract 60x from both sides to get:\n\n69x -60x -207 = -108\n9x -207 = -108\n\nNext, add 207 to both sides:\n\n9x = -108 + 207\n\nLet me calculate that: 207 minus 108 is 99. So,\n\n9x = 99\n\nDivide both sides by 9:\n\nx = 11\n\nWait, x is 11. Now, the original numbers were 3x and 5x. So the smaller number is 3x, which is 3*11=33. So the smaller number is 33.\n\nWait, but let me check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me plug x=11 back into the original equation.\n\nOriginal numbers: 33 and 55. Subtract 9 from each: 24 and 46. Are those in the ratio 12:23? Let's see. 24 divided by 12 is 2, 46 divided by 23 is 2. So 24:46 simplifies to 12:23, which matches. So that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 33. So the answer should be B.\n",

Let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe question is about two numbers that are in the ratio 3:5. Hmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that ratios compare quantities. So, if two numbers are in the ratio 3:5, I can think of them as 3 parts and 5 parts respectively. But I'm not exactly sure how to translate that into actual numbers yet.\n\nThe problem says that if 9 is subtracted from each of these numbers, the new ratio becomes 12:23. So, after subtracting 9, the smaller number becomes part of a new ratio. I need to find the smaller original number.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's denote the two numbers. Since the ratio is 3:5, I can let the numbers be 3k and 5k, where k is some constant. This is a common approach when dealing with ratios because it allows me to express the numbers in terms of a variable that scales them up or down as needed.\n\nSo, the first number is 3k, and the second is 5k. Now, the problem states that when 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio is 12:23. So, subtracting 9 from both gives us (3k - 9) and (5k - 9). The ratio of these two new numbers is 12:23.\n\nTo set up the equation, I can write this as (3k - 9)/(5k - 9) = 12/23. Cross-multiplying should help me solve for k. Let's do that.\n\nCross-multiplying gives 23*(3k - 9) = 12*(5k - 9). Let me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side: 23*3k = 69k and 23*(-9) = -207. So left side is 69k - 207.\n\nRight side: 12*5k = 60k and 12*(-9) = -108. So right side is 60k - 108.\n\nNow, putting it together: 69k - 207 = 60k - 108.\n\nHmm, I need to solve for k. Let me subtract 60k from both sides to get the k terms on one side.\n\n69k -60k -207 = -108 \u2192 9k -207 = -108.\n\nNext, I'll add 207 to both sides to isolate the term with k.\n\n9k = -108 + 207. Let's compute that: 207 -108 is 99, so 9k = 99.\n\nDividing both sides by 9 gives k = 99 /9 = 11. So k is 11.\n\nNow that I have k, I can find the original numbers. The smaller number is 3k, so 3 *11=33. The larger is 5k=55.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let me plug these back into the subtracted ratio to make sure.\n\nSubtracting 9 from each: 33-9=24, 55-9=46. Now, what's 24:46? Let me simplify that. Both are divisible by 2: 12:23. Oh, that's exactly the ratio given. So that's correct.\n\nSo the smaller number is 33. Looking back at the options, option B is 33. So the answer should be B.\n",
