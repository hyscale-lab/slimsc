      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. A wire is in the shape of a rectangle, with length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm. Then it's rebent to form a square. I need to find the measure of each side of the square. The options are A)9, B)11, C)22, D)25, E)31.\n\nHmm, okay, so the wire is first a rectangle. That means the perimeter of the rectangle is the same as the perimeter of the square because we're just rebending it. Oh right, because the wire's length doesn't change when you reshape it.\n\nSo, I remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2*(length + breadth). Let me plug in the numbers. The length is 27 cm, and the breadth is 17 cm. So 2*(27 +17) equals... let's see, 27 plus 17 is 44, multiplied by 2 is 88. So the perimeter is 88 cm.\n\nNow, when you bend this wire into a square, the perimeter of the square will also be 88 cm. But for a square, all sides are equal. The formula for the perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length. So I can set up an equation: 4 * side = 88 cm.\n\nTo find the side length, I'll divide both sides by 4. 88 divided by 4 is... 22? Because 4 times 20 is 80, and 4 times 2 is 8, so 20 plus 2 is 22. So each side of the square should be 22 cm.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 22. So the answer should be C.\n",

I need to find the length of each side of the square. The options are A)9, B)11, C)22, D)25, E)31.\n\nHmm, I remember that when you bend a wire into different shapes, the total length of the wire stays the same because you're not adding or removing any material. So the perimeter of the rectangle should be equal to the perimeter of the square.\n\nWait, right. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2*(length + breadth). Let me calculate that. The length is 27 cm, and the breadth is 17 cm. So adding those together, 27 + 17 is 44. Multiply by 2, that gives 88 cm.
