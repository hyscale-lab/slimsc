      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about averages and adding a new vehicle. Alright, I think I can handle this.\n\nThe question says that the average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. Then, when a new heavy-duty truck is added, the average increases by 2.6 tons. I need to find the weight of that truck.\n\nWait, okay, let me break this down. So, initially, there are 10 vehicles. Their average is 12.2 tons. So the total weight of all these vehicles together must be 10 times 12.2. Let me calculate that. 10 multiplied by 12.2 is 122 tons. Right, so the total weight is 122 tons.\n\nNow, when the new truck is added, the number of vehicles becomes 11. The average increases by 2.6 tons. So the new average is 12.2 plus 2.6. Let me add those. 12.2 + 2.6 is 14.8 tons. So the new average is 14.8 tons.\n\nSince there are now 11 vehicles, the total weight must be 11 times 14.8. Let me compute that. Hmm, 11 multiplied by 14.8. Wait, 10 times 14.8 is 148, and adding another 14.8 makes it 162.8. So the total weight after adding the truck is 162.8 tons.\n\nBut wait, the original total was 122 tons. So the weight of the new truck must be the difference between the new total and the original total. So that's 162.8 minus 122. Let me do that subtraction. 162.8 minus 122 is 40.8 tons. So the truck's weight is 40.8 tons.\n\nWait a second, but looking at the options, option A is 40.8. So that's the answer, right? Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nLet me double-check the initial total: 10 vehicles at 12.2 average. 10 * 12.2 = 122. Correct. Then, new average is 14.8, 11 vehicles. 11 * 14.8: Let me calculate it again. 10*14.8 is 148, plus 1*14.8 is 14.8. So 148+14.8=162.8. Right. Then, 162.8 - 122 = 40.8. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the truck must weigh 40.8 tons. Looking at the options, A is 40.8. So the answer should be A.\n",

So, initially, there are 10 vehicles with an average of 12.2 tons. So the total weight for these 10 is 10 multiplied by 12.2.
