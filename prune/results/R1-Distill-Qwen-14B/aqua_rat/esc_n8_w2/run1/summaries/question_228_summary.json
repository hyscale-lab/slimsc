      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about balls in a box. Let me read it again. The box has balls numbered from 1 to n. The question is about the number of ways to select two balls such that the ball numbered 3 is not selected. And they tell me there are 45 different ways. I need to find what n is.\n\nHmm, alright. So first, I remember that when selecting two items from a set, the number of combinations is given by the combination formula. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n-k)! ), where n is the total number of items, and k is how many you're choosing.\n\nIn this case, we're choosing two balls, so k is 2. But there's a condition: the ball numbered 3 shouldn't be selected. So I need to find the number of ways to choose two balls without including ball 3.\n\nWait, how do I approach that? Well, maybe I can think of it as the total number of ways to choose any two balls minus the number of ways that include ball 3. Because if I subtract the cases where 3 is selected, I'll get the cases where it's not.\n\nSo the total number of ways to choose any two balls is C(n, 2). The number of ways that include ball 3 is C(n-1, 1) because once you've chosen ball 3, you need to choose one more from the remaining n-1 balls. Or wait, wait, maybe I should think of it as when you have to include 3, you pair it with each of the other balls. So that's (n-1) ways, right? Because there are n-1 other balls.\n\nSo the number of valid selections (without 3) is total minus those that include 3. So:\n\nNumber of ways without 3 = C(n, 2) - (n-1)\n\nAnd according to the problem, this equals 45.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nC(n, 2) - (n-1) = 45\n\nLet me compute C(n, 2). That's (n*(n-1))/2. So:\n\n(n(n-1)/2) - (n-1) = 45\n\nHmm, I can factor out (n-1):\n\n(n-1)(n/2 - 1) ) =45\n\nWait, let me check that. Let's write it as:\n\n(n(n-1)/2) - (n-1) = 45\n\nFactor (n-1) from both terms:\n\n(n-1) [ n/2 - 1 ] =45\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should express it as:\n\n(n(n-1) - 2(n-1)) / 2 =45\n\nBecause (n(n-1)/2) is the first term, and subtracting (n-1) is like subtracting 2(n-1)/2. So:\n\n[ n(n-1) - 2(n-1) ] / 2 =45\n\nFactor (n-1) in numerator:\n\n(n-1)(n - 2)/2 =45\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n(n-1)(n-2)/2 =45\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n(n-1)(n-2) =90\n\nNow I have to solve for n in this equation.\n\nExpanding the left side: n\u00b2 -3n +2 =90\n\nThen subtract 90 from both sides: n\u00b2 -3n -88=0\n\nSo the quadratic equation is n\u00b2 -3n -88=0.\n\nLet me try to factor this. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -88 and add to -3.\n\nHmm, 8 and -11? Because 8*(-11)=-88, and 8 + (-11)= -3. Yes, that works.\n\nSo the equation factors as (n +8)(n -11)=0.\n\nSo the solutions are n=-8 or n=11. Since n can't be negative, n=11.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes when you set up equations, you might have made a mistake in the setup.\n\nLet me verify the initial setup. The number of ways without 3 is 45.\n\nTotal ways: C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2\n\nWays with 3: n-1 (since you pair 3 with each of the other n-1 balls)\n\nSo without 3: C(n,2) - (n-1) =45.\n\nWhich leads to (n(n-1)/2) - (n-1) =45.\n\nWhich we simplified to (n-1)(n-2)/2 =45.\n\nMultiply by 2: (n-1)(n-2)=90.\n\nLooking for two consecutive numbers (since n-1 and n-2 are consecutive) that multiply to 90.\n\nWait, 9 and 10 multiply to 90, because 9*10=90.\n\nSo n-2=9 \u2192 n=11; n-1=10.\n\nYes, that fits.\n\nSo n=11.

So, the key here is that when we choose two balls, we can't pick the one with number 3. That means we're selecting two balls from the remaining balls. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nI remember that the number of ways to choose two items from a set is calculated using combinations. The formula for combinations is C(k, m) = m! / (k! (m-k)!), where m is the total number of items, and k is the number we're choosing.\n\nWait, in this case, since we can't pick the ball numbered 3, the total number of balls available for selection is n-1. Because the total was originally n balls, but we exclude one (ball 3). So, the number of ways to choose two balls without ball 3 is C(n-1, 2).\n\nThe problem states that this number is 45. So, I can set up the equation:\n\nC(n-1, 2) = 45.\n\nNow, substituting the combination formula, that becomes:\n\n(n-1)(n-2)/(2) = 45.\n\nBecause C(k, 2) is k*(k-1)/2.\n\nSo, let's write that out:\n\n(n-1)(n-2) / 2 = 45.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n(n-1)(n-2) = 90.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for n. Let's expand the left side:\n\nn^2 - 3n + 2 = 90.\n\nSubtract 90 from both sides to set the equation to zero:\n\nn^2 - 3n + 2 - 90 = 0 \u2192 n^2 -3n -88 = 0.\n\nWait, wait, let me check that again. Expanding (n-1)(n-2) gives n\u00b2 -3n +2. So subtracting 90 gives n\u00b2 -3n +2 -90 = n\u00b2 -3n -88 = 0.\n\nSo, the quadratic equation is n\u00b2 -3n -88 = 0.\n\nI can solve this using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is n = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 352)] / 2 because the equation is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, where a=1, b=-3, c=-88. So, discriminant D is b\u00b2 -4ac \u2192 (-3)^2 -4*(1)*(-88) = 9 + 352 = 361.\n\nSquare root of 361 is 19. So,\n\nn = [3 \u00b1 19]/2.\n\nSo, two possible solutions:\n\nn = (3 +19)/2 = 22/2 =11,\n\nn = (3-19)/2 = (-16)/2 = -8.\n\nBut n can't be negative, so n=11 is the solution.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct.
