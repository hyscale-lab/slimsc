      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the cost price of an article that a trader sold for Rs.360 with a 20% profit. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nWait, profit is calculated based on the cost price, right? So the selling price is the cost plus 20% of the cost. Let me try to write that down. Oh right, profit is 20% of the cost price, so the selling price (SP) is cost price (CP) plus 20% of CP. Alternatively, that's the same as 120% of the CP.\n\nSo the formula I remember is SP = CP + (Profit % \u00d7 CP). Or SP = CP \u00d7 (1 + Profit%). Since the profit is 20%, that's 1.2 times the CP. \n\nGiven that the selling price is 360 Rs, I can set up the equation: 360 = CP \u00d7 1.2. Oh wait, I need to find CP, so I should rearrange this. CP would be 360 divided by 1.2.\n\nLet me do the math. 360 divided by 1.2. Hmm, 1.2 times 300 is 360 because 300 \u00d7 1.2 is 360. So the cost price must be 300 Rs. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 300. So that's the correct answer.\n",

Hmm, I remember that profit is calculated based on the cost price, right? Let me think.\n\nThe selling price is given as Rs. 360, and the profit is 20%. So, I guess the selling price includes the cost plus 20% of the cost. Oh wait, so the formula for selling price when there's a profit is Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit. And profit is 20% of the cost, so Profit = 20% of Cost Price.\n\nSo putting that together, Selling Price = Cost Price + (20% of Cost Price). That can be written as SP = CP * (1 + 20/100). Oh right, 20% as a decimal is 0.2, so 1 + 0.2 is 1.2. So SP = 1.2 * CP.\n\nWait, the selling price is 360. So 360 = 1.2 * CP. To find CP, I need to divide both sides by 1.2. Let me calculate that. 360 divided by 1.2. Hmm, 360 divided by 1.2. Let's see, 360 divided by 1 is 360, so 1.2 is 12/10, so dividing by 1.2 is same as multiplying by 10/12. So 360 * (10/12) = ?\n\nWait, 360 divided by 12 is 30, so 30 multiplied by 10 is 300. Oh, right! So the cost price is 300. Let me double-check that. If the cost is 300, then 20% of 300 is 60. So 300 + 60 is 360, which matches the selling price given. That makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 300. So the correct answer should be B.\n",
