      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, so it's about a factory producing staplers, and there are some percentages involved. I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nSo, the question says that 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. That means out of all the staplers made, 10% are defective and the rest, 90%, are non-defective. Got it. Then, it mentions that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Wait, so these are good staplers but were mistakenly rejected. And the number of such rejected ones is 72. The question is asking for the total number of staplers produced that day.\n\nLet me think. Let's break it down. Let's say the total number of staplers produced is N. So, 10% of N are defective. That leaves 90% as non-defective. So, the number of non-defective staplers is 0.9 * N.\n\nNow, 2% of these non-defective ones were rejected. So, 2% of 0.9N equals 72. Let me write that as an equation: 0.02 * (0.9N) = 72. Hmm, okay.\n\nLet me compute the left side. 0.02 times 0.9 is 0.018. So, 0.018 * N = 72. I need to solve for N. So, N equals 72 divided by 0.018.\n\nWait, what's 72 divided by 0.018? Let me calculate that. Hmm, 72 divided by 0.018. Let me think, 0.018 is 18 thousandths, so 72 divided by 18 is 4, but since it's thousandths, it's 72 / 0.018 = 72 * (1000/18) = (72 * 1000)/18. Let me compute that. 72 divided by 18 is 4, so 4 times 1000 is 4000. Oh, wait no, wait, no, that can't be right. Because 0.018 is 18/1000. So, 72 divided by (18/1000) is 72 * (1000/18) = (72/18)*1000. 72 divided by 18 is 4, so 4*1000=4000. So N is 4000. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, option A is 4000. But let me double-check because sometimes I might make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check my math again. 0.02 is 2%, so 2% of 0.9N is 72. So 0.02 * 0.9N = 72. So 0.018 N =72. N =72 /0.018. Let me compute 72 \u00f7 0.018.\n\nAnother way: 0.018 is 1.8 \u00d7 10^-2. So 72 divided by 0.018 is the same as 72 divided by 1.8, then multiplied by 100. Because 1.8 \u00d7 100 = 180, so 1.8 \u00d7 100 is 180? Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me do it step by step.\n\n72 divided by 0.018. Let me multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals. That gives 72000 divided by 18. Now, 72000 \u00f718. Let's compute that. 18 \u00d7 4000 is 72,000. So yes, N is 4000. So the total number of staplers is 4000. So the correct answer should be A)4,000.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 4,000. So why is option B 4,200, etc.? Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me read the question again.\n\nOh wait, no, the question says 2% of the non-defective were rejected. So I think my calculation is correct. So N is 4,000. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The non-defective staplers are 90% of N. So 0.9N. 2% of that is 0.02*(0.9N) = 0.018N. That's equal to 72. So N =72/0.018=4000. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is A.\n",

So, 72 divided by (18/1000) is 72 * (1000/18) = (72/18)*1000. 72 divided by 18 is 4, so 4*1000=4000. So N is 4000. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, option A is 4000.

Then, 2 percent of the non-defective ones were rejected by mistake. And they told us that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. We need to find the total number of staplers produced that day. The options are A to E, with numbers ranging from 4,000 to 5,000. \n\nWait, let me break this down. Let's denote the total number of staplers produced as T. So, 10% are defective, which is 0.10*T. That leaves 90% as non-defective, which is 0.90*T. \n\nBut then, 2% of these non-defective ones were rejected. So, the number of rejected non-defectives is 2% of 0.90*T. And that's given as 72. So mathematically, that would be 0.02 * (0.90*T) = 72. \n\nLet me write that equation out. 0.02 * 0.9T = 72. Let me compute 0.02 * 0.9 first. 0.02 times 0.9 is 0.018. So, 0.018*T equals 72. \n\nTo find T, I need to divide both sides by 0.018. So T = 72 / 0.018. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 72 divided by 0.018. I can think of it as 72 multiplied by (1/0.018). \n\nWait, 0.018 is the same as 18/1000, so 1/0.018 is 1000/18. Let me compute 72 * (1000/18). Let's see, 72 divided by 18 is 4, because 18 times 4 is 72. So 4 * 1000 is 4000. \n\nSo T is 4000? Let me double-check that. If T is 4000, then 10% defective is 400, leaving 3600 non-defective.
