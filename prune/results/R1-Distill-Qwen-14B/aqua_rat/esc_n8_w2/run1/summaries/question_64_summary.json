      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about Sachin's batting average in the IPL. Hmm, let's see. The question says that his current batting average is 51. Then in the finals, he scores 78 runs, and his average goes up to 54. I need to find out how many matches he played in this season.\n\nWait, I remember that batting average is calculated by dividing the total runs scored by the number of innings (matches, I think). So, average = total runs / number of matches.\n\nLet me denote the number of matches he played before the finals as 'n'. His average before the finals was 51, so his total runs would be 51 multiplied by n. \n\nThen, in the finals, he scored 78 runs. So the new total runs would be 51n + 78. And the number of matches now is n + 1, since he played one more match.\n\nThe new average is 54. So the equation would be:\n\n(51n + 78) / (n + 1) = 54.\n\nI need to solve this equation for n.\n\nLet's rearrange the equation. Multiply both sides by (n + 1):\n\n51n + 78 = 54(n + 1).\n\nExpanding the right side: 54n + 54.\n\nSo, 51n +78 =54n +54.\n\nLet me subtract 51n from both sides: 78 =3n +54.\n\nThen subtract 54 from both sides: 24=3n.\n\nSo n = 8.\n\nWait, n is the number of matches before the finals. So the total matches now are n + 1, which is 8 + 1 =9. So the answer should be 9 matches. Looking at the options, option C is 9. So the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let's plug n=8 into the initial equation.\n\nTotal runs before finals: 51*8=408. After finals, 408 +78=486 runs. Number of matches:9. 486/9=54, which matches the given average. Yep, that's correct. So the total number of matches is 9. So the answer is option C.\n",
