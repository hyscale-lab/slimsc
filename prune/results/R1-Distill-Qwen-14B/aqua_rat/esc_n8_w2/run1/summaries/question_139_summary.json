      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two cars and their speeds. Hmm, I need to find the difference in their speeds. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, speed is basically distance divided by time, right? So for each car, I can calculate their speeds separately and then subtract them to find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's tackle Car X. The problem says it covers 320 kms in 8 hours. So I'll take the distance, which is 320, and divide it by time, 8. Let me do that calculation. 320 divided by 8 is... let me see, 8 times 40 is 320. Oh, so Car X's speed is 40 km/hr.\n\nNext up is Car Y. It goes 415 kms in 5 hours. So again, distance over time. That's 415 divided by 5. Let me compute that. 5 times 80 is 400, so 415 minus 400 is 15. 15 divided by 5 is 3. So 80 plus 3 is 83. So Car Y's speed is 83 km/hr.\n\nNow I need the difference between the two speeds. So I subtract Car X's speed from Car Y's. That's 83 minus 40. Let me see, 83 minus 40 is 43. So the difference is 43 km/hr.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 43 km/hr. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. Car X: 320/8=40, correct. Car Y: 415/5. 5*83 is 415, yes. 83-40=43. Yep, that's right. So the answer should be option C.\n",

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, the question says Car X covers 320 kms in 8 hours. Car Y covers 415 kms in 5 hours. I need to find the difference in their speeds. Hmm, right, speed is distance divided by time.\n\nSo for Car X, speed would be 320 km divided by 8 hours. Let me calculate that. 320 divided by 8 is... wait, 8 times 40 is 320, so that's 40 km/h. Got it.\n\nThen Car Y goes 415 km in 5 hours. So its speed is 415 divided by 5. Let me do that. 5 times 80 is 400, and 415 minus 400 is 15. So 15 divided by 5 is 3. So 80 plus 3 is 83 km/h. Oh, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 5 times 83 is 415? Let me check. 5*80=400, 5*3=15, so yes, 400+15=415. So Car Y's speed is 83 km/h.\n\nNow, the question asks for the difference in their speeds. So I subtract the two speeds. Let's see: 83 minus 40. That's 43. So the difference is 43 km/h.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 43 km/h. So the answer should be C. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nCar X: 320/8 = 40. Correct. Car Y: 415/5 = 83. Correct. 83-40=43. Yep. So the difference is 43, which is option C.\n",
