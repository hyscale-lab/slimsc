      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a train's journey, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe train is initially running at 100 miles per hour and it takes 10 hours to reach its destination. Hmm, wait, so if it's going at 100 mph for 10 hours, that means the total distance must be 100 multiplied by 10, right? So 100 * 10 is 1000 miles. Oh wait, no, wait a second. No, wait, because in the problem, the train only starts raining after covering a quarter of the distance, and then slows down. So maybe the 10 hours is the original time before any rain? Or is it the total time? Wait, the way the question is phrased: \"A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination.\" So that's the initial condition. So the total distance is 100 mph * 10 hours = 1000 miles.\n\nBut then, after covering a quarter of the distance, it starts raining. So a quarter of 1000 miles is 250 miles. So the train covers the first 250 miles at 100 mph. Then, for the remaining three quarters, which is 750 miles, it slows down to 75 mph.\n\nWait, so the journey is divided into two parts. The first part is 250 miles at 100 mph, and the second part is 750 miles at 75 mph. I need to calculate the time taken for each part and add them together to find the total duration.\n\nSo let's calculate the time for the first part. Time equals distance divided by speed. So 250 miles divided by 100 mph. 250/100 is 2.5 hours. That makes sense, 2.5 hours for the first quarter.\n\nNow the second part is 750 miles at 75 mph. Time is 750 / 75. Let me calculate that. 75 times 10 is 750, so that's 10 hours. Oh wait, wait, 75 *10 is 750, so 750 divided by 75 is 10 hours. So the second part takes 10 hours.\n\nAdding both times together: 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.5 hours.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The original journey time was 10 hours when the entire distance was covered at 100 mph. But in this case, the train is taking longer because part of the journey is slower. So the total time should be more than 10 hours. So 12.5 hours is the correct total time.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 12.5. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First part: 250 miles at 100 mph. Time is 250/100=2.5. Correct. Second part: 750 miles at 75 mph. 750/75=10. So 2.5 +10=12.5. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be option C, 12.5 hours.\n",

The train is going at 100 miles per hour and takes 10 hours to reach its destination normally. So first, maybe I should find out the total distance of the journey.\n\nWait, right. If speed is 100 mph and time is 10 hours, distance is speed multiplied by time. So 100 * 10 = 1000 miles. Oh, so the total distance is 1000 miles.\n\nBut wait, the question says that after covering a quarter of the distance, it starts raining, and the speed drops to 75 mph. So I need to split the journey into two parts.\n\nFirst part: quarter of the distance. So a quarter of 1000 is 250 miles. The train covers this first part at 100 mph. How long does that take? Time is distance over speed. So 250 / 100 = 2.5 hours. So that's the time for the first part.\n\nThe second part is the remaining three quarters of the distance. Which is 1000 - 250 = 750 miles. But now the speed is 75 mph. So the time taken for the second part is 750 / 75. Let me calculate that. 750 divided by 75 is 10. So 10 hours.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The original time was 10 hours for the whole trip at 100 mph. So if the first part takes 2.5 hours and the second 10 hours, total time is 2.5 + 10 = 12.5 hours. So the total journey duration would be 12.5 hours.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 12.5. So that should be the correct answer.\n",
