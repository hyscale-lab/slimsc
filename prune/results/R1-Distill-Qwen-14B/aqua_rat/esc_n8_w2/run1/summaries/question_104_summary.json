      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Karan wants to mark up a sewing machine. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe problem says the cost price is Rs. 1200. He offers a 20% discount on the marked price, and after that discount, he still makes a 20% profit. I need to find the marked price. The options are given, but I'll try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that profit is calculated based on the cost price. So, a 20% profit on the cost price would be 20% of 1200. Let me calculate that. 20% of 1200 is 0.2 * 1200 = 240. So the selling price after discount should be 1200 + 240 = 1440. Because that's the amount he gets after the discount, and that gives him the 20% profit.\n\nWait, no, actually, the selling price after discount is the amount he sells it for, which is cost plus profit. So yes, selling price is 1440.\n\nBut the selling price is after a 20% discount on the marked price. So the marked price is higher than the selling price. Let me think. If the discount is 20%, that means the selling price is 80% of the marked price. Because if you take 20% off, you're left with 80%.\n\nSo let me denote the marked price as M. After 20% discount, the selling price (S) is M * (1 - 0.2) = 0.8 * M. We know that S is 1440, so 0.8 * M = 1440.\n\nTo find M, I can rearrange that. M = 1440 / 0.8. Let me calculate that. 1440 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 1440 * (5/4) = ?\n\n1440 divided by 4 is 360, multiplied by 5 is 1800. So M should be 1800.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 1800. So that's one of the choices. Let me just double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nCost price: 1200. Profit needed: 20%, so 20% of 1200 is 240. Selling price after discount is 1440. The discount is 20%, so the selling price is 80% of the marked price. 1440 is 80% of M. So M is 1440 / 0.8 = 1800. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is E) 1,800.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Karan and his sewing machine. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slowly.\n\nAlright, the question says that the cost price of the sewing machine is Rs. 1200. Karan wants to set a selling price such that even after giving a 20% discount, he still makes a 20% profit. Hmm, okay.\n\nWait, so he's going to offer a discount, but he still wants a profit. So I think I need to calculate the selling price before the discount and after the discount. Or maybe the other way around. Let me think.\n\nLet me outline what I know:\n\n- Cost price (CP) = Rs. 1200\n- Desired profit = 20% on CP\n- Discount offered = 20%\n\nSo, he wants a 20% profit on the cost price. That means his selling price after the discount should be 120% of the CP, right? Because 100% is the cost, and 20% profit makes it 120%.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me clarify. Profit is calculated on the cost price. So profit amount = 20% of 1200. Let me calculate that.\n\n20% of 1200 is (20/100)*1200 = 240. So the selling price after discount should be CP + profit = 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440. So after the discount, he sells it for 1440.\n\nBut that's after giving a 20% discount. So that 1440 is 80% of the marked price. Because if he offers 20% discount, the customer pays 80% of the marked price.\n\nSo, marked price is the original price before discount. Let me denote it as M. So, 80% of M equals 1440.\n\nSo, 0.8 * M = 1440.\n\nTo find M, I can rearrange this: M = 1440 / 0.8.\n\nHmm, what's 1440 divided by 0.8? Let me calculate. 0.8 is the same as 4/5, so dividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 5/4.\n\nSo, 1440 * (5/4) = ?\n\n1440 divided by 4 is 360. 360 multiplied by 5 is 1800. So M is 1800.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 1800. But let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A)1879, B)1875, C)1876, D)1872, E)1800.\n\nSo E is 1800, which is what I calculated.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the profit calculation. Oh, right, profit is on CP, which is correct. So the selling price after discount is 1200 + 20% of 1200 = 1440. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: The marked price should be such that after a 20% discount, the selling price gives a 20% profit.\n\nSo, selling price (SP) = Marked Price (MP) * (1 - discount rate).\n\nSP = MP * 0.8.\n\nBut SP should also equal the cost plus 20% profit: SP = 1200 * 1.2 = 1440.\n\nSo 0.8 * MP = 1440 \u2192 MP = 1440 / 0.8 = 1800.
