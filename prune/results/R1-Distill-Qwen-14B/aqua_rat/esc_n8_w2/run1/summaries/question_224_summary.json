      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about discounts on tyres, and I need to figure out the total discount. Hmm, let's see. The manufacturer is offering a 20% discount, and then a retailer is adding another 20% off. Wait, but how do these discounts stack up? I think I remember that discounts don't just add up linearly because the second discount is applied after the first one.\n\nWait, so let me break it down. Suppose the original price of the tyre is, say, $100. It's easier to work with 100 because percentages are straightforward. So, the manufacturer's discount is 20%. That means the price after the manufacturer's discount would be 100 minus 20% of 100. 20% of 100 is 20, so the new price is $80.\n\nNow, the retailer is offering an additional 20% discount on top of that. But wait, is that 20% off the original price or the already discounted price? I think it's the latter. So the second discount is 20% off the $80. Let's calculate that. 20% of 80 is 16. So the price after the retailer's discount would be 80 - 16 = $64.\n\nSo the total price after both discounts is $64. The original was $100, so the total discount is 100 - 64 = $36. To find the percentage discount, I divide 36 by 100, which is 0.36, so 36%. Wait, but looking at the options, E is 36%. So the total discount is 36%? But wait, that can't be right because 20% plus 20% would seem like 40%, but because the second discount is on a reduced price, it's less.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for successive discounts. I think it's something like the total discount is (100% - (100 - d1)(100 - d2)/100). Let me think. Or wait, maybe the total discount is the sum of the two discounts minus their product. Wait, no. Let me see.\n\nAnother approach: the first discount is 20%, so the remaining is 80% of the original. The second discount is another 20%, so it's 80% of the already discounted price. So overall, the final price is 80% * 80% = 64% of the original. So 100% - 64% = 36% discount in total.\n\nSo the total discount is 36%, which is option E. But wait, the options are given as A)10%, B)25%, C)28%, D)30%, E)36%. So E is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but sometimes people get confused and think that 20% plus 20% is 40%, but that's not correct because the second discount is applied after the first. So yeah, it's 36%.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the total discount available when both the manufacturer's and retailer's discounts are applied, we calculate the successive discounts step-by-step.\n\n1. **Manufacturer's Discount**: The manufacturer offers a 20% discount.

The amount deducted by the retailer is:\n   \\[\n   20\\% \\text{ of } 80 = 0.2 \\times 80 = 16\n   \\]\n   The final price after the retailer's discount is:\n   \\[\n   80 - 16 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Discount**: The original price was $100, and the final price after both discounts is $64.

Then, some retailers are offering additional discounts. The question is, if a retailer gives an extra 20% discount, what's the total discount available there?\n\nWait, I think I remember that when discounts are applied successively, you don't just add them up. Because the second discount is applied after the first has already reduced the price. So, it's not as simple as 20% + 20% equals 40% off. Oh right, that's a common mistake people make.\n\nLet me think with numbers. Suppose the original price of the tyre is $100. That makes the math easy. So, the manufacturer's discount is 20%, which takes the price down to 80% of the original. So, 20% off of $100 is $20, so the price becomes $80 after the first discount.\n\nNow, the retailer is giving an additional 20% discount. But wait, this 20% is not on the original price, it's on the already discounted price of $80. So, what's 20% of $80? That's $16. So, subtracting that from $80 brings the final price down to $64.\n\nWait, but the question is about the total discount. The original was $100, and now it's $64. So, how much discount is that? $100 minus $64 is $36. So, the total discount is 36% of the original price.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 36%. So the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to calculate successive discounts is to multiply the discount factors. The first discount is 20%, which is a factor of 0.8 (since 100% - 20% = 80% = 0.8). The second discount is another 20%, so another 0.8 factor. So 0.8 * 0.8 equals 0.64. That means the final price is 64% of the original, which is a 36% discount. Yep, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo yeah, the correct answer is E) 36%.\n",
