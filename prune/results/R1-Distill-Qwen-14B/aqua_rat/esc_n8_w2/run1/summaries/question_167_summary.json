      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two printers working together. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question says Printer A and Printer B can each print 1/2 page per second. I need to find out how long it'll take them to print 100 pages together.\n\nWait, so each printer's speed is 0.5 pages per second. If they're working together, their rates should add up, right? Because when you have two things working together, you add their individual rates.\n\nSo, Printer A's rate is 0.5 pages/sec, and Printer B's is also 0.5. So together, they should be doing 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 page per second. Oh, that makes sense. So together, they can print one page every second.\n\nNow, the question is about printing 100 pages. If they do 1 page per second, then to get 100 pages, it would take 100 seconds, right? Because 100 pages divided by 1 page per second equals 100 seconds. Wait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait a second, maybe I should think about it differently. Like, the combined rate is 1 page per second, so the time is the total work divided by the combined rate. Time equals work over rate. So 100 pages divided by (0.5 +0.5) pages per second. So 100/(1) = 100 seconds. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 100 seconds. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't get confused with the rates. Each printer does 1/2 a page per second. So in one second, Printer A does 0.5, Printer B does 0.5. Together, 1.0 per second. So yes, 100 pages would take 100 seconds.\n\nI think that's right. So the answer is C.\n",

I'm supposed to find out how long it takes them to print 100 pages together. Hmm, let's think this through.\n\nWait, each printer prints 1/2 page per second. So, in one second, Printer A does 0.5 pages and the same for Printer B. Together, their combined rate should be the sum of both, right? So adding 0.5 and 0.5 gives me 1 page per second combined. Oh, that makes sense.\n\nSo if they work together, they can print 1 page every second. Now, the question is how long for 100 pages. Since they do 1 page per second, 100 pages would take 100 seconds. Let me check the options: option C is 100 seconds. That seems right.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when dealing with rates, it's easy to mix up the units. Each printer's rate is \u00bd page per second. So together, their combined rate is \u00bd + \u00bd = 1 page per second.
