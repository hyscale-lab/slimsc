      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about the height of a room. Hmm, let's see what the question says. The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. Oh right, semi-perimeter would be half the perimeter, I think. So the ratio is height to semi-perimeter equals 2 to 5. Got it.\n\nThen, it costs Rs.260 to paper the walls. The paper is 50 cm wide, and it's priced at Rs.2 per meter. Oh, and they subtract 15 square meters for doors and windows. So the papering cost accounts for the walls minus those areas. \n\nWait, I need to find the height. So the steps probably involve finding the area of the walls, then figuring out the dimensions based on the given ratio. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the cost part. The total cost is Rs.260. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The paper is bought at Rs.2 per meter. Hmm, so each meter of paper costs 2 rupees, and each strip is 0.5 meters wide. So how much area does one meter of paper cover? It would be 0.5 meters wide times 1 meter length, so 0.5 square meters per meter of paper. So for each rupee, you get 0.5/2 = 0.25 square meters? Wait, no. Let me think again. The cost per meter is Rs.2, and each meter of paper is 0.5 m wide and 1 m long. So the area per meter of paper is 0.5 * 1 = 0.5 m\u00b2. So the cost is Rs.2 for 0.5 m\u00b2. So the area per rupee is 0.5 / 2 = 0.25 m\u00b2 per rupee. Or wait, perhaps I should calculate how much paper is used.\n\nWait, the cost is Rs.260. Each meter of paper is Rs.2, so the total length of paper bought is 260 / 2 = 130 meters. Because each meter costs 2, so 260 / 2 = 130 meters. Each strip is 0.5 meters wide, so the total area of paper is 130 m * 0.5 m = 65 m\u00b2. But this includes the area for doors and windows, which is 15 m\u00b2. So the actual wall area is 65 - 15 = 50 m\u00b2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says \"allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows.\" So the paper used is for the walls, but 15 m\u00b2 is subtracted. So the paper covers the walls minus 15 m\u00b2. So the actual wall area is 50 m\u00b2 plus 15 m\u00b2? Or wait, maybe the 15 is subtracted from the paper's area. Let me think. \n\nSo the cost is for papering the walls, but they didn't paper the doors and windows, which have an area of 15 m\u00b2. So the papered area is (wall area) - 15 = the area covered by the paper. So the paper's area is 50 m\u00b2 (from 130 meters * 0.5 m wide) minus 15 m\u00b2? No, that can't be right because the paper is 65 m\u00b2, but the actual walls without doors and windows are 65 - 15 = 50 m\u00b2? Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the total area of the paper is the length bought multiplied by its width. The length bought is 260 / 2 = 130 meters. The width is 0.5 m, so the area is 130 * 0.5 = 65 m\u00b2. But this 65 m\u00b2 is the area used to cover the walls, excluding doors and windows. So the walls' area (including doors and windows) would be 65 m\u00b2 + 15 m\u00b2 = 80 m\u00b2? No, wait, no. Because the paper only covers the walls, and the doors and windows are not part of that. So the paper area is the walls' area minus the doors and windows. So walls' area = paper area + doors and windows area. So 65 m\u00b2 + 15 m\u00b2 = 80 m\u00b2? No, wait, that doesn't make sense because doors and windows are subtracted from the walls. Let me get this straight.\n\nWhen you paper a room, you don't paper the doors and windows. So the area of paper used is equal to the area of the walls minus the area of the doors and windows. So the paper area is (wall area) - 15 m\u00b2. So the wall area = paper area + 15 m\u00b2. The paper area is 65 m\u00b2, so walls = 65 +15 = 80 m\u00b2. So the total wall area is 80 m\u00b2.\n\nWait, but the walls in a room are the four walls. So the area of the walls is 2*(length + breadth)*height. So the area is 2*(l + b)*h. So 2*(l + b)*h = 80 m\u00b2. Hmm.\n\nBut I also know that the height (h) to semi-perimeter (s) ratio is 2:5. What's the semi-perimeter? The perimeter of the room is 2*(l + b), so semi-perimeter is (l + b). So the ratio h : (l + b) is 2:5. So h / (l + b) = 2/5 \u2192 h = (2/5)(l + b).\n\nSo let me denote (l + b) as S. Then h = (2/5) S. So the wall area is 2*S*h = 2*S*(2S/5) ) \u2192 2*S*(2 S/5) = (4 S\u00b2) /5 = 80 m\u00b2. So 4 S\u00b2 /5 = 80 \u2192 S\u00b2 = (80 *5)/4 = 100 \u2192 S =10 meters. So (l + b) =10 m.\n\nThen h = (2/5)*10 =4 meters. So the height is 4 meters. Looking at the options, option C is 4m. So the answer should be C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding the height of a room. Let's break down the information given.\n\nFirst, the problem says the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. Wait, semi-perimeter usually refers to the perimeter divided by two, right? So, the ratio is height : semi-perimeter = 2:5. Let's denote height as h and semi-perimeter as s. So, h/s = 2/5 \u2192 s = (5/2)h.\n\nWait, but what's the semi-perimeter of a room? Oh, right, the room is a rectangular prism, so the perimeter of the base (floor or ceiling) is 2*(length + width). Therefore, semi-perimeter would be (length + width). Because perimeter is 2(l + w), so semi-perimeter is l + w. So, s = l + w. So, l + w = (5/2)h.\n\nNext part: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls with paper that's 50 cm wide, at Rs.2 per meter. Also, they've allowed an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So, I think I need to calculate the total area of the walls first, subtract the area for doors and windows, and then relate that to the cost.\n\nWait, papering the walls means covering the four walls. The area of the walls is the perimeter multiplied by the height. So, total wall area is 2*(l + w)*h. But wait, since the semi-perimeter is (l + w) = s = (5/2)h, then the perimeter is 2*(l + w) = 2s = 2*(5/2)h) =5h. So, the area of the walls is 5h * h = 5h\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. The perimeter of the base is 2*(l + w), so the perimeter is 2s, where s is the semi-perimeter. So, the area of the four walls is perimeter * height = (2s)*h. But since s is (5/2)h, substituting that in gives 2*(5/2 h) *h \u2192 (5h) * h =5h\u00b2. That's correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the area for doors and windows is 15 sq.m. So, the area of the walls to be covered with paper is (5h\u00b2 - 15).\n\nNow, the cost is Rs.260. Let's see how the cost relates to the area. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost is Rs.2 per meter, but I think that's the cost per linear meter of the paper. So, the cost per square meter would be Rs.2 divided by the width of the paper. Wait, no, wait: when you buy paper, you pay per linear meter. So, each linear meter of paper covers a width of 0.5m. So, the area covered per linear meter is 0.5m * 1m = 0.5 sq.m. But wait, no, because the paper is 50cm wide, so 0.5m. So, each meter of the paper (length) would cover 0.5m * 1m = 0.5 sq.m.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of how much paper is needed. The area to cover is (5h\u00b2 -15) sq.m. The paper is 0.5m wide, so the area of the paper used is length * width. Let me denote the length of paper needed as L meters. Then, the area of paper is L * 0.5 = (5h\u00b2 -15).\n\nSo, L = (5h\u00b2 -15) / 0.5 = 2*(5h\u00b2 -15) = 10h\u00b2 -30 meters.\n\nThe cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. So, total cost is L * 2 = (10h\u00b2 -30)*2 = 20h\u00b2 -60. And this equals Rs.260.\n\nSo, 20h\u00b2 -60 = 260 \u2192 20h\u00b2 = 320 \u2192 h\u00b2 = 16 \u2192 h =4 meters.\n\nWait, that gives h=4, which is option C. But wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, another approach: The area of the walls is 2*(l + w)*h. Since l + w = (5/2)h, then 2*(5/2 h)*h =5h\u00b2. So, the total wall area is 5h\u00b2.\n\nBut the area to be covered is 5h\u00b2 -15. So, the area of paper needed is 5h\u00b2 -15.\n\nThe paper is 50cm wide, so 0.5m wide. The length of the paper required is (5h\u00b2 -15) / 0.5 = 10h\u00b2 -30 meters.\n\nCost per meter is Rs.2, so total cost is (10h\u00b2 -30) *2 = 20h\u00b2 -60 = 260.\n\nSo, 20h\u00b2 =320 \u2192 h\u00b2=16 \u2192 h=4m.\n\nSo the height is 4m, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't confuse anything. Another thing to check: did I correctly account for the doors and windows? Yes, I subtracted 15 sq.m from the total wall area. So that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, could the ratio be something else? Let me think: the ratio of height to semi-perimeter is 2:5, so h/(l +w) =2/5 \u2192 l +w= (5/2)h. That's correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer should be C)4m.\n",

Also, they've allowed an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So, I think I need to calculate the total area of the walls first, subtract the area for doors and windows, and then relate that to the cost.\n\nWait, papering the walls means covering the four walls. The area of the walls is the perimeter multiplied by the height. So, total wall area is 2*(l + w)*h. But wait, since the semi-perimeter is (l + w) = s = (5/2)h, then the perimeter is 2*(l + w) = 2s = 2*(5/2)h) =5h. So, the area of the walls is 5h * h = 5h\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. The perimeter of the base is 2*(l + w), so the perimeter is 2s, where s is the semi-perimeter. So, the area of the four walls is perimeter * height = (2s)*h. But since s is (5/2)h, substituting that in gives 2*(5/2 h) *h \u2192 (5h) * h =5h\u00b2. That's correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the area for doors and windows is 15 sq.m. So, the area of the walls to be covered with paper is (5h\u00b2 - 15).\n\nNow, the cost is Rs.260. Let's see how the cost relates to the area. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost is Rs.2 per meter, but I think that's the cost per linear meter of the paper. So, the cost per square meter would be Rs.2 divided by the width of the paper. Wait, no, wait: when you buy paper, you pay per linear meter. So, each linear meter of paper covers a width of 0.5m. So, the area covered per linear meter is 0.5m * 1m = 0.5 sq.m. But wait, no, because the paper is 50cm wide, so 0.5m. So, each meter of the paper (length) would cover 0.5m * 1m = 0.5 sq.m.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of how much paper is needed. The area to cover is (5h\u00b2 -15) sq.m. The paper is 0.5m wide, so the area of the paper used is length * width. Let me denote the length of paper needed as L meters. Then, the area of paper is L * 0.5 = (5h\u00b2 -15).\n\nSo, L = (5h\u00b2 -15) / 0.5 = 2*(5h\u00b2 -15) = 10h\u00b2 -30 meters.\n\nThe cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. So, total cost is L * 2 = (10h\u00b2 -30)*2 = 20h\u00b2 -60. And this equals Rs.260.\n\nSo, 20h\u00b2 -60 = 260 \u2192 20h\u00b2 = 320 \u2192 h\u00b2 = 16 \u2192 h =4 meters.\n\nWait, that gives h=4, which is option C. But wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, another approach: The area of the walls is 2*(l + w)*h. Since l + w = (5/2)h, then 2*(5/2 h)*h =5h\u00b2. So, the total wall area is 5h\u00b2.\n\nBut the area to be covered is 5h\u00b2 -15. So, the area of paper needed is 5h\u00b2 -15.\n\nThe paper is 50cm wide, so 0.5m wide. The length of the paper required is (5h\u00b2 -15) / 0.5 = 10h\u00b2 -30 meters.\n\nCost per meter is Rs.2, so total cost is (10h\u00b2 -30) *2 = 20h\u00b2 -60 = 260.\n\nSo, 20h\u00b2 =320 \u2192 h\u00b2=16 \u2192 h=4m.\n\nSo the height is 4m, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't confuse anything. Another thing to check: did I correctly account for the doors and windows? Yes, I subtracted 15 sq.m from the total wall area. So that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, could the ratio be something else? Let me think: the ratio of height to semi-perimeter is 2:5, so h/(l +w) =2/5 \u2192 l +w= (5/2)h. That's correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer should be C)4m.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the height of a room given the ratio of height to semi-perimeter (2:5) and the cost of papering the walls. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Ratio**: The height-to-semi-perimeter ratio is given as 2:5. Let the height be \\( h \\) and the semi-perimeter be \\( s \\). Then, \\( \\frac{h}{s} = \\frac{2}{5} \\), which implies \\( s = \\frac{5}{2}h \\). Since the semi-perimeter \\( s \\) is \\( l + w \\) (where \\( l \\) and \\( w \\) are the length and width of the room), the perimeter of the base is \\( 2(l + w) = 2s = 5h \\).\n\n2. **Wall Area Calculation**: The total area of the four walls is given by the perimeter of the base multiplied by the height, i.e., \\( \\text{Wall Area} = \\text{Perimeter} \\times h = 5h \\times h = 5h^2 \\). However, the area of doors and windows (15 \\( \\text{sq.m} \\)) must be subtracted, so the area to be papered is \\( 5h^2 - 15 \\).\n\n3. **Cost and Paper Dimensions**: The paper is 50 cm wide (0.5 m) and costs Rs. 2 per meter. The length of paper required is determined by dividing the area to be papered by the width of the paper:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of Paper} = \\frac{\\text{Area to be Papered}}{\\text{Width of Paper}} = \\frac{5h^2 - 15}{0.5} = 10h^2 - 30 \\, \\text{m}.\n   \\]  \n   The total cost is then given by multiplying the length of paper by the cost per meter:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = (\\text{Length of Paper}) \\times 2 = (10h^2 - 30) \\times 2 = 20h^2 - 60.\n   \\]  \n   The problem states that the total cost is Rs. 260, so:  \n   \\[\n   20h^2 - 60 = 260 \\implies 20h^2 = 320 \\implies h^2 = 16 \\implies h = 4 \\, \\text{m}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification**: The calculations confirm that the height of the room is \\( 4 \\, \\text{m} \\), which matches option C.\n\n**Answer: C**",
