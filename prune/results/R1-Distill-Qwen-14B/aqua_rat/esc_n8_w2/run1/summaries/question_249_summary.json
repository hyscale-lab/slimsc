Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727 + 728 + 729.\n\nWait, wait. Hmm. So the product of three consecutive integers equals the sum of those three numbers: 727, 728, 729. Or wait, no, wait. Let me parse that again.\n\nOh no, actually, the way it's phrased is a bit tricky. It says the product of three consecutive integers can be expressed as 727 + 728 + 729. So the product equals the sum of those three numbers. Or is it the other way around? Let me think.\n\nWait, no. The wording is: \"the product can be expressed as 727+728+729.\" So that means the product is equal to 727 plus 728 plus 729. So first, I need to calculate what 727 + 728 + 729 is, then find three consecutive integers whose product is that sum, and then find their sum.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, no.

Let me clarify.\n\nThe question is asking for the sum of three consecutive integers. The product of these three integers is equal to 727+728+729. So first, calculate the sum of 727, 728, 729. Then, find three consecutive integers whose product is that sum. Then, add those three integers together to get the answer.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense. Because 727, 728, 729 are three consecutive integers themselves. Wait, no, their sum is 727 + 728 +729. Let me compute that.\n\nSo 727 + 728 is 1455, plus 729 is 2184. So the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184. Then, find three consecutive integers whose product is 2184, and then sum them.\n\nWait, but the question is a bit confusing. Let me make sure I understand it correctly. The product of the three consecutive integers is 2184, and we need to find the sum of those three integers. So find three consecutive integers, multiply them, and their product is 2184. Then, add those three numbers.\n\nSo the task is: find three consecutive integers a, a+1, a+2 such that a*(a+1)*(a+2) = 2184. Then, the sum is 3a +3, which is 3(a+1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum is 3a+3, but perhaps we can find a first.\n\nWait, but maybe I can think of the cube of a number as an approximation. Let me see, since 12^3 is 1728, 13^3 is 2197. Oh, wait, 13^3 is 2197, which is just a bit more than 2184. Hmm, so maybe the three consecutive integers are around 12, 13, 14.\n\nWait, let's compute 12 *13 *14. 12*13 is 156, 156 *14 is 2184. Oh, exactly! So the three integers are 12, 13, 14. So their sum is 12 +13 +14 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. The options are A)37, B)38, C)36, D)30, E)39. So option E is 39. That would be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because the product is 2184, which is 12*13*14. So the three numbers are 12,13,14. Sum is 39, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the sum of three consecutive integers whose product is 2184. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be E)39.\n",

The product of three consecutive integers is equal to the sum of 727, 728, and 729. So, product = 727 +728 +729. Then, find the sum of these three integers.\n\nWait, no.

So, the answer is E.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729.\" So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about negative integers? Because sometimes consecutive integers could be negative. Let me see: is there a possibility that n is negative?\n\nLet me see. Let's suppose n is a negative integer. Let's try n=-14. Then, n+1=-13, n+2=-12. Their product would be (-14)*(-13)*(-12)= (-14)*(156)= -2184. But we need the product to be 2184, so it's negative. So that's not possible.
