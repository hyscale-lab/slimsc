      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Sachin and Ajay's ages. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read the question again.\n\nThe question says, \"Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. How old is Ajay today if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years.\" The options are A)18, B)25, C)15, D)20, E)21.\n\nAlright, so I need to find Ajay's current age. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, let's think about Sachin's future age. The problem states that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years. That means right now, Sachin's age must be 40 minus 10. So 40 -10 is 30. So Sachin is 30 years old today.\n\nWait, wait, is that right? Let me make sure. If in 10 years he'll be 40, subtracting 10 gives his current age as 30. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the other part says that 10 years ago, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay. So I need to figure out their ages 10 years ago.\n\nLet me denote their current ages. Let me call Sachin's current age S and Ajay's current age A.\n\nFrom the first part, I know S = 30.\n\nNow, 10 years ago, Sachin's age would have been S - 10, and Ajay's age would have been A -10.\n\nAccording to the problem, 10 years ago, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay. So:\n\nS - 10 = 2 * (A -10)\n\nWe already know S is 30, so substituting that in:\n\n30 -10 = 2*(A -10)\n20 = 2*(A -10)\n\nDivide both sides by 2 to simplify:\n\n10 = A -10\n\nThen add 10 to both sides:\n\nA = 20\n\nSo Ajay is 20 years old today. Looking at the options, D is 20. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nSachin's current age is 30. In 10 years, he'll be 40. That part checks out.\n\n10 years ago, Sachin was 20. Ajay was half of that, which is 10. So Ajay's age 10 years ago was 10, making his current age 20. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D)20.\n",

Let me try to break it down.\n\nThe problem says: Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. How old is Ajay today if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years?\n\nHmm, I think I'll need to set up some equations based on the information given. Let's see. \n\nFirst, let me assign variables to the current ages. Let's say S is Sachin's current age, and A is Ajay's current age. \n\nThe first part says that 10 years ago, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay. So, 10 years ago, Sachin's age would have been S - 10, and Ajay's age would have been A - 10. The relationship between them then was S -10 = 2*(A -10). That's equation one.\n\nThe second part says that Sachin will be 40 in 10 years. So, in 10 years, Sachin's age will be S + 10, which equals 40. So S +10 =40. That's equation two. \n\nWait, equation two seems straightforward. If S +10=40, then S=30. So Sachin is currently 30 years old. \n\nNow, knowing that S is 30, I can plug that into equation one to find A. \n\nSo equation one: 30 -10 = 2*(A -10). Let's compute the left side: 30-10 is 20. So 20 = 2*(A-10). Dividing both sides by 2 gives 10 = A -10. Adding 10 to both sides, A=20. \n\nSo Ajay is 20 years old today. Looking at the options, D is 20. \n\nWait a second, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nIf Sachin is 30 now, then 10 years ago he was 20. Ajay was then 10 years younger, so Ajay was 10 years old 10 years ago. That makes Ajay now 20. Yes, that makes sense. Also, in 10 years, Sachin will be 40, which matches the problem statement. \n\nSo the answer should be D)20.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nLet the current age of Sachin be \\( S \\) and the current age of Ajay be \\( A \\).\n\n1.
