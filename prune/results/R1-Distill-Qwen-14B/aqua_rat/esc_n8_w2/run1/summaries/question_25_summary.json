      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Bill riding his bicycle on a windy day. Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out how far he can travel in 21 minutes when the wind is slowing him down. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that Bill's usual average speed is 15 mph on a normal day. But on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. Oh right, so I subtract 4 from 15. Let me calculate that: 15 minus 4 is 11. So his speed on a windy day is 11 mph.\n\nWait, but the time given is in minutes. 21 minutes. I think I need to convert that to hours because speed is in miles per hour. How do I do that? Well, there are 60 minutes in an hour. So 21 minutes is 21/60 hours. Let me compute that. 21 divided by 60 equals... let's see, 21 divided by 60 is 0.35 hours. Because 60 times 0.35 is 21. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, to find the distance he travels, I remember the formula: distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, I'll multiply his speed on the windy day by the time in hours. That would be 11 mph multiplied by 0.35 hours. Let me do that math. 11 times 0.35. Hmm, 10 times 0.35 is 3.5, and 1 times 0.35 is 0.35. Adding them together, 3.5 plus 0.35 is 3.85. So the distance is 3.85 miles.\n\nWait, but the options given are A)2, B)2.25, C)3.25, D)3.85, E)2.85. Oh, I see option D is 3.85. So that's the answer. But wait, the question says to round to the nearest hundredth. Did I do that correctly?\n\nLet me double-check. 11 * 0.35. Let me compute that again. 11 * 0.3 is 3.3, and 11 * 0.05 is 0.55. Adding those gives 3.3 + 0.55 = 3.85. Yep, that's exactly 3.85, so no rounding needed. So the correct answer is D.\n",

They're asking how far he can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes. The options are A to E, and I need to pick the right one. \n\nHmm, right, so first, I think I should find out what Bill's speed is on a windy day. His normal speed is 15 mph, and it's reduced by 4 mph. So that's 15 minus 4. Let me calculate that: 15 -4 equals 11 mph. So on a windy day, he goes 11 mph.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a second. The question is about how far he can go in 21 minutes. Oh, right, because speed is in miles per hour, but the time is given in minutes. So I need to convert that time into hours to match the units. \n\n21 minutes is less than an hour. How do I convert minutes to hours? Well, since there are 60 minutes in an hour, I can divide 21 by 60. Let me do that. 21 divided by 60 is... let's see, 21/60 is the same as 0.35 hours. Oh, right, because 21 divided by 60 is 0.35. \n\nSo now I have his speed and the time in hours. The formula for distance is speed multiplied by time. So distance equals speed times time. \n\nSo plugging in the numbers, that would be 11 mph multiplied by 0.35 hours. Let me calculate that. 11 times 0.35.

So no rounding needed here. \n\nLet me double-check my steps. Speed on a windy day is 15-4=11 mph. Time is 21 minutes, which is 21/60=0.35 hours. Distance is 11 * 0.35 = 3.85 miles.
