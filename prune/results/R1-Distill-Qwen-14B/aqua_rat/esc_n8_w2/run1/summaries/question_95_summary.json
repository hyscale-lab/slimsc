      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. \n\nThe problem is about a hotel ordering newspapers. The cost varies depending on the day. On Sundays, each newspaper costs $4, and the rest of the days it's $1 each. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday compared to the other days. The total they pay per week is $210. The question is asking how many newspapers they buy on Monday. The options are A)15, B)30, C)45, D)60, E)75.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. I think I should probably use algebra to solve this. Let me assign some variables to make it easier.\n\nLet's say that the number of newspapers bought on a non-Sunday day (like Monday) is 'x'. So, on each of the other six days (Monday to Saturday), they buy 'x' newspapers. But wait, wait, wait\u2014no, wait. Wait, the problem says the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as on the other days. So, if I'm considering the other days as 'x' each, then Sunday would be 2x. But wait, how many days are we considering here?\n\nWait, the rest of the week is Monday to Saturday, which is six days. Or wait, the problem says \"the rest of the days of the week\" which is six days. So for each of those six days, the hotel buys 'x' newspapers. And on Sunday, they buy twice that, so 2x.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: wait, no. Let me read the problem again. It says the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week. So, is it that on Sunday, they order twice as many as the total of the other days combined, or twice as many as each other day?\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. Because if \"the rest of the days\" is plural, like each day, then on Sunday, they buy twice as many as each day. But if \"the rest of the days\" is the total, then Sunday is twice the total of the other days.\n\nHmm. Let me re-read the problem statement: \"a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Oh, so \"the rest of the days\" refers to all the other days collectively. So the total on Sunday is twice the sum of all the other days.\n\nWait, no, that's not necessarily the case. Let me think. If the hotel buys 'x' papers each on the other days, then the total for the other days is 6x (since there are six days: Monday to Saturday). Then Sunday would be 2 times that, so 2*(6x) = 12x. Wait, but that would make Sunday's order 12x. Alternatively, maybe it's that on Sunday, they buy twice as many as on a single other day. So if each other day is 'x', Sunday is 2x. But that would be the case if \"the rest of the days\" is referring to each day individually.\n\nWait, this is a point of confusion. Let me parse the sentence again: \"the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Hmm. The way it's phrased, \"the rest of the days of the week\" could be interpreted as the total of the other days. So, the total for Sunday is twice the total of the other six days.\n\nWait, let's think about both scenarios.\n\nScenario 1: Each day (Mon-Sat) is 'x', so total for those six days is 6x. Sunday is twice that, so 2*6x =12x. So total newspapers per week would be 6x +12x=18x. Then, the cost would be calculated as (12x * $4) + (6x * $1) = 48x +6x=54x. And the total is $210, so 54x = 210. Let me compute x: x=210/54. Let me compute that. 54 * 3 = 162, 54*3.888... \u2248210. 210/54=3.5185. Hmm, but x would then be a fractional number of newspapers, which doesn't make sense. So that can't be right.\n\nScenario 2: On Sunday, the hotel buys twice as many as on a single other day. So, each other day is 'x', Sunday is 2x. So the total newspapers per week are 6x + 2x=8x. The cost would be (2x *4) + (6x *1) = 8x +6x=14x. Then, 14x=210 \u2192 x=210/14=15. So x=15. That would mean that on each of the other days (Mon-Sat), they buy 15 newspapers, and on Sunday, 30 (2*15). So the answer would be 15, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem is asking how many they buy on Monday. So in this case, each day Mon-Sat is 15, so Monday is 15. So the answer would be option A.\n\nBut let me make sure I interpreted the problem correctly. The problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" So if the rest of the days are considered as each day, then Sunday is twice per day. Alternatively, if the rest of the days are considered as a group, then Sunday is twice the total of the rest.\n\nBut the way the sentence is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me think about the grammar. \"Twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days.\" The structure is \"as many as it does the rest of the days.\" So does \"the rest of the days\" mean each day, or the sum of all the other days?\n\nHmm. Another way to think: if it's \"twice as many as each of the rest of the days\", then Sunday is 2x, others x. But if it's \"twice as many as the total of the rest of the days\", then Sunday is 2*(sum of others). \n\nIn English, \"twice as many as\" can sometimes be ambiguous. But in this context, perhaps it's intended that Sunday's order is twice each other day's order. Because otherwise, the total for Sunday would be way too high, leading to a fractional x.\n\nWait, in the first scenario, I got x=3.5185, which is not possible, so that can't be right. So the second scenario must be correct. So the answer is 15, which is option A.\n\nSo, in that case, the number of newspapers bought on Monday is 15. So the answer is A.\n",

So I need to calculate the total cost for each day and sum them up to equal $210.\n\nSo, for the other days (Monday to Saturday, that's 6 days), each day they buy x newspapers at $1 each. So each of those days costs x * $1. But wait, no, wait a second. Because the cost is $1 per paper each day, but if they buy x papers each day, then for each day, the cost is x * 1.
