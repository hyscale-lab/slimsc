      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take both a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation?\n\nThe options are A)5%, B)15%, C)25%, D)35%, E)45%.\n\nHmm, I think I can solve this using a Venn diagram approach or maybe some set theory formulas. Let me think about the data given.\n\nFirst, let's break down the percentages:\n\n- 75% take a winter vacation. So, the winter vacation set (let's call it W) has 75%.\n- 40% take both winter and summer vacations. So, the intersection of W and S (summer) is 40%.\n- 20% take neither. That means the remaining employees take at least one of the vacations.\n\nWait, to find how many take at least one vacation, I can subtract those who take neither from 100%. So 100% - 20% = 80% take either winter, summer, or both.\n\nSo, the total in the union of W and S is 80%.\n\nI remember that the formula for the union of two sets is P(W \u222a S) = P(W) + P(S) - P(W \u2229 S).\n\nWe can plug in the values we have:\n\n80% = 75% + P(S) - 40%.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n80 = 75 + P(S) - 40\nSimplify the right side: 75-40 is 35, so 35 + P(S) = 80.\n\nSubtract 35 from both sides: P(S) = 80 -35 = 45%.\n\nWait, so 45% take the summer vacation. But the question is asking for those who take summer but not winter. That's the part of the summer circle that doesn't overlap with winter.\n\nSince 40% take both, the summer only would be total summer minus both. So 45% (summer) -40% (both) =5%?\n\nWait, that can't be right because 5% is one of the options, but let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the union. Let me go through it again.\n\nP(W \u222a S) = P(W) + P(S) - P(W \u2229 S)\n\nWe know that P(W \u222a S) is 80% because 20% take neither.\n\nSo, 80 = 75 + P(S) -40.\n\n75-40 is 35, so 35 + P(S) =80.\n\nP(S) = 80 -35 =45. So P(S)=45%.\n\nSo 45% take summer. But some of them take both. So the number that take only summer is 45% -40% =5%.\n\nSo the answer would be 5%? But looking at the options, option A is 5%. Hmm, but I thought 45% was the summer, so the summer only is 5%? That seems low.\n\nWait, let me think another way. Maybe using a Venn diagram.\n\nImagine a circle for winter (75%) and a circle for summer (unknown). The overlap is 40%, so the part of winter circle that doesn't overlap is 75-40=35%. The part of summer that doesn't overlap is what we're looking for.\n\nThe total taking at least one vacation is 80%. So 35% (only winter) + S_only + 40% (both) =80%.\n\nSo, 35 + S_only +40=80.\n\nAdding 35+40=75. So 75 + S_only=80 \u2192 S_only=5%.\n\nOh wait, so that's 5% take only summer. So the answer is 5%, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, why is 45% the total summer, and only 5% take only summer? Because 40% take both. So 40+5=45. That makes sense.\n\nSo the answer should be 5%, which is option A. But wait, the options are A to E, with E being 45. So if the question is about summer only, it's 5%, so A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try using a formula for the summer only.\n\nThe number of people taking only summer is P(S) - P(W \u2229 S).\n\nWe found P(S) is 45%, so 45-40=5%.\n\nYes, so that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is A)5%.\n",

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, let's break down the given information. The problem says:\n\n- 75% take a winter vacation. So that's the winter vacationers.\n- 40% take both winter and summer vacations. Oh, that's the overlap between winter and summer.\n- 20% take neither. So, they don't go on either vacation.\n\nI remember from set theory that the total percentage of people who take at least one vacation should be 100% minus those who take neither. Let's calculate that. 100% minus 20% is 80%. So, 80% of employees take at least one vacation, either winter, summer, or both.\n\nNow, I think I can use a Venn diagram approach here. There are two circles: one for winter and one for summer. The overlapping part is the 40% who take both.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- W as the winter vacation group. So, W = 75%.\n- S as the summer vacation group. We don't know this yet; that's what we're trying to find.\n- Both W and S is 40%.\n- Neither is 20%.\n\nThe formula for the union of two sets is: |W \u222a S| = |W| + |S| - |W \u2229 S|. We know that |W \u222a S| is 80% (since 20% take neither), |W| is 75%, and |W \u2229 S| is 40%. So we can plug these into the formula.\n\nSo, 80 = 75 + S - 40. Let's compute that. 75 minus 40 is 35. So 80 = 35 + S. Subtracting 35 from both sides gives S = 45%.\n\nWait, so S is 45%? That's the total percentage of employees taking summer vacation, including those who also take winter. But the question asks for those who take summer but not winter.\n\nSo, if 45% take summer, and 40% take both, then the number taking only summer is 45% minus 40%, which is 5%. Oh wait, that can't be right because 5% seems low. Let me check my math again.\n\nWait, wait. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's go through it again.\n\nThe union is 80%, which equals W + S - both. So 80 = 75 + S - 40. Let's compute 75 - 40: that's 35. So 80 = 35 + S. So S = 80 - 35 = 45%. So that part is correct.\n\nSo S is 45%, which includes both those who take only summer and those who take both. So the ones taking only summer are S minus both, which is 45% - 40% = 5%. So 5% take summer but not winter.\n\nWait, but that's one of the options. Option A is 5%. Hmm, but that seems low. Let me think again. Is there another approach?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a table would help. Let's make a 2x2 grid. The categories are Winter Vacation (Yes/No) and Summer Vacation (Yes/No).\n\nSo the four categories are:\n\n1. Winter Yes, Summer Yes: 40%\n2. Winter Yes, Summer No: ?\n3. Winter No, Summer Yes: ?\n4. Winter No, Summer No: 20%\n\nWe know that the total for Winter Yes is 75%. So, 40% are in both, so the remaining in Winter Yes is 75% -40% = 35% (that's the Winter Yes, Summer No category).\n\nThe total of all categories should be 100%. So the sum of all four is 100.\n\nWe have:\n\n40% (both) + 35% (only winter) + (summer only) + 20% (neither) = 100.\n\nSo adding the knowns: 40 +35 +20 =95. So the remaining is 5% for summer only. So that's 5%.\n\nSo the answer is 5%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but 5% seems really low. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nTotal taking at least one vacation:80% (as 20% take neither). So 80% includes both winter and summer.\n\nWe have 75% winter. So, 75% winter includes those who take both and those who take only winter. So 75% = 40% both + 35% only winter.\n\nThen, summer vacationers are those who take both plus those who take only summer. Let me denote S as total summer: S = both + only summer.\n\nFrom the union, 80% = W + S - both. 80 =75 + S -40. So 80 =35 + S \u2192 S=45. So S is 45, which is both (40) plus only summer (5).

Winter Yes, Summer Yes: 40%\n     2. Winter Yes, Summer No: \\( 75\\% - 40\\% = 35\\% \\)\n     3. Winter No, Summer Yes: \\( 45\\% - 40\\% = 5\\% \\)\n     4. Winter No, Summer No: 20%\n   - Summing these gives \\( 40\\% + 35\\% + 5\\% + 20\\% = 100\\% \\), confirming the calculations are correct.\n\nThus, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is **5%**, corresponding to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
