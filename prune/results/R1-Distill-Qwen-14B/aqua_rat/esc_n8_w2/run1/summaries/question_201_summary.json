      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the rate of interest. The question says that the difference between simple interest and compound interest for Rs.5000 over 2 years is Rs.72. The options are A to E, with various percentages.\n\nHmm, I remember that simple interest is calculated as principal times rate times time, right? So SI = P * R * T. And compound interest, especially for 2 years, is a bit different. CI would be principal times (1 + rate)^time minus the principal. Oh wait, but since it's for 2 years, I can write it as P*(1+R/100)^2 - P. \n\nWait, the difference between CI and SI is given as 72. So the formula for the difference would be CI - SI = 72. Let me write that out.\n\nSo, SI = 5000 * R * 2. Because P is 5000, T is 2. So SI = 10000 R. But wait, R is in percentage, so I need to convert it to decimal. Oh right, so R is like R/100.\n\nWait no, in the formula, R is in percentage, so SI is (5000 * R * 2)/100. Oh right, because SI = (P*R*T)/100. So that would be (5000 * R * 2)/100. Simplifying that: (10000 R)/100 = 100 R.\n\nFor CI, the formula is P*( (1 + R/100)^T - 1 ). So for 2 years, it's 5000 * ( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ). Let me expand that. (1 + R/100)^2 is 1 + 2(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So subtracting 1 gives 2(R/100) + (R/100)^2. Multiply by 5000: 5000 * [ 2(R/100) + (R^2)/(10000) ].\n\nHmm, so CI is 5000*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(10000)). Let me calculate that. 5000 * 2R/100 is 5000 * 0.02 R = 100 R. And 5000 * R\u00b2/(10000) is (5000 * R\u00b2)/10000 = (5000/10000)*R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSo CI is 100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2. And SI is 100 R. The difference between CI and SI is (100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2) - 100 R = 0.5 R\u00b2. And that's equal to 72.\n\nSo 0.5 R\u00b2 =72. Multiply both sides by 2: R\u00b2 =144. Take square root: R=12%. Oh, because rate can't be negative.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12%. So that's the answer.\n",
