      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about oarsmen's weights. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the average weight of 10 oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg when one person is replaced. The replaced person weighed 53 kg, and I need to find the new man's weight.\n\nWait, average weight is total weight divided by the number of people. So, when one person leaves and another comes in, the total weight changes, which affects the average.\n\nRight, the number of oarsmen remains the same, 10. Because only one was replaced. So, the initial average is (total initial weight)/10. After replacement, the average is (total initial -53 + new weight)/10.\n\nAnd the average increased by 1.8 kg. So the new average is old average + 1.8.\n\nLet me write that down. Let's denote the initial total weight as T. So, initial average = T/10.\n\nAfter replacement, the total weight becomes T - 53 + x, where x is the new man's weight. The new average is (T -53 +x)/10.\n\nThe new average is 1.8 kg more than the old average. So,\n\n(T -53 + x)/10 = (T/10) + 1.8.\n\nHmm, let's multiply both sides by 10 to get rid of the denominator.\n\nT -53 + x = T + 18.\n\nWait, because 10*(T/10) is T, and 10*1.8 is 18.\n\nSo, T -53 +x = T +18.\n\nNow, let me subtract T from both sides. T cancels out.\n\n-53 + x = 18.\n\nSo, x = 18 +53 =71 kg.\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Option A is 71. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, let me check again. Because when the average increases by 1.8 for all 10, the total increase is 10 *1.8 =18 kg. So, the new person must be heavier by that amount plus the weight of the person they replaced.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the total weight after replacement is initial total -53 + x. The change in total is (x -53). So the increase in total is (x-53). This increase leads to an increase in average of 1.8 kg. So the total increase is 10 *1.8=18 kg.\n\nSo, x-53=18 => x=71 kg. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the new man's weight is 71 kg. So the correct answer is option A.\n",
