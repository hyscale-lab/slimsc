      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where Ram and Krishna are starting from points A and B, respectively. They're moving towards each other on the same route. Ram's speed is 20 m/s, and Krishna's is 40 m/s. They meet at point C after 10 seconds. I need to find the total distance between A and B.\n\nHmm, right, so when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So Ram is going at 20 m/s, Krishna at 40 m/s. So combined, they're approaching each other at 20 + 40 = 60 m/s. \n\nWait, yeah, because if Ram is moving towards B and Krishna towards A, their speeds add up when calculating the time until they meet. \n\nThey meet after 10 seconds. So the distance covered by both of them together in those 10 seconds should be equal to the total distance between A and B.\n\nSo the formula would be: total distance = (sum of their speeds) \u00d7 time taken.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: sum is 60 m/s, time is 10 s. So 60 * 10 = 600 meters. So the total distance from A to B is 600 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 600 meters. So the answer should be E.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. \n\nRam and Krishna are starting from points A and B respectively, at the same time. They're moving towards each other on the same route. Ram's speed is 20 m/s and Krishna's is 40 m/s. They meet at point C after 10 seconds. The question is asking for the total distance between A and B.\n\nHmm, right. So, when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Oh wait, that's correct because they're approaching each other, so their speeds add up.\n\nLet me think. So, the combined speed would be 20 + 40, which is 60 m/s. Right. Because if Ram is moving at 20 and Krishna at 40 towards each other, every second, the distance between them decreases by 60 meters.\n\nThey meet after 10 seconds. So the total distance between A and B must be the distance they've covered in those 10 seconds together. So the formula would be distance = speed \u00d7 time.\n\nCalculating that: 60 m/s * 10 s = 600 meters. So the total distance is 600 meters. Looking at the options, option E is 600 meters. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, Ram's distance is 20 *10 =200 meters from A. Krishna's distance is 40 *10=400 meters from B.
