      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe problem says: The sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we'll get a number with the same digits in reverse order. We have to find the original number from the options given.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, it's a three-digit number, so let's represent it as ABC, where A, B, C are its digits. So the number itself is 100*A + 10*B + C.\n\nThe first condition is that the sum of the digits is 17. So A + B + C = 17.\n\nThe second condition is that the sum of the squares of the digits is 109. So A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 = 109.\n\nThird, when we subtract 495 from the number, we get the reverse, which would be CBA. So:\n\n100*A + 10*B + C - 495 = 100*C + 10*B + A.\n\nHmm, let me write that equation down:\n\n100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A.\n\nLet me simplify this equation. Subtract the right side from both sides to bring all terms to the left.\n\n100A + 10B + C - 495 - (100C + 10B + A) = 0.\n\nExpanding that, I get:\n\n100A - A + 10B - 10B + C - 100C - 495 = 0.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n99A - 99C - 495 = 0.\n\nWait, so 99A - 99C = 495. I can factor out 99:\n\n99(A - C) = 495.\n\nDivide both sides by 99:\n\nA - C = 5.\n\nSo the difference between the hundreds digit and the units digit is 5. So A = C + 5.\n\nThat's a helpful relationship. Now, let's see what else we have.\n\nWe have two equations from the digit sums:\n\n1. A + B + C = 17\n2. A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 = 109.\n\nBut since A = C +5, I can substitute that into the first two equations.\n\nLet's substitute into equation 1:\n\n(C +5) + B + C =17.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2C + B +5 =17.\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n\n2C + B =12.\n\nSo equation 1 becomes B =12 - 2C.\n\nNow, substitute A = C+5 and B=12-2C into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2: (C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C^2 = 109.\n\nLet me expand each term.\n\nFirst term: (C+5)^2 = C\u00b2 + 10C +25.\n\nSecond term: (12-2C)^2 = (12)^2 - 2*12*2C + (2C)^2 = 144 -48C +4C\u00b2.\n\nThird term is C\u00b2.\n\nNow sum all terms:\n\n(C\u00b2 +10C +25) + (144 -48C +4C\u00b2) + C\u00b2 =109.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nC\u00b2 +4C\u00b2 +C\u00b2 = 6C\u00b2.\n\n10C -48C = -38C.\n\n25 +144 = 169.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +169 =109.\n\nSubtract 109 from both sides:\n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +60=0.\n\nSimplify this equation. Let's see if I can divide through by 2.\n\n3C\u00b2 -19C +30=0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for C.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula: C = [19 \u00b1 sqrt( (19)^2 -4*3*30 ) ]/(2*3).\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n19^2 = 361.\n\n4*3*30=360.\n\nSo discriminant is 361-360=1.\n\nSo sqrt(1)=1.\n\nSo C = [19 \u00b11]/6.\n\nSo two possibilities:\n\nC = (19+1)/6 =20/6=10/3 \u22483.333.\n\nOr C=(19-1)/6=18/6=3.\n\nWait, but C is a digit, so it must be an integer between 0 and9. So 10/3 is not an integer, so only C=3 is acceptable.\n\nSo C=3.\n\nNow, let's find A and B.\n\nA = C +5 =3+5=8.\n\nB=12-2C=12-6=6.\n\nSo the number is ABC = 8 6 3 \u2192 863.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check if this number satisfies all the conditions.\n\nFirst, the sum of digits: 8+6+3=17. Yes.\n\nSum of squares: 8\u00b2 +6\u00b2 +3\u00b2=64 +36 +9=109. Correct.\n\nNow, subtract 495: 863 -495=368. Is 368 the reverse of 863? Let's see: 863 reversed is 368. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 368. But wait, the question says that subtracting 495 gives the reversed number. So if the original is 863, then subtracting 495 gives 368, which is the reversed number. So the original number is 863. But 863 isn't one of the options. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, the options given are A)368, B)377, C)288, D)997, E)112.\n\nWait, so 863 isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, when I subtracted 495, I got 368. So 863 is the original number, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in my steps.\n\nLet me go back.\n\nWait, when I set up the equation, I assumed that the number ABC minus 495 is CBA.\n\nSo, ABC -495 = CBA.\n\nSo, 100A +10B +C -495 = 100C +10B +A.\n\nLet me rearrange that equation again.\n\n100A +10B +C -495 = 100C +10B +A.\n\nSubtract (100C +10B +A) from both sides:\n\n100A -A +10B -10B +C -100C -495 =0.\n\nWhich gives 99A -99C -495=0.\n\nDivide by 99: A - C =5. So that's correct.\n\nSo, A = C +5.\n\nThen, the sum of digits: A + B + C=17.\n\nSubstituting A: (C+5) + B + C=17 \u2192 2C + B +5=17 \u2192 2C + B=12 \u2192 B=12-2C.\n\nThen sum of squares: (C+5)^2 + B^2 + C^2=109.\n\nSubstituting B=12-2C:\n\n(C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C^2 =109.\n\nExpanding each term:\n\n(C^2 +10C +25) + (144 -48C +4C^2) + C^2.\n\nAdding them up: 6C^2 -38C + 169 =109.\n\nWait, 6C\u00b2 -38C +169=109 \u2192 6C\u00b2 -38C +60=0 \u2192 3C\u00b2 -19C +30=0.\n\nSolving, discriminant= 361-360=1.\n\nSo, C=(19\u00b11)/6 \u2192 20/6=3.333 (invalid) or 18/6=3.\n\nSo C=3. So A=8, B=6.\n\nSo the number is 863, which isn't in the options. Hmm.\n\nWait, the options don't have 863. So either I made a mistake, or perhaps I misread the question.\n\nWait, the problem says that when you subtract 495, you get the reversed number. So perhaps the original number is the reversed of the result.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the equation wrong. Let me think again.\n\nIf the original number is ABC, and when you subtract 495, you get CBA.\n\nSo ABC -495 = CBA.\n\nSo ABC = CBA +495.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as ABC = CBA +495. Maybe I should represent the equation differently.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought ABC -495 = CBA, which is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made an error in the equation setup. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, let me re-express the equation:\n\n100A +10B + C -495 = 100C +10B + A.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the sum of the squares. Let me check that.\n\nA=8, B=6, C=3.\n\nSum of squares: 64 +36 +9=109. Correct.\n\nSum of digits:17. Correct.\n\nSo, the number is 863, but it's not in the options. So perhaps I should check the options to see if any of them satisfy the conditions.\n\nLet me go through each option.\n\nOption A) 368.\n\nSum of digits: 3+6+8=17. Correct.\n\nSum of squares:9 +36 +64=109. Correct.\n\nSubtract 495: 368 -495 = -127. Hmm, negative number, which can't be a three-digit number. So this doesn't fit the third condition. Because 368 is less than 495, subtracting would give a negative, which can't be the reverse. So option A is invalid.\n\nOption B)377.\n\nSum of digits:3+7+7=17. Correct.\n\nSum of squares:9 +49 +49=107. Wait, 9+49 is 58, plus 49 is 107. But the required sum is 109. So this doesn't fit. So option B is out.\n\nOption C)288.\n\nDigits sum:2+8+8=18. Not 17. So no.\n\nOption D)997.\n\nSum:9+9+7=25. Not 17.\n\nOption E)112.\n\nSum:1+1+2=4. No.\n\nHmm, none of the options except A)368 satisfy the first two conditions. But when we subtract 495 from 368, we get a negative number, which can't be the reverse.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check the third condition again. Maybe the equation should be reversed. Like, perhaps the number is ABC, and when you subtract ABC, you get 495, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reversed number is ABC minus 495.\n\nWait, the original problem says: subtract 495 from the number, you get the reversed number.\n\nSo ABC -495 = CBA.\n\nWhich is correct as I set up earlier.\n\nBut since 368 is in the options and satisfies the first two conditions, but not the third, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if the equation could be set up differently. Maybe the number is CBA, and ABC is CBA +495. Let me think.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says subtract 495 from the number (ABC) to get the reversed (CBA). So ABC -495 = CBA.\n\nSo if I take option A)368 as the number, then 368-495= -127, which is not a three-digit number, so that can't be the case.\n\nHmm. So perhaps I made an error in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the number is such that when you subtract 495, you get the reversed number. So ABC -495 = CBA.\n\nSo, 100A +10B + C -495 = 100C +10B +A.\n\nWhich gives 99A -99C =495 \u2192 A - C=5.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nBut according to my calculations, the only possible C is 3, leading to A=8, B=6, number 863. But that's not in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares.\n\nWait, with A=8, B=6, C=3.\n\nSum of squares: 8^2=64, 6^2=36, 3^2=9. 64+36=100, +9=109. Correct.\n\nSum of digits:8+6+3=17. Correct.\n\nSo the number is 863, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation should be ABC +495 = CBA. Let me think. If I add 495 to the reversed number, do I get ABC?\n\nBut the problem says subtract 495, not add. So that might not be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the number as being larger than 495. Because if the reversed number is a three-digit number, then ABC must be larger than 495.\n\nWait, but in my solution, 863-495=368, which is a three-digit number. So that's correct.\n\nBut the options don't include 863. So perhaps I should check if any of the options satisfy the conditions.\n\nWait, let's check option A)368.\n\nSum of digits:3+6+8=17. Correct.\n\nSum of squares:9+36+64=109. Correct.\n\nNow, subtract 495: 368-495= -127. Which is a negative number, so it can't be a three-digit reversed number. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but according to the options, the only one that meets the first two conditions is A)368. But it doesn't meet the third condition.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation should be ABC - CBA = 495. Let me try that.\n\nSo, (100A +10B +C) - (100C +10B +A) =495.\n\nWhich gives 99A -99C =495 \u2192 A -C=5. Same as before.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nSo, same as before, A=C+5.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check if any of the options, when subtracted from 495, give their reverses.\n\nWait, the problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reversed number. So, ABC -495 = CBA.\n\nSo, let's check each option:\n\nOption A)368.\n\n368 -495= -127 \u2192 Not a three-digit number. So no.\n\nOption B)377.\n\n377-495= -118 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C)288-495= -207 \u2192 No.\n\nOption D)997-495=502. Reverse of 997 is 799. 502 is not 799. So no.\n\nOption E)112-495= -383 \u2192 No.\n\nSo none of the options satisfy ABC -495 = CBA except perhaps none.\n\nWait, but earlier, the correct number is 863, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the sum of squares equation.\n\nWait, let me substitute A= C+5 and B=12-2C into the sum of squares.\n\n(C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C^2 = 109.\n\nLet me compute each term again:\n\n(C+5)^2 = C\u00b2 +10C +25.\n\n(12-2C)^2 = (12)^2 - 2*(12)*(2C) + (2C)^2 \u2192 144 -48C +4C\u00b2.\n\nC^2 is just C\u00b2.\n\nAdding all three:\n\nC\u00b2 +10C +25 +144 -48C +4C\u00b2 +C\u00b2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nC\u00b2 +4C\u00b2 +C\u00b2 =6C\u00b2.\n\n10C -48C= -38C.\n\n25+144=169.\n\nSo equation:6C\u00b2 -38C +169 =109.\n\nSubtract 109:6C\u00b2-38C+60=0.\n\nDivide by 2:3C\u00b2-19C+30=0.\n\nDiscriminant:19\u00b2-4*3*30=361-360=1.\n\nSolutions: [19\u00b11]/6 \u2192 C=20/6=3.333 (invalid), or C=18/6=3.\n\nSo, C=3, A=8, B=6. So number is 863.\n\nBut again, it's not in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any of the options, when you subtract 495, give the reverse. So, for each option, compute option -495 and see if it's the reverse.\n\nOption A)368.\n\n368-495= -127 \u2192 no.\n\nOption B)377-495= -118 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C)288-495= -207 \u2192 no.\n\nOption D)997-495=502. Reverse of 997 is 799. 502\u2260799. No.\n\nOption E)112-495= -383 \u2192 no.\n\nSo none of the options satisfy the third condition.\n\nWait, but in the options, option A)368 satisfies the first two conditions, but not the third. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but the intended answer is A)368.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the third condition as ABC - CBA =495.\n\nSo, 100A +10B +C - (100C +10B +A) =495.\n\nWhich gives 99A -99C=495 \u2192 A -C=5. Same as before.\n\nSo, same as before. So perhaps the problem is that the correct answer isn't in the options, but perhaps I should choose the option that meets the first two conditions, which is A)368.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the number to be 368, and when you subtract 495, you get 368-495= -127. But that's not a valid three-digit number. So perhaps there's a mistake in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any other options could satisfy the first two conditions.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption B)377.\n\nSum of digits:3+7+7=17. Correct.\n\nSum of squares:9 +49 +49=107. Not 109. So no.\n\nOption D)997.\n\nSum:9+9+7=25. Not 17.\n\nOption E)112.\n\nSum:1+1+2=4. No.\n\nOption C)288.\n\nSum:2+8+8=18. No.\n\nSo only option A)368 meets the sum conditions.\n\nBut it doesn't meet the third condition. So perhaps the problem is expecting the answer A)368, despite the third condition not being met, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.\n\nWait, let me think: perhaps the equation is ABC - CBA =495.\n\nSo, 100A +10B +C - (100C +10B +A) =495.\n\nWhich gives 99A -99C=495 \u2192 A - C=5. Same as before.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nSo, the correct number is 863, which is not in the options. So perhaps the intended answer is option A)368, which meets the first two conditions but not the third. But that would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic equation.\n\nWait, when I substituted A and B in terms of C, I got to the quadratic equation 3C\u00b2 -19C +30=0.\n\nWait, let me check the substitution again.\n\nSum of squares equation:\n\n(C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C^2 =109.\n\nExpanding:\n\nC\u00b2 +10C +25 + (144-48C +4C\u00b2) +C\u00b2 =109.\n\nAdding like terms:\n\nC\u00b2 +4C\u00b2 +C\u00b2 =6C\u00b2.\n\n10C -48C= -38C.\n\n25+144=169.\n\nSo 6C\u00b2 -38C +169=109.\n\nSubtract 109:6C\u00b2-38C+60=0.\n\nDivide by 2:3C\u00b2-19C+30=0.\n\nDiscriminant: (19)^2 -4*3*30=361-360=1.\n\nSo roots (19\u00b11)/6 \u2192 20/6=3.333 and 18/6=3.\n\nOnly C=3 is valid.\n\nSo, no mistake there.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. The correct number is 863, which isn't in the options. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the number is the reverse of 368, which is 863, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a number in the options that when subtracted by 495 gives a reversed number. Let's check each option.\n\nOption A)368: 368-495=-127 \u2192 Not possible.\n\nOption B)377-495=-118 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C)288-495=-207 \u2192 No.\n\nOption D)997-495=502. Reverse of 997 is 799. 502\u2260799.\n\nOption E)112-495=-383 \u2192 No.\n\nSo none of the options meet the third condition. So perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options. But since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is option A)368, even though it doesn't satisfy all conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is ABC +495 = CBA. Let me try that.\n\nSo, 100A +10B +C +495=100C +10B +A.\n\nRearranged: 100A -A +10B -10B +C -100C +495=0.\n\nSo, 99A -99C +495=0 \u2192 99(A - C) =-495 \u2192 A - C= -5 \u2192 C = A +5.\n\nWait, that's a different equation. So, C = A +5.\n\nSo, A + B + C =17 \u2192 A + B + (A+5)=17 \u2192 2A + B +5=17 \u2192 2A + B=12 \u2192 B=12-2A.\n\nSum of squares: A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109.\n\nSubstituting C=A+5 and B=12-2A.\n\nSo,\n\nA\u00b2 + (12-2A)^2 + (A+5)^2 =109.\n\nExpand each term:\n\nA\u00b2 + (144 -48A +4A\u00b2) + (A\u00b2 +10A +25) =109.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nA\u00b2 +4A\u00b2 +A\u00b2 =6A\u00b2.\n\n-48A +10A= -38A.\n\n144 +25=169.\n\nSo equation becomes:6A\u00b2 -38A +169=109.\n\nSubtract 109:6A\u00b2 -38A +60=0.\n\nDivide by 2:3A\u00b2 -19A +30=0.\n\nWhich is the same quadratic as before, but now for A.\n\nDiscriminant: 361 - 360=1.\n\nSolutions: [19\u00b11]/6 \u2192 A= (20)/6=3.333 or (18)/6=3.\n\nSince A must be a digit, A=3.\n\nSo, C=3+5=8.\n\nB=12-2*3=6.\n\nSo the number is 3 6 8 \u2192 368.\n\nWait a minute! So if the equation is ABC +495 = CBA, then the number is 368.\n\nWait, but the problem states that subtracting 495 gives the reversed number. So ABC -495 = CBA.\n\nBut in this case, 368 +495=863, which is the reversed number.\n\nWait, so perhaps the problem was meant to be ABC +495 = CBA.\n\nBut the problem statement says subtract, not add.\n\nHmm, but according to this, if the equation is ABC +495 = CBA, then the number is 368, which is option A. And 368+495=863, which is the reverse.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, and it's supposed to be adding 495, not subtracting.\n\nBut according to the problem, it's subtracting.\n\nSo, in this case, the correct answer according to the problem is 863, which isn't an option. But according to the options, option A)368 is the only one that meets the first two conditions.\n\nWait, but when I set the equation as ABC +495 = CBA, I get 368 as the number, which fits all conditions except the problem statement.\n\nSo, perhaps the intended answer is option A)368.\n\nBut I'm confused because the problem says subtract, not add. But given the options, that's the only possible choice.\n\nSo, the answer must be option A)368.\n",

The sum of its digits is 17: \\( A + B + C = 17 \\).\n2. The sum of the squares of its digits is 109: \\( A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109 \\).\n3. Subtracting 495 from the number results in a number with the same digits in reverse order: \\( ABC - 495 = CBA \\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the third condition\nFrom \\( ABC - 495 = CBA \\), we can write:\n\\[\n100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n99A - 99C = 495 \\implies A - C = 5\n\\]\nThus, \\( A = C + 5 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Substitute \\( A = C + 5 \\) into the first condition\nThe first condition becomes:\n\\[\n(C + 5) + B + C = 17 \\implies 2C + B + 5 = 17 \\implies 2C + B = 12 \\implies B = 12 - 2C\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Substitute \\( A = C + 5 \\) and \\( B = 12 - 2C \\) into the second condition\nThe second condition is:\n\\[\nA^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( A = C + 5 \\) and \\( B = 12 - 2C \\):\n\\[\n(C + 5)^2 + (12 - 2C)^2 + C^2 = 109\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\\[\nC^2 + 10C + 25 + 144 - 48C + 4C^2 + C^2 = 109\n\\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n6C^2 - 38C + 169 = 109 \\implies 6C^2 - 38C + 60 = 0\n\\]\nDivide by 2:\n\\[\n3C^2 - 19C + 30 = 0\n\\]\nSolve using the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nC = \\frac{19 \\pm \\sqrt{19^2 - 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 30}}{2 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{19 \\pm \\sqrt{361 - 360}}{6} = \\frac{19 \\pm 1}{6}\n\\]\nThis gives two solutions:\n\\[\nC = \\frac{20}{6} = 3.333 \\quad (\\text{not an integer, invalid}) \\quad \\text{or} \\quad C = \\frac{18}{6} = 3\n\\]\nThus, \\( C = 3 \\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe problem says: The sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we'll get a number with the same digits in reverse order. We have to find the original number from the options given.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, it's a three-digit number, so let's represent it as ABC, where A, B, C are its digits. So the number itself is 100*A + 10*B + C.\n\nThe first condition is that the sum of the digits is 17. So A + B + C = 17.\n\nThe second condition is that the sum of the squares of the digits is 109. So A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 = 109.\n\nThird, when we subtract 495 from the number, we get the reverse, which would be CBA. So:\n\n100*A + 10*B + C - 495 = 100*C + 10*B + A.\n\nHmm, let me write that equation down:\n\n100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A.\n\nLet me simplify this equation. Subtract the right side from both sides to bring all terms to the left.\n\n100A + 10B + C - 495 - (100C + 10B + A) = 0.\n\nExpanding that, I get:\n\n100A - A + 10B - 10B + C - 100C - 495 = 0.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n99A - 99C - 495 = 0.\n\nWait, so 99A - 99C = 495. I can factor out 99:\n\n99(A - C) = 495.\n\nDivide both sides by 99:\n\nA - C = 5.\n\nSo the difference between the hundreds digit and the units digit is 5. So A = C + 5.\n\nThat's a helpful relationship. Now, let's see what else we have.\n\nWe have two equations from the digit sums:\n\n1. A + B + C = 17\n2. A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 = 109.\n\nBut since A = C +5, I can substitute that into the first two equations.\n\nLet's substitute into equation 1:\n\n(C +5) + B + C =17.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2C + B +5 =17.\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n\n2C + B =12.\n\nSo equation 1 becomes B =12 - 2C.\n\nNow, substitute A = C+5 and B=12-2C into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2: (C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C^2 = 109.\n\nLet me expand each term.\n\nFirst term: (C+5)^2 = C\u00b2 + 10C +25.\n\nSecond term: (12-2C)^2 = (12)^2 - 2*12*2C + (2C)^2 = 144 -48C +4C\u00b2.\n\nThird term is C\u00b2.\n\nNow sum all terms:\n\n(C\u00b2 +10C +25) + (144 -48C +4C\u00b2) + C\u00b2 =109.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nC\u00b2 +4C\u00b2 +C\u00b2 = 6C\u00b2.\n\n10C -48C = -38C.\n\n25 +144 = 169.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +169 =109.\n\nSubtract 109 from both sides:\n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +60=0.\n\nSimplify this equation. Let's see if I can divide through by 2.\n\n3C\u00b2 -19C +30=0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for C.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula: C = [19 \u00b1 sqrt( (19)^2 -4*3*30 ) ]/(2*3).\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n19^2 = 361.\n\n4*3*30=360.\n\nSo discriminant is 361-360=1.\n\nSo sqrt(1)=1.\n\nSo C = [19 \u00b11]/6.\n\nSo two possibilities:\n\nC = (19+1)/6 =20/6=10/3 \u22483.333.\n\nOr C=(19-1)/6=18/6=3.\n\nWait, but C is a digit, so it must be an integer between 0 and9. So 10/3 is not an integer, so only C=3 is acceptable.\n\nSo C=3.\n\nNow, let's find A and B.\n\nA = C +5 =3+5=8.\n\nB=12-2C=12-6=6.\n\nSo the number is ABC = 8 6 3 \u2192 863.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check if this number satisfies all the conditions.\n\nFirst, the sum of digits: 8+6+3=17. Yes.\n\nSum of squares: 8\u00b2 +6\u00b2 +3\u00b2=64 +36 +9=109. Correct.\n\nNow, subtract 495: 863 -495=368. Is 368 the reverse of 863? Let's see: 863 reversed is 368. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 368. But wait, the question says that subtracting 495 gives the reversed number. So if the original is 863, then subtracting 495 gives 368, which is the reversed number. So the original number is 863. But 863 isn't one of the options. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, the options given are A)368, B)377, C)288, D)997, E)112.\n\nWait, so 863 isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, when I subtracted 495, I got 368. So 863 is the original number, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in my steps.\n\nLet me go back.\n\nWait, when I set up the equation, I assumed that the number ABC minus 495 is CBA.\n\nSo, ABC -495 = CBA.\n\nSo, 100A +10B +C -495 = 100C +10B +A.\n\nLet me rearrange that equation again.\n\n100A +10B +C -495 = 100C +10B +A.\n\nSubtract (100C +10B +A) from both sides:\n\n100A -A +10B -10B +C -100C -495 =0.\n\nWhich gives 99A -99C -495=0.\n\nDivide by 99: A - C =5. So that's correct.\n\nSo, A = C +5.\n\nThen, the sum of digits: A + B + C=17.\n\nSubstituting A: (C+5) + B + C=17 \u2192 2C + B +5=17 \u2192 2C + B=12 \u2192 B=12-2C.\n\nThen sum of squares: (C+5)^2 + B^2 + C^2=109.\n\nSubstituting B=12-2C:\n\n(C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C^2 =109.\n\nExpanding each term:\n\n(C^2 +10C +25) + (144 -48C +4C^2) + C^2.\n\nAdding them up: 6C^2 -38C + 169 =109.\n\nWait, 6C\u00b2 -38C +169=109 \u2192 6C\u00b2 -38C +60=0 \u2192 3C\u00b2 -19C +30=0.\n\nSolving, discriminant= 361-360=1.\n\nSo, C=(19\u00b11)/6 \u2192 20/6=3.333 (invalid) or 18/6=3.\n\nSo C=3. So A=8, B=6.\n\nSo the number is 863, which isn't in the options. Hmm.\n\nWait, the options don't have 863. So either I made a mistake, or perhaps I misread the question.\n\nWait, the problem says that when you subtract 495, you get the reversed number. So perhaps the original number is the reversed of the result.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the equation wrong. Let me think again.\n\nIf the original number is ABC, and when you subtract 495, you get CBA.\n\nSo ABC -495 = CBA.\n\nSo ABC = CBA +495.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as ABC = CBA +495. Maybe I should represent the equation differently.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought ABC -495 = CBA, which is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made an error in the equation setup. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, let me re-express the equation:\n\n100A +10B + C -495 = 100C +10B + A.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the sum of the squares. Let me check that.\n\nA=8, B=6, C=3.\n\nSum of squares: 64 +36 +9=109. Correct.\n\nSum of digits:17. Correct.\n\nSo, the number is 863, but it's not in the options. So perhaps I should check the options to see if any of them satisfy the conditions.\n\nLet me go through each option.\n\nOption A) 368.\n\nSum of digits: 3+6+8=17. Correct.\n\nSum of squares:9 +36 +64=109. Correct.\n\nSubtract 495: 368 -495 = -127. Hmm, negative number, which can't be a three-digit number. So this doesn't fit the third condition. Because 368 is less than 495, subtracting would give a negative, which can't be the reverse. So option A is invalid.\n\nOption B)377.\n\nSum of digits:3+7+7=17. Correct.\n\nSum of squares:9 +49 +49=107. Wait, 9+49 is 58, plus 49 is 107. But the required sum is 109. So this doesn't fit. So option B is out.\n\nOption C)288.\n\nDigits sum:2+8+8=18. Not 17. So no.\n\nOption D)997.\n\nSum:9+9+7=25. Not 17.\n\nOption E)112.\n\nSum:1+1+2=4. No.\n\nHmm, none of the options except A)368 satisfy the first two conditions. But when we subtract 495 from 368, we get a negative number, which can't be the reverse.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check the third condition again. Maybe the equation should be reversed. Like, perhaps the number is ABC, and when you subtract ABC, you get 495, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reversed number is ABC minus 495.\n\nWait, the original problem says: subtract 495 from the number, you get the reversed number.\n\nSo ABC -495 = CBA.\n\nWhich is correct as I set up earlier.\n\nBut since 368 is in the options and satisfies the first two conditions, but not the third, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if the equation could be set up differently. Maybe the number is CBA, and ABC is CBA +495. Let me think.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says subtract 495 from the number (ABC) to get the reversed (CBA). So ABC -495 = CBA.\n\nSo if I take option A)368 as the number, then 368-495= -127, which is not a three-digit number, so that can't be the case.\n\nHmm. So perhaps I made an error in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the number is such that when you subtract 495, you get the reversed number. So ABC -495 = CBA.\n\nSo, 100A +10B + C -495 = 100C +10B +A.\n\nWhich gives 99A -99C =495 \u2192 A - C=5.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nBut according to my calculations, the only possible C is 3, leading to A=8, B=6, number 863. But that's not in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares.\n\nWait, with A=8, B=6, C=3.\n\nSum of squares: 8^2=64, 6^2=36, 3^2=9. 64+36=100, +9=109. Correct.\n\nSum of digits:8+6+3=17. Correct.\n\nSo the number is 863, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation should be ABC +495 = CBA. Let me think. If I add 495 to the reversed number, do I get ABC?\n\nBut the problem says subtract 495, not add. So that might not be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the number as being larger than 495. Because if the reversed number is a three-digit number, then ABC must be larger than 495.\n\nWait, but in my solution, 863-495=368, which is a three-digit number. So that's correct.\n\nBut the options don't include 863. So perhaps I should check if any of the options satisfy the conditions.\n\nWait, let's check option A)368.\n\nSum of digits:3+6+8=17. Correct.\n\nSum of squares:9+36+64=109. Correct.\n\nNow, subtract 495: 368-495= -127. Which is a negative number, so it can't be a three-digit reversed number. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but according to the options, the only one that meets the first two conditions is A)368. But it doesn't meet the third condition.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation should be ABC - CBA = 495. Let me try that.\n\nSo, (100A +10B +C) - (100C +10B +A) =495.\n\nWhich gives 99A -99C =495 \u2192 A -C=5. Same as before.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nSo, same as before, A=C+5.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check if any of the options, when subtracted from 495, give their reverses.\n\nWait, the problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reversed number. So, ABC -495 = CBA.\n\nSo, let's check each option:\n\nOption A)368.\n\n368 -495= -127 \u2192 Not a three-digit number. So no.\n\nOption B)377.\n\n377-495= -118 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C)288-495= -207 \u2192 No.\n\nOption D)997-495=502. Reverse of 997 is 799. 502 is not 799. So no.\n\nOption E)112-495= -383 \u2192 No.\n\nSo none of the options satisfy ABC -495 = CBA except perhaps none.\n\nWait, but earlier, the correct number is 863, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the sum of squares equation.\n\nWait, let me substitute A= C+5 and B=12-2C into the sum of squares.\n\n(C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C^2 = 109.\n\nLet me compute each term again:\n\n(C+5)^2 = C\u00b2 +10C +25.\n\n(12-2C)^2 = (12)^2 - 2*(12)*(2C) + (2C)^2 \u2192 144 -48C +4C\u00b2.\n\nC^2 is just C\u00b2.\n\nAdding all three:\n\nC\u00b2 +10C +25 +144 -48C +4C\u00b2 +C\u00b2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nC\u00b2 +4C\u00b2 +C\u00b2 =6C\u00b2.\n\n10C -48C= -38C.\n\n25+144=169.\n\nSo equation:6C\u00b2 -38C +169 =109.\n\nSubtract 109:6C\u00b2-38C+60=0.\n\nDivide by 2:3C\u00b2-19C+30=0.\n\nDiscriminant:19\u00b2-4*3*30=361-360=1.\n\nSolutions: [19\u00b11]/6 \u2192 C=20/6=3.333 (invalid), or C=18/6=3.\n\nSo, C=3, A=8, B=6. So number is 863.\n\nBut again, it's not in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any of the options, when you subtract 495, give the reverse. So, for each option, compute option -495 and see if it's the reverse.\n\nOption A)368.\n\n368-495= -127 \u2192 no.\n\nOption B)377-495= -118 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C)288-495= -207 \u2192 no.\n\nOption D)997-495=502. Reverse of 997 is 799. 502\u2260799. No.\n\nOption E)112-495= -383 \u2192 no.\n\nSo none of the options satisfy the third condition.\n\nWait, but in the options, option A)368 satisfies the first two conditions, but not the third. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but the intended answer is A)368.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the third condition as ABC - CBA =495.\n\nSo, 100A +10B +C - (100C +10B +A) =495.\n\nWhich gives 99A -99C=495 \u2192 A -C=5. Same as before.\n\nSo, same as before. So perhaps the problem is that the correct answer isn't in the options, but perhaps I should choose the option that meets the first two conditions, which is A)368.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the number to be 368, and when you subtract 495, you get 368-495= -127. But that's not a valid three-digit number. So perhaps there's a mistake in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any other options could satisfy the first two conditions.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption B)377.\n\nSum of digits:3+7+7=17. Correct.\n\nSum of squares:9 +49 +49=107. Not 109. So no.\n\nOption D)997.\n\nSum:9+9+7=25. Not 17.\n\nOption E)112.\n\nSum:1+1+2=4. No.\n\nOption C)288.\n\nSum:2+8+8=18. No.\n\nSo only option A)368 meets the sum conditions.\n\nBut it doesn't meet the third condition. So perhaps the problem is expecting the answer A)368, despite the third condition not being met, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.\n\nWait, let me think: perhaps the equation is ABC - CBA =495.\n\nSo, 100A +10B +C - (100C +10B +A) =495.\n\nWhich gives 99A -99C=495 \u2192 A - C=5. Same as before.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nSo, the correct number is 863, which is not in the options. So perhaps the intended answer is option A)368, which meets the first two conditions but not the third. But that would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic equation.\n\nWait, when I substituted A and B in terms of C, I got to the quadratic equation 3C\u00b2 -19C +30=0.\n\nWait, let me check the substitution again.\n\nSum of squares equation:\n\n(C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C^2 =109.\n\nExpanding:\n\nC\u00b2 +10C +25 + (144-48C +4C\u00b2) +C\u00b2 =109.\n\nAdding like terms:\n\nC\u00b2 +4C\u00b2 +C\u00b2 =6C\u00b2.\n\n10C -48C= -38C.\n\n25+144=169.\n\nSo 6C\u00b2 -38C +169=109.\n\nSubtract 109:6C\u00b2-38C+60=0.\n\nDivide by 2:3C\u00b2-19C+30=0.\n\nDiscriminant: (19)^2 -4*3*30=361-360=1.\n\nSo roots (19\u00b11)/6 \u2192 20/6=3.333 and 18/6=3.\n\nOnly C=3 is valid.\n\nSo, no mistake there.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. The correct number is 863, which isn't in the options. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the number is the reverse of 368, which is 863, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a number in the options that when subtracted by 495 gives a reversed number. Let's check each option.\n\nOption A)368: 368-495=-127 \u2192 Not possible.\n\nOption B)377-495=-118 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C)288-495=-207 \u2192 No.\n\nOption D)997-495=502. Reverse of 997 is 799. 502\u2260799.\n\nOption E)112-495=-383 \u2192 No.\n\nSo none of the options meet the third condition. So perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options. But since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is option A)368, even though it doesn't satisfy all conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is ABC +495 = CBA. Let me try that.\n\nSo, 100A +10B +C +495=100C +10B +A.\n\nRearranged: 100A -A +10B -10B +C -100C +495=0.\n\nSo, 99A -99C +495=0 \u2192 99(A - C) =-495 \u2192 A - C= -5 \u2192 C = A +5.\n\nWait, that's a different equation. So, C = A +5.\n\nSo, A + B + C =17 \u2192 A + B + (A+5)=17 \u2192 2A + B +5=17 \u2192 2A + B=12 \u2192 B=12-2A.\n\nSum of squares: A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109.\n\nSubstituting C=A+5 and B=12-2A.\n\nSo,\n\nA\u00b2 + (12-2A)^2 + (A+5)^2 =109.\n\nExpand each term:\n\nA\u00b2 + (144 -48A +4A\u00b2) + (A\u00b2 +10A +25) =109.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nA\u00b2 +4A\u00b2 +A\u00b2 =6A\u00b2.\n\n-48A +10A= -38A.\n\n144 +25=169.\n\nSo equation becomes:6A\u00b2 -38A +169=109.\n\nSubtract 109:6A\u00b2 -38A +60=0.\n\nDivide by 2:3A\u00b2 -19A +30=0.\n\nWhich is the same quadratic as before, but now for A.\n\nDiscriminant: 361 - 360=1.\n\nSolutions: [19\u00b11]/6 \u2192 A= (20)/6=3.333 or (18)/6=3.\n\nSince A must be a digit, A=3.\n\nSo, C=3+5=8.\n\nB=12-2*3=6.\n\nSo the number is 3 6 8 \u2192 368.\n\nWait a minute! So if the equation is ABC +495 = CBA, then the number is 368.\n\nWait, but the problem states that subtracting 495 gives the reversed number. So ABC -495 = CBA.\n\nBut in this case, 368 +495=863, which is the reversed number.\n\nWait, so perhaps the problem was meant to be ABC +495 = CBA.\n\nBut the problem statement says subtract, not add.\n\nHmm, but according to this, if the equation is ABC +495 = CBA, then the number is 368, which is option A. And 368+495=863, which is the reverse.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, and it's supposed to be adding 495, not subtracting.\n\nBut according to the problem, it's subtracting.\n\nSo, in this case, the correct answer according to the problem is 863, which isn't an option. But according to the options, option A)368 is the only one that meets the first two conditions.\n\nWait, but when I set the equation as ABC +495 = CBA, I get 368 as the number, which fits all conditions except the problem statement.\n\nSo, perhaps the intended answer is option A)368.\n\nBut I'm confused because the problem says subtract, not add. But given the options, that's the only possible choice.\n\nSo, the answer must be option A)368.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding a three-digit number \\( ABC \\) (where \\( A, B, C \\) are its digits) that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. The sum of its digits is 17: \\( A + B + C = 17 \\).\n2. The sum of the squares of its digits is 109: \\( A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109 \\).\n3. Subtracting 495 from the number results in a number with the same digits in reverse order: \\( ABC - 495 = CBA \\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the third condition\nFrom \\( ABC - 495 = CBA \\), we can write:\n\\[\n100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n99A - 99C = 495 \\implies A - C = 5\n\\]\nThus, \\( A = C + 5 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Substitute \\( A = C + 5 \\) into the first condition\nThe first condition becomes:\n\\[\n(C + 5) + B + C = 17 \\implies 2C + B + 5 = 17 \\implies 2C + B = 12 \\implies B = 12 - 2C\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Substitute \\( A = C + 5 \\) and \\( B = 12 - 2C \\) into the second condition\nThe second condition is:\n\\[\nA^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( A = C + 5 \\) and \\( B = 12 - 2C \\):\n\\[\n(C + 5)^2 + (12 - 2C)^2 + C^2 = 109\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\\[\nC^2 + 10C + 25 + 144 - 48C + 4C^2 + C^2 = 109\n\\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n6C^2 - 38C + 169 = 109 \\implies 6C^2 - 38C + 60 = 0\n\\]\nDivide by 2:\n\\[\n3C^2 - 19C + 30 = 0\n\\]\nSolve using the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nC = \\frac{19 \\pm \\sqrt{19^2 - 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 30}}{2 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{19 \\pm \\sqrt{361 - 360}}{6} = \\frac{19 \\pm 1}{6}\n\\]\nThis gives two solutions:\n\\[\nC = \\frac{20}{6} = 3.333 \\quad (\\text{not an integer, invalid}) \\quad \\text{or} \\quad C = \\frac{18}{6} = 3\n\\]\nThus, \\( C = 3 \\). Substituting back:\n\\[\nA = C + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8, \\quad B = 12 - 2C = 12 - 6 = 6\n\\]\nThe number is \\( ABC = 863 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Verify the conditions for \\( ABC = 863 \\)\n1. Sum of digits: \\( 8 + 6 + 3 = 17 \\) (correct).\n2. Sum of squares: \\( 8^2 + 6^2 + 3^2 = 64 + 36 + 9 = 109 \\) (correct).\n3. Subtracting 495: \\( 863 - 495 = 368 \\), which is the reverse of 863 (correct).\n\n### Step 5: Check the options\nThe options provided are:\n- **A) 368**\n- **B) 377**\n- **C) 288**\n- **D) 997**\n- **E) 112**\n\n- **Option A (368):**\n  - Sum of digits: \\( 3 + 6 + 8 = 17 \\) (correct).\n  - Sum of squares: \\( 3^2 + 6^2 + 8^2 = 9 + 36 + 64 = 109 \\) (correct).\n  - Subtracting 495: \\( 368 - 495 = -127 \\) (not a valid three-digit number, incorrect).\n\n- **Option B (377):**\n  - Sum of digits: \\( 3 + 7 + 7 = 17 \\) (correct).\n  - Sum of squares: \\( 3^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 9 + 49 + 49 = 107 \\) (incorrect).\n\n- **Option C (288):**\n  - Sum of digits: \\( 2 + 8 + 8 = 18 \\) (incorrect).\n\n- **Option D (997):**\n  - Sum of digits: \\( 9 + 9 + 7 = 25 \\) (incorrect).\n\n- **Option E (112):**\n  - Sum of digits: \\( 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 \\) (incorrect).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct number is \\( 863 \\), but it is not among the options. Among the given options, only **A) 368** satisfies the first two conditions, but it fails the third condition. Despite this inconsistency, the intended answer is likely **A) 368** based on the options provided.\n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the three-digit number based on the given conditions. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to these kinds of problems, so I'll take it slow and see if I can work through it.\n\nFirst, the problem states that the sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17. Let's denote the three-digit number as ABC, where A, B, and C are the digits. So, the number is 100*A + 10*B + C. The sum of its digits would be A + B + C = 17.\n\nNext, the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. So that gives me another equation: A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 = 109.\n\nThen, the third condition is that if we subtract 495 from this number, we get a number with the digits reversed. So, subtracting 495 from ABC gives CBA. Mathematically, that would be:\n\nABC - 495 = CBA\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to make it easier to handle. Subtracting 100C and A from both sides, and adding 495 to both sides:\n\n100A + 10B + C - 100C - A = 495\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n99A -99C + 10B = 495\n\nI can factor out 99 from the first two terms:\n\n99(A - C) + 10B = 495\n\nHmm, maybe I can divide the entire equation by 9 to simplify it. Let's see:\n\n99 \u00f79 is 11, so 11(A - C) + (10B)/9 = 55.\n\nWait, but 10B must be divisible by 9 for this to be an integer, since B is a digit (0-9). Let me think about that. Alternatively, maybe I should keep the equation as:\n\n99(A - C) + 10B = 495.\n\nLet me think about possible values of A and C. Since A and C are digits, A is from 1-9 and C is from 0-9. Also, since the number is ABC, A can't be zero.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider that the equation is 99(A - C) +10B =495.\n\nLet me write this as 99(A - C) = 495 -10B.\n\nDivide both sides by 9: 11(A - C) = 55 - (10B)/9.\n\nWait, but 10B must be a multiple of 9 for (10B)/9 to be an integer. Because 11(A - C) and 55 are integers, the right side must also be an integer. So 10B must be divisible by 9.\n\nBut 10 and 9 are coprime, so B must be a multiple of 9. Since B is a single digit (0-9), possible B values are 0 or 9.\n\nLet me check both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: B =0\n\nThen 10B = 0. So,\n\n11(A - C) = 55 - 0 \u2192 11(A - C) =55 \u2192 A - C =5.\n\nSo A = C +5.\n\nNow, since A and C are digits, and A can't be more than 9. So C can be from 0 to 4, because if C=4, A=9. If C=5, A=10 which isn't possible. So C can be 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nNow, the sum of the digits is A + B + C =17. Since B=0,\n\nA + C =17.\n\nBut from earlier, A = C +5. So substituting,\n\n(C +5) + C =17 \u2192 2C +5=17 \u2192 2C=12 \u2192 C=6.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought C can be up to 4, but this gives C=6 which is a problem. Hmm, so this is a contradiction. So maybe B=0 is not a valid case.\n\nCase 2: B=9.\n\nThen 10B=90.\n\nSo,\n\n11(A - C) =55 - (90/9) \u2192 55 -10=45.\n\nSo 11(A - C)=45 \u2192 A - C=45/11 \u22484.09. But that's not an integer, which is impossible because A and C are integers. So this can't be right. Wait, did I make a mistake in substitution?\n\nWait, no. Let me go back.\n\nThe equation was:\n\n11(A - C) = 55 - (10B)/9.\n\nWait, when B=9, 10B=90 \u2192 90/9=10. So,\n\n11(A - C) =55 -10=45.\n\nSo A - C=45/11. Which is not an integer, so this is impossible.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So neither B=0 nor B=9 works. So maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not have divided by 9 so quickly. Let me try another approach.\n\nStarting again from the equation:\n\n99(A - C) +10B =495.\n\nLet me subtract 495 from both sides: 99(A - C) +10B -495=0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write 99(A - C) = 495 -10B.\n\nThen, 99(A - C) must equal 495 minus 10B.\n\nLet me see: 495 is 99*5. So 495 =99*5.\n\nSo 99(A - C) =99*5 -10B.\n\nDivide both sides by 99: A - C =5 - (10B)/99.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor 99 as 9*11.\n\nSo, 99(A - C) =495 -10B \u2192 9*11(A - C) = 9*55 -10B.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor 9 on the right side.\n\nWait, 495 is 9*55, so 99(A-C) = 9*55 -10B.\n\nLet me factor 9 from the right side:\n\n99(A-C) =9*(55) -10B.\n\nWait, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, let me think of 495-10B must be divisible by 99, because the left side is 99 times (A-C). So 495 -10B must be a multiple of 99.\n\nSo 495 mod 99 is zero because 99*5=495. So 495-10B must be a multiple of 99.\n\nWhich implies that 10B must be congruent to 0 mod 99. Because 495 mod99 is 0, so 0 -10B mod99=0 \u2192 10B mod99=0.\n\nSo 10B \u22610 mod99 \u2192 10B is a multiple of 99.\n\nBut since B is a digit (0-9), 10B can be 0,10,20,...,90. Which of these are multiples of 99? Only 0, since 99 is larger than 90.\n\nSo 10B=0 \u2192 B=0.\n\nWait, but earlier when B=0, I ended up with a contradiction. So perhaps I made a mistake in that case.\n\nLet me re-examine the case when B=0.\n\nSo, B=0.\n\nThen, 99(A - C) =495 - 0 \u2192 99(A - C)=495 \u2192 A - C=5.\n\nSo A = C +5.\n\nSum of digits: A + B + C =17 \u2192 (C+5) +0 + C =17 \u2192 2C +5=17 \u2192 2C=12 \u2192 C=6.\n\nSo A=6+5=11. Wait, that's impossible because A is a single digit (1-9). So this is a problem. So B=0 is not possible because it leads to A=11, which isn't allowed.\n\nHmm, so that suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the assumption that 10B must be a multiple of 99 is correct, but since B is a digit, the only possibility is B=0, which doesn't work. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider the equation again.\n\nThe equation is 99(A - C) +10B =495.\n\nLet me write this as 99(A - C) =495 -10B.\n\nLet me compute 495 -10B for B from 0 to 9 and see which values make the right side divisible by 99.\n\nSo let's compute 495 -10B for B=0 to 9:\n\nB=0 \u2192495 \u2192 495 /99=5 \u2192 yes, divisible.\n\nB=1 \u2192495-10=485 \u2192485 \u00f799\u22484.898\u2026 not integer.\n\nB=2 \u2192495-20=475 \u2192475 \u00f799\u22484.797\u2026 no.\n\nB=3 \u2192495-30=465 \u2192465 \u00f799\u22484.696\u2026 no.\n\nB=4 \u2192495-40=455 \u2192455/99\u22484.595\u2026 no.\n\nB=5 \u2192495-50=445 \u2192445/99\u22484.494\u2026 no.\n\nB=6 \u2192495-60=435 \u2192435/99\u22484.393\u2026 no.\n\nB=7 \u2192495-70=425 \u2192425/99\u22484.292\u2026 no.\n\nB=8 \u2192495-80=415 \u2192415/99\u22484.191\u2026 no.\n\nB=9 \u2192495-90=405 \u2192405/99=4.0909\u2026 no.\n\nWait, only B=0 gives a value divisible by 99. So B=0 is the only possibility. But earlier, when B=0, A = C+5 and sum of digits A + C =17. That gives C=6, A=11, which is impossible. So there's a problem here.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me go back.\n\nThe initial equation is ABC - 495 = CBA.\n\nWhich is (100A +10B +C) -495 = 100C +10B +A.\n\nLet me rearrange this correctly.\n\nSo,\n\n100A +10B + C -495 = 100C +10B + A.\n\nSubtract 100C and A from both sides, and subtract 10B from both sides:\n\n100A - A +10B -10B + C -100C = 495.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n99A -99C = 495.\n\nWait, that's different from what I had earlier. Because when I subtracted 100C and A, I think I forgot to subtract the A and 100C correctly.\n\nSo 99A -99C =495 \u2192 99(A - C) =495 \u2192 A - C =5.\n\nSo A = C +5.\n\nAh, so earlier I had an extra 10B term, but that was a mistake. So the correct equation is 99(A-C) =495 \u2192 A-C=5.\n\nSo that's a big difference. So I didn't need to involve B in this equation. So the equation gives me A = C +5.\n\nNow, the sum of digits is A + B + C =17.\n\nAnd the sum of squares is A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109.\n\nSo, now I have:\n\nA = C +5.\n\nSum: (C+5) + B + C =17 \u2192 2C + B +5=17 \u2192 2C + B=12.\n\nSo B =12 -2C.\n\nNow, since B is a digit (0-9), let's see what possible values C can take.\n\nC must be such that 2C \u226412 \u2192 C \u22646.\n\nAlso, since A = C +5, and A must be \u22649, C can be at most 4 (since 4+5=9). So C can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. Wait, wait:\n\nWait, if C=6, A=11 which is impossible. So C can be up to 4.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nC can be from 0 to 4, because when C=4, A=9. If C=5, A=10, which is invalid. So C ranges from 0 to 4.\n\nSo possible C values: 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nFor each C, compute B=12-2C, and then check if B is a valid digit (0-9).\n\nLet me list them:\n\nC=0 \u2192 B=12 \u2192 invalid (since B can't be 12)\nC=1 \u2192 B=12-2=10 \u2192 invalid\nC=2 \u2192 B=12-4=8 \u2192 valid\nC=3 \u2192 B=12-6=6 \u2192 valid\nC=4 \u2192 B=12-8=4 \u2192 valid\nC=5 \u2192 B=12-10=2 \u2192 but C=5 would make A=10, invalid\nC=6 \u2192 A=11 invalid.\n\nSo possible C values are 2,3,4.\n\nSo let's consider each possible C:\n\nCase 1: C=2 \u2192 B=8.\n\nDigits: A=7, B=8, C=2.\n\nCheck sum of squares: 7\u00b2 +8\u00b2 +2\u00b2=49 +64 +4=117. But the sum is supposed to be 109. So this doesn't work.\n\nCase 2: C=3 \u2192 B=6.\n\nDigits: A=8, B=6, C=3.\n\nSum of squares: 64 +36 +9=109. Perfect! This matches the sum of squares.\n\nWait, 64+36=100, plus 9 is 109. Yes.\n\nSo the number is 863.\n\nWait, but let's check the other condition: subtracting 495.\n\n863 -495 =368. Which is the reverse of 863? Wait, 863 reversed is 368. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the number is 863. But looking at the options, I don't see 863. Hmm, the options are A)368, B)377, C)288, D)997, E)112.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digits. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, if the number is 863, subtracting 495 gives 368, which is the reverse. So 863 is the correct number. But it's not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the possible cases.\n\nWait, let me check the next case.\n\nCase3: C=4 \u2192 B=4.\n\nDigits: A=9, B=4, C=4.\n\nSum of squares: 81 +16 +16=113. Which is more than 109. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So the only possible C that works is C=3, giving the number 863. But it's not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial equation.\n\nLet me re-examine the subtraction step.\n\nThe number is ABC, which is 100A +10B +C.\n\nSubtracting 495 gives CBA, which is 100C +10B +A.\n\nSo:\n\n100A +10B + C -495 = 100C +10B + A.\n\nSubtracting 100C and A from both sides:\n\n100A -A +10B -10B + C -100C =495.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n99A -99C =495 \u2192 99(A - C) =495 \u2192 A - C=5.\n\nYes, that's correct. So A=C+5.\n\nSo perhaps the issue is that the correct number isn't in the options, which suggests that I made a mistake elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all the options given to see if any of them meet all the conditions.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)368\n\nB)377\n\nC)288\n\nD)997\n\nE)112.\n\nLet me check each option.\n\nOption A: 368.\n\nDigits: A=3, B=6, C=8.\n\nSum of digits:3+6+8=17. Good.\n\nSum of squares:9 +36 +64=109. Good.\n\nNow, subtracting 495:368 -495= -127. Which is negative, but the problem says that subtracting 495 gives the reverse number. So negative numbers aren't considered here, as we're dealing with three-digit numbers. So this can't be right.\n\nWait, but perhaps the subtraction is done the other way: ABC - 495 = CBA.\n\nWait, 368 is ABC, so CBA is 863. Let's compute 368 -495. That's negative, so that's not possible. So option A is invalid.\n\nOption B:377.\n\nDigits: A=3, B=7, C=7.\n\nSum of digits:3+7+7=17. Good.\n\nSum of squares:9 +49 +49=107. Not 109. So this doesn't fit.\n\nOption C:288.\n\nDigits:2,8,8.\n\nSum:2+8+8=18. Not 17. So no.\n\nOption D:997.\n\nDigits:9,9,7.\n\nSum:9+9+7=25. Not 17. No.\n\nOption E:112.\n\nDigits:1,1,2.\n\nSum:1+1+2=4. Not 17. No.\n\nSo none of the options satisfy the conditions except 863, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the equation was:\n\n100A +10B + C -495 = 100C +10B + A.\n\nWhich simplifies to 99A -99C =495 \u2192 A - C=5. Correct.\n\nSo A = C +5.\n\nThen, sum of digits: (C+5) + B + C =17 \u2192 2C + B =12 \u2192 B=12-2C.\n\nNow, sum of squares: (C+5)^2 + B^2 + C^2 =109.\n\nSubstituting B=12-2C:\n\n(C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C^2 =109.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n(C\u00b2 +10C +25) + (144 -48C +4C\u00b2) + C\u00b2 =109.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nC\u00b2 +10C +25 +144 -48C +4C\u00b2 + C\u00b2 \u2192 (1+4+1)C\u00b2 + (10-48)C + (25+144) =109.\n\nSo 6C\u00b2 -38C +169 =109.\n\nSubtract 109 from both sides:\n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +60=0.\n\nDivide equation by 2:\n\n3C\u00b2 -19C +30=0.\n\nLet me solve this quadratic equation.\n\nThe discriminant D= (-19)^2 -4*3*30=361-360=1.\n\nSo C=(19 \u00b1\u221a1)/6 \u2192 (19\u00b11)/6.\n\nSo two possibilities:\n\nC=(19+1)/6=20/6=10/3\u22483.333. Not an integer.\n\nC=(19-1)/6=18/6=3.\n\nSo C=3.\n\nWhich is valid because C must be an integer between 0 and 4.\n\nSo C=3 \u2192 B=12-2*3=6.\n\nA=3+5=8.\n\nSo digits are A=8, B=6, C=3 \u2192 number is 863.\n\nWhich is what I found earlier. But none of the options match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me check the sum of squares again.\n\nWait, for 863, the digits are 8,6,3.\n\nSum of squares: 64 +36 +9=109. Correct.\n\nSum of digits:8+6+3=17. Correct.\n\nSubtracting 495:863-495=368, which is the reverse. Correct.\n\nSo the correct number is 863, but it's not in the options. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if the problem states that subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse, but maybe I should consider the number as ABC and the reverse as CBA, but perhaps the subtraction is 495 subtracted, so ABC - 495 = CBA.\n\nWait, but that's what I did. Let me check if I swapped ABC and CBA.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that ABC -495 = CBA.\n\nSo 863 -495 =368 \u2192 368 is the reverse of 863, which is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 863, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares.\n\nWait, let me recheck the sum of squares for 863.\n\n8^2=64, 6^2=36, 3^2=9. 64+36=100, plus 9 is 109. Correct.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires the number to be reversed after subtracting 495, but perhaps the number is less than 495, making the result a negative number. But that can't be a three-digit number.\n\nWait, the options provided are:\n\nA)368 \u2192 which is ABC=368. Subtract 495 \u2192 368-495=-127. Which is negative, so it's not a valid three-digit number. So this can't be the answer.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem says that when you subtract the number from 495, you get the reverse. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\"\n\nSo the number is ABC. ABC -495 = CBA.\n\nSo 368-495= -127. Which is not CBA. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check another approach. Let's look at the options and see which ones fit the sum conditions.\n\nLooking at option A:368.\n\nDigits sum:3+6+8=17. Good.\n\nSum of squares:9+36+64=109. Good.\n\nNow, subtract 495:368-495= -127. But that's not a three-digit number, so it can't be the reverse. So it's invalid.\n\nHmm, but the problem says that subtracting 495 gives the reverse, which implies that ABC >495. So the number must be greater than 495.\n\nLooking at the options, options that are greater than 495 are:\n\nA)368 \u2192 no.\n\nB)377 \u2192 no.\n\nC)288 \u2192 no.\n\nD)997 \u2192 yes.\n\nE)112 \u2192 no.\n\nSo only D)997 is greater than 495.\n\nLet me check option D:997.\n\nDigits:9,9,7.\n\nSum:9+9+7=25. Not 17. So no.\n\nSo none of the options satisfy all conditions except 863, which is not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but according to the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the process.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me try another approach: trying each option to see if it fits all conditions.\n\nOption A:368.\n\nSum of digits:3+6+8=17. Good.\n\nSum of squares:9+36+64=109. Good.\n\nSubtract 495:368-495= -127. Not a three-digit number. So no.\n\nOption B:377.\n\nSum:3+7+7=17. Good.\n\nSum of squares:9+49+49=107. Not 109. So no.\n\nOption C:288.\n\nSum:2+8+8=18. Not 17. No.\n\nOption D:997.\n\nSum:9+9+7=25. No.\n\nOption E:112.\n\nSum:1+1+2=4. No.\n\nSo none of the options satisfy all the conditions. But the problem says to choose from the given options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the equation setup. Let me think again about the subtraction.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of subtraction. The problem says subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse. So number -495 = reverse.\n\nBut maybe the reverse is a three-digit number, which implies that number -495 is positive. So number must be greater than 495.\n\nLooking at the options, only D)997 is greater than 495.\n\nBut 997-495=502, which is not the reverse of 997 (which would be 799). So 502\u2260799.\n\nSo that's not correct.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely. So maybe I made a mistake in the sum of squares.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the sum of squares for 863.\n\n8^2=64, 6^2=36, 3^2=9. 64+36=100, plus 9=109. Correct.\n\nSum of digits:17. Correct.\n\nSo 863 is the correct number, but it's not in the options. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires the number to be ABC such that ABC - CBA =495.\n\nWait, perhaps I reversed the equation. Let me see.\n\nIf ABC - CBA =495, then:\n\n(100A +10B +C) - (100C +10B +A) )=495.\n\nWhich is 99A -99C=495 \u2192 A-C=5. Same as before.\n\nSo the same conclusion applies. So the number is 863.\n\nBut again, it's not in the options. So perhaps the intended answer is A)368, but it doesn't satisfy the subtraction condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares for 863. Let me recalculate:\n\n8^2 =64\n\n6^2=36 \u2192 64+36=100.\n\n3^2=9 \u2192 100+9=109.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo I'm confident that the correct number is 863, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is not among the options, but the closest option that fits some conditions is A)368, which fits sum of digits and sum of squares, but not the subtraction condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the number to be 368, but that doesn't fit the subtraction condition.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares for 368. Let me recheck.\n\n3^2=9,6^2=36,8^2=64. Sum is 9+36=45+64=109. Correct.\n\nSo 368 meets sum of digits and sum of squares, but not the subtraction condition.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is 368, option A, but that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended for the number to be 863, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is 368, but it's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: the number is ABC, and when you subtract 495, you get CBA.\n\nSo ABC - CBA =495.\n\nWhich is (100A +10B +C) - (100C +10B +A) =495.\n\nWhich simplifies to 99A -99C =495 \u2192 A - C=5.\n\nSo A=C+5.\n\nSum of digits: A + B + C =17 \u2192 (C+5) + B + C =17 \u2192 2C + B =12 \u2192 B=12-2C.\n\nSum of squares: (C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C^2 =109.\n\nWe can expand this:\n\n(C\u00b2 +10C +25) + (144 -48C +4C\u00b2) + C\u00b2 =109.\n\nCombine terms:\n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +169 =109 \u2192 6C\u00b2 -38C +60=0 \u2192 3C\u00b2 -19C +30=0.\n\nSolutions: C=(19\u00b1\u221a(361-360))/6 \u2192 (19\u00b11)/6 \u2192 20/6=10/3 (invalid) or 18/6=3.\n\nSo C=3 \u2192 B=6 \u2192 A=8.\n\nSo the number is 863. But it's not in the options.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the problem has a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires the number to be such that when you subtract the reverse, you get 495. Let me see.\n\nIf ABC - CBA =495, then:\n\n(100A +10B +C) - (100C +10B +A) =495 \u2192 99A -99C =495 \u2192 A-C=5.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo the same conclusion holds. So the only number that fits is 863.\n\nBut the options don't include it. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, perhaps the intended answer is A)368, which fits sum of digits and sum of squares but not the subtraction condition.\n\nBut since the problem requires all three conditions to be met, the correct answer must be 863, which isn't an option. So perhaps the options are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check the subtraction again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that subtracting the number from 495 gives the reverse. So 495 - ABC = CBA.\n\nLet me check that possibility.\n\nSo 495 - ABC = CBA.\n\nWhich would be 495 - (100A +10B +C) = 100C +10B +A.\n\nRearranged: 495 =100A +10B +C +100C +10B +A.\n\nSo 495 =101A +20B +101C \u2192 101(A + C) +20B=495.\n\nHmm, that's a different equation. Let me see if this can be solved.\n\nSo 101(A + C) +20B=495.\n\nBut since A and C are digits, their sum can be at most 9+9=18, so 101*18=1818, which is way larger than 495. So perhaps this is possible.\n\nBut let me think about possible values.\n\nLet me denote S = A + C.\n\nThen 101S +20B=495.\n\nWe can write this as 101S =495 -20B.\n\nSo 495 -20B must be divisible by 101.\n\nLet me compute 495 mod 101.\n\n101 *4 =404. 495-404=91.\n\nSo 495 \u226191 mod101.\n\nSo 495 -20B \u226191 -20B mod101 must be 0.\n\nSo 20B \u226191 mod101.\n\nWe can write this as 20B \u226191 mod101.\n\nWe can solve for B:\n\nFind B such that 20B \u226191 mod101.\n\nWe can find the modular inverse of 20 mod101.\n\nFind x where 20x \u22611 mod101.\n\nUsing the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nCompute GCD(20,101):\n\n101 =5*20 +1 \u2192 1=101 -5*20.\n\nSo inverse of 20 mod101 is -5 mod101 \u2192 which is 96.\n\nSo B \u226191 *96 mod101.\n\nCompute 91 *96:\n\n91 *96 = (90*96) + (1*96) = 8640 +96=8736.\n\nNow, 8736 mod101.\n\nCompute how many times 101 fits into 8736.\n\n101*86=8686.\n\n8736-8686=50.\n\nSo B \u226150 mod101.\n\nBut B is a digit (0-9), so 50 is not a valid B. So no solution in this case.\n\nSo this suggests that the initial interpretation of the problem is correct: ABC -495 = CBA.\n\nThus, the correct number is 863, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the problem has an error, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should recheck the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the number is 368, and when you subtract 495, you get a negative number, which is not the reverse. So it's invalid. So the correct answer must be 863, but it's not in the options.\n\nSo perhaps the intended answer is option A)368, but it doesn't fit the subtraction condition. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to say that subtracting the reverse from the number gives 495, which would be ABC - CBA=495. But that's what I did earlier, leading to 863.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Since none of the options fit, but perhaps the intended answer is A)368, which fits the sum conditions but not the subtraction. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares.\n\nWait, let me recheck 368's sum of squares.\n\n3\u00b2=9,6\u00b2=36,8\u00b2=64. Sum is 9+36=45+64=109. Correct.\n\nSo 368 fits sum of digits and squares but not subtraction. So perhaps the problem intended this, but that's unclear.\n\nGiven the options, perhaps the intended answer is A)368, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem requires the number to be such that when you subtract the reverse, you get 495. So ABC - CBA=495.\n\nWhich would give us the same equation as before: A - C=5.\n\nThen, the sum of digits is 17, sum of squares is 109.\n\nWhich leads to the same solution: 863.\n\nBut it's not an option. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A)368, but it doesn't fit the subtraction condition. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to find another number that fits the sum conditions but isn't 863.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check other possibilities.\n\nWait, earlier I considered C=3, but let me see if there are other possibilities.\n\nWait, when C=3, B=6, A=8. Sum of squares is 64+36+9=109. Correct.\n\nSum of digits:17. Correct.\n\nSo 863 is the only solution.\n\nThus, the correct answer isn't among the options. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps the intended answer is A)368, but it doesn't fit the subtraction condition. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is D)997, but it doesn't fit the sum conditions.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. But according to the initial analysis, the correct number is 863, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem has a mistake. But since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the intended answer is A)368, but I'm not confident.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the three-digit number based on the given conditions. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to these kinds of problems, so I'll take it slow and see if I can work through it.\n\nFirst, the problem states that the sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17. Let's denote the three-digit number as ABC, where A, B, and C are the digits. So, the number is 100*A + 10*B + C. The sum of its digits would be A + B + C = 17.\n\nNext, the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. So that gives me another equation: A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 = 109.\n\nThen, the third condition is that if we subtract 495 from this number, we get a number with the digits reversed. So, subtracting 495 from ABC gives CBA. Mathematically, that would be:\n\nABC - 495 = CBA\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to make it easier to handle. Subtracting 100C and A from both sides, and adding 495 to both sides:\n\n100A + 10B + C - 100C - A = 495\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n99A -99C + 10B = 495\n\nI can factor out 99 from the first two terms:\n\n99(A - C) + 10B = 495\n\nHmm, maybe I can divide the entire equation by 9 to simplify it. Let's see:\n\n99 \u00f79 is 11, so 11(A - C) + (10B)/9 = 55.\n\nWait, but 10B must be divisible by 9 for this to be an integer, since B is a digit (0-9). Let me think about that. Alternatively, maybe I should keep the equation as:\n\n99(A - C) + 10B = 495.\n\nLet me think about possible values of A and C. Since A and C are digits, A is from 1-9 and C is from 0-9. Also, since the number is ABC, A can't be zero.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider that the equation is 99(A - C) +10B =495.\n\nLet me write this as 99(A - C) = 495 -10B.\n\nDivide both sides by 9: 11(A - C) = 55 - (10B)/9.\n\nWait, but 10B must be a multiple of 9 for (10B)/9 to be an integer. Because 11(A - C) and 55 are integers, the right side must also be an integer. So 10B must be divisible by 9.\n\nBut 10 and 9 are coprime, so B must be a multiple of 9. Since B is a single digit (0-9), possible B values are 0 or 9.\n\nLet me check both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: B =0\n\nThen 10B = 0. So,\n\n11(A - C) = 55 - 0 \u2192 11(A - C) =55 \u2192 A - C =5.\n\nSo A = C +5.\n\nNow, since A and C are digits, and A can't be more than 9. So C can be from 0 to 4, because if C=4, A=9. If C=5, A=10 which isn't possible. So C can be 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nNow, the sum of the digits is A + B + C =17. Since B=0,\n\nA + C =17.\n\nBut from earlier, A = C +5. So substituting,\n\n(C +5) + C =17 \u2192 2C +5=17 \u2192 2C=12 \u2192 C=6.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought C can be up to 4, but this gives C=6 which is a problem. Hmm, so this is a contradiction. So maybe B=0 is not a valid case.\n\nCase 2: B=9.\n\nThen 10B=90.\n\nSo,\n\n11(A - C) =55 - (90/9) \u2192 55 -10=45.\n\nSo 11(A - C)=45 \u2192 A - C=45/11 \u22484.09. But that's not an integer, which is impossible because A and C are integers. So this can't be right. Wait, did I make a mistake in substitution?\n\nWait, no. Let me go back.\n\nThe equation was:\n\n11(A - C) = 55 - (10B)/9.\n\nWait, when B=9, 10B=90 \u2192 90/9=10. So,\n\n11(A - C) =55 -10=45.\n\nSo A - C=45/11. Which is not an integer, so this is impossible.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So neither B=0 nor B=9 works. So maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not have divided by 9 so quickly. Let me try another approach.\n\nStarting again from the equation:\n\n99(A - C) +10B =495.\n\nLet me subtract 495 from both sides: 99(A - C) +10B -495=0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write 99(A - C) = 495 -10B.\n\nThen, 99(A - C) must equal 495 minus 10B.\n\nLet me see: 495 is 99*5. So 495 =99*5.\n\nSo 99(A - C) =99*5 -10B.\n\nDivide both sides by 99: A - C =5 - (10B)/99.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor 99 as 9*11.\n\nSo, 99(A - C) =495 -10B \u2192 9*11(A - C) = 9*55 -10B.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor 9 on the right side.\n\nWait, 495 is 9*55, so 99(A-C) = 9*55 -10B.\n\nLet me factor 9 from the right side:\n\n99(A-C) =9*(55) -10B.\n\nWait, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, let me think of 495-10B must be divisible by 99, because the left side is 99 times (A-C). So 495 -10B must be a multiple of 99.\n\nSo 495 mod 99 is zero because 99*5=495. So 495-10B must be a multiple of 99.\n\nWhich implies that 10B must be congruent to 0 mod 99. Because 495 mod99 is 0, so 0 -10B mod99=0 \u2192 10B mod99=0.\n\nSo 10B \u22610 mod99 \u2192 10B is a multiple of 99.\n\nBut since B is a digit (0-9), 10B can be 0,10,20,...,90. Which of these are multiples of 99? Only 0, since 99 is larger than 90.\n\nSo 10B=0 \u2192 B=0.\n\nWait, but earlier when B=0, I ended up with a contradiction. So perhaps I made a mistake in that case.\n\nLet me re-examine the case when B=0.\n\nSo, B=0.\n\nThen, 99(A - C) =495 - 0 \u2192 99(A - C)=495 \u2192 A - C=5.\n\nSo A = C +5.\n\nSum of digits: A + B + C =17 \u2192 (C+5) +0 + C =17 \u2192 2C +5=17 \u2192 2C=12 \u2192 C=6.\n\nSo A=6+5=11. Wait, that's impossible because A is a single digit (1-9). So this is a problem. So B=0 is not possible because it leads to A=11, which isn't allowed.\n\nHmm, so that suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the assumption that 10B must be a multiple of 99 is correct, but since B is a digit, the only possibility is B=0, which doesn't work. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider the equation again.\n\nThe equation is 99(A - C) +10B =495.\n\nLet me write this as 99(A - C) =495 -10B.\n\nLet me compute 495 -10B for B from 0 to 9 and see which values make the right side divisible by 99.\n\nSo let's compute 495 -10B for B=0 to 9:\n\nB=0 \u2192495 \u2192 495 /99=5 \u2192 yes, divisible.\n\nB=1 \u2192495-10=485 \u2192485 \u00f799\u22484.898\u2026 not integer.\n\nB=2 \u2192495-20=475 \u2192475 \u00f799\u22484.797\u2026 no.\n\nB=3 \u2192495-30=465 \u2192465 \u00f799\u22484.696\u2026 no.\n\nB=4 \u2192495-40=455 \u2192455/99\u22484.595\u2026 no.\n\nB=5 \u2192495-50=445 \u2192445/99\u22484.494\u2026 no.\n\nB=6 \u2192495-60=435 \u2192435/99\u22484.393\u2026 no.\n\nB=7 \u2192495-70=425 \u2192425/99\u22484.292\u2026 no.\n\nB=8 \u2192495-80=415 \u2192415/99\u22484.191\u2026 no.\n\nB=9 \u2192495-90=405 \u2192405/99=4.0909\u2026 no.\n\nWait, only B=0 gives a value divisible by 99. So B=0 is the only possibility. But earlier, when B=0, A = C+5 and sum of digits A + C =17. That gives C=6, A=11, which is impossible. So there's a problem here.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me go back.\n\nThe initial equation is ABC - 495 = CBA.\n\nWhich is (100A +10B +C) -495 = 100C +10B +A.\n\nLet me rearrange this correctly.\n\nSo,\n\n100A +10B + C -495 = 100C +10B + A.\n\nSubtract 100C and A from both sides, and subtract 10B from both sides:\n\n100A - A +10B -10B + C -100C = 495.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n99A -99C = 495.\n\nWait, that's different from what I had earlier. Because when I subtracted 100C and A, I think I forgot to subtract the A and 100C correctly.\n\nSo 99A -99C =495 \u2192 99(A - C) =495 \u2192 A - C =5.\n\nSo A = C +5.\n\nAh, so earlier I had an extra 10B term, but that was a mistake. So the correct equation is 99(A-C) =495 \u2192 A-C=5.\n\nSo that's a big difference. So I didn't need to involve B in this equation. So the equation gives me A = C +5.\n\nNow, the sum of digits is A + B + C =17.\n\nAnd the sum of squares is A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109.\n\nSo, now I have:\n\nA = C +5.\n\nSum: (C+5) + B + C =17 \u2192 2C + B +5=17 \u2192 2C + B=12.\n\nSo B =12 -2C.\n\nNow, since B is a digit (0-9), let's see what possible values C can take.\n\nC must be such that 2C \u226412 \u2192 C \u22646.\n\nAlso, since A = C +5, and A must be \u22649, C can be at most 4 (since 4+5=9). So C can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. Wait, wait:\n\nWait, if C=6, A=11 which is impossible. So C can be up to 4.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nC can be from 0 to 4, because when C=4, A=9. If C=5, A=10, which is invalid. So C ranges from 0 to 4.\n\nSo possible C values: 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nFor each C, compute B=12-2C, and then check if B is a valid digit (0-9).\n\nLet me list them:\n\nC=0 \u2192 B=12 \u2192 invalid (since B can't be 12)\nC=1 \u2192 B=12-2=10 \u2192 invalid\nC=2 \u2192 B=12-4=8 \u2192 valid\nC=3 \u2192 B=12-6=6 \u2192 valid\nC=4 \u2192 B=12-8=4 \u2192 valid\nC=5 \u2192 B=12-10=2 \u2192 but C=5 would make A=10, invalid\nC=6 \u2192 A=11 invalid.\n\nSo possible C values are 2,3,4.\n\nSo let's consider each possible C:\n\nCase 1: C=2 \u2192 B=8.\n\nDigits: A=7, B=8, C=2.\n\nCheck sum of squares: 7\u00b2 +8\u00b2 +2\u00b2=49 +64 +4=117. But the sum is supposed to be 109. So this doesn't work.\n\nCase 2: C=3 \u2192 B=6.\n\nDigits: A=8, B=6, C=3.\n\nSum of squares: 64 +36 +9=109. Perfect! This matches the sum of squares.\n\nWait, 64+36=100, plus 9 is 109. Yes.\n\nSo the number is 863.\n\nWait, but let's check the other condition: subtracting 495.\n\n863 -495 =368. Which is the reverse of 863? Wait, 863 reversed is 368. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the number is 863. But looking at the options, I don't see 863. Hmm, the options are A)368, B)377, C)288, D)997, E)112.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digits. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, if the number is 863, subtracting 495 gives 368, which is the reverse. So 863 is the correct number. But it's not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the possible cases.\n\nWait, let me check the next case.\n\nCase3: C=4 \u2192 B=4.\n\nDigits: A=9, B=4, C=4.\n\nSum of squares: 81 +16 +16=113. Which is more than 109. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So the only possible C that works is C=3, giving the number 863. But it's not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial equation.\n\nLet me re-examine the subtraction step.\n\nThe number is ABC, which is 100A +10B +C.\n\nSubtracting 495 gives CBA, which is 100C +10B +A.\n\nSo:\n\n100A +10B + C -495 = 100C +10B + A.\n\nSubtracting 100C and A from both sides:\n\n100A -A +10B -10B + C -100C =495.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n99A -99C =495 \u2192 99(A - C) =495 \u2192 A - C=5.\n\nYes, that's correct. So A=C+5.\n\nSo perhaps the issue is that the correct number isn't in the options, which suggests that I made a mistake elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all the options given to see if any of them meet all the conditions.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)368\n\nB)377\n\nC)288\n\nD)997\n\nE)112.\n\nLet me check each option.\n\nOption A: 368.\n\nDigits: A=3, B=6, C=8.\n\nSum of digits:3+6+8=17. Good.\n\nSum of squares:9 +36 +64=109. Good.\n\nNow, subtracting 495:368 -495= -127. Which is negative, but the problem says that subtracting 495 gives the reverse number. So negative numbers aren't considered here, as we're dealing with three-digit numbers. So this can't be right.\n\nWait, but perhaps the subtraction is done the other way: ABC - 495 = CBA.\n\nWait, 368 is ABC, so CBA is 863. Let's compute 368 -495. That's negative, so that's not possible. So option A is invalid.\n\nOption B:377.\n\nDigits: A=3, B=7, C=7.\n\nSum of digits:3+7+7=17. Good.\n\nSum of squares:9 +49 +49=107. Not 109. So this doesn't fit.\n\nOption C:288.\n\nDigits:2,8,8.\n\nSum:2+8+8=18. Not 17. So no.\n\nOption D:997.\n\nDigits:9,9,7.\n\nSum:9+9+7=25. Not 17. No.\n\nOption E:112.\n\nDigits:1,1,2.\n\nSum:1+1+2=4. Not 17. No.\n\nSo none of the options satisfy the conditions except 863, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the equation was:\n\n100A +10B + C -495 = 100C +10B + A.\n\nWhich simplifies to 99A -99C =495 \u2192 A - C=5. Correct.\n\nSo A = C +5.\n\nThen, sum of digits: (C+5) + B + C =17 \u2192 2C + B =12 \u2192 B=12-2C.\n\nNow, sum of squares: (C+5)^2 + B^2 + C^2 =109.\n\nSubstituting B=12-2C:\n\n(C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C^2 =109.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n(C\u00b2 +10C +25) + (144 -48C +4C\u00b2) + C\u00b2 =109.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nC\u00b2 +10C +25 +144 -48C +4C\u00b2 + C\u00b2 \u2192 (1+4+1)C\u00b2 + (10-48)C + (25+144) =109.\n\nSo 6C\u00b2 -38C +169 =109.\n\nSubtract 109 from both sides:\n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +60=0.\n\nDivide equation by 2:\n\n3C\u00b2 -19C +30=0.\n\nLet me solve this quadratic equation.\n\nThe discriminant D= (-19)^2 -4*3*30=361-360=1.\n\nSo C=(19 \u00b1\u221a1)/6 \u2192 (19\u00b11)/6.\n\nSo two possibilities:\n\nC=(19+1)/6=20/6=10/3\u22483.333. Not an integer.\n\nC=(19-1)/6=18/6=3.\n\nSo C=3.\n\nWhich is valid because C must be an integer between 0 and 4.\n\nSo C=3 \u2192 B=12-2*3=6.\n\nA=3+5=8.\n\nSo digits are A=8, B=6, C=3 \u2192 number is 863.\n\nWhich is what I found earlier. But none of the options match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me check the sum of squares again.\n\nWait, for 863, the digits are 8,6,3.\n\nSum of squares: 64 +36 +9=109. Correct.\n\nSum of digits:8+6+3=17. Correct.\n\nSubtracting 495:863-495=368, which is the reverse. Correct.\n\nSo the correct number is 863, but it's not in the options. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if the problem states that subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse, but maybe I should consider the number as ABC and the reverse as CBA, but perhaps the subtraction is 495 subtracted, so ABC - 495 = CBA.\n\nWait, but that's what I did. Let me check if I swapped ABC and CBA.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that ABC -495 = CBA.\n\nSo 863 -495 =368 \u2192 368 is the reverse of 863, which is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 863, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares.\n\nWait, let me recheck the sum of squares for 863.\n\n8^2=64, 6^2=36, 3^2=9. 64+36=100, plus 9 is 109. Correct.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires the number to be reversed after subtracting 495, but perhaps the number is less than 495, making the result a negative number. But that can't be a three-digit number.\n\nWait, the options provided are:\n\nA)368 \u2192 which is ABC=368. Subtract 495 \u2192 368-495=-127. Which is negative, so it's not a valid three-digit number. So this can't be the answer.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem says that when you subtract the number from 495, you get the reverse. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\"\n\nSo the number is ABC. ABC -495 = CBA.\n\nSo 368-495= -127. Which is not CBA. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check another approach. Let's look at the options and see which ones fit the sum conditions.\n\nLooking at option A:368.\n\nDigits sum:3+6+8=17. Good.\n\nSum of squares:9+36+64=109. Good.\n\nNow, subtract 495:368-495= -127. But that's not a three-digit number, so it can't be the reverse. So it's invalid.\n\nHmm, but the problem says that subtracting 495 gives the reverse, which implies that ABC >495. So the number must be greater than 495.\n\nLooking at the options, options that are greater than 495 are:\n\nA)368 \u2192 no.\n\nB)377 \u2192 no.\n\nC)288 \u2192 no.\n\nD)997 \u2192 yes.\n\nE)112 \u2192 no.\n\nSo only D)997 is greater than 495.\n\nLet me check option D:997.\n\nDigits:9,9,7.\n\nSum:9+9+7=25. Not 17. So no.\n\nSo none of the options satisfy all conditions except 863, which is not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but according to the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the process.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me try another approach: trying each option to see if it fits all conditions.\n\nOption A:368.\n\nSum of digits:3+6+8=17. Good.\n\nSum of squares:9+36+64=109. Good.\n\nSubtract 495:368-495= -127. Not a three-digit number. So no.\n\nOption B:377.\n\nSum:3+7+7=17. Good.\n\nSum of squares:9+49+49=107. Not 109. So no.\n\nOption C:288.\n\nSum:2+8+8=18. Not 17. No.\n\nOption D:997.\n\nSum:9+9+7=25. No.\n\nOption E:112.\n\nSum:1+1+2=4. No.\n\nSo none of the options satisfy all the conditions. But the problem says to choose from the given options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the equation setup. Let me think again about the subtraction.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of subtraction. The problem says subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse. So number -495 = reverse.\n\nBut maybe the reverse is a three-digit number, which implies that number -495 is positive. So number must be greater than 495.\n\nLooking at the options, only D)997 is greater than 495.\n\nBut 997-495=502, which is not the reverse of 997 (which would be 799). So 502\u2260799.\n\nSo that's not correct.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely. So maybe I made a mistake in the sum of squares.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the sum of squares for 863.\n\n8^2=64, 6^2=36, 3^2=9. 64+36=100, plus 9=109. Correct.\n\nSum of digits:17. Correct.\n\nSo 863 is the correct number, but it's not in the options. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires the number to be ABC such that ABC - CBA =495.\n\nWait, perhaps I reversed the equation. Let me see.\n\nIf ABC - CBA =495, then:\n\n(100A +10B +C) - (100C +10B +A) )=495.\n\nWhich is 99A -99C=495 \u2192 A-C=5. Same as before.\n\nSo the same conclusion applies. So the number is 863.\n\nBut again, it's not in the options. So perhaps the intended answer is A)368, but it doesn't satisfy the subtraction condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares for 863. Let me recalculate:\n\n8^2 =64\n\n6^2=36 \u2192 64+36=100.\n\n3^2=9 \u2192 100+9=109.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo I'm confident that the correct number is 863, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is not among the options, but the closest option that fits some conditions is A)368, which fits sum of digits and sum of squares, but not the subtraction condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the number to be 368, but that doesn't fit the subtraction condition.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares for 368. Let me recheck.\n\n3^2=9,6^2=36,8^2=64. Sum is 9+36=45+64=109. Correct.\n\nSo 368 meets sum of digits and sum of squares, but not the subtraction condition.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is 368, option A, but that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended for the number to be 863, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is 368, but it's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: the number is ABC, and when you subtract 495, you get CBA.\n\nSo ABC - CBA =495.\n\nWhich is (100A +10B +C) - (100C +10B +A) =495.\n\nWhich simplifies to 99A -99C =495 \u2192 A - C=5.\n\nSo A=C+5.\n\nSum of digits: A + B + C =17 \u2192 (C+5) + B + C =17 \u2192 2C + B =12 \u2192 B=12-2C.\n\nSum of squares: (C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C^2 =109.\n\nWe can expand this:\n\n(C\u00b2 +10C +25) + (144 -48C +4C\u00b2) + C\u00b2 =109.\n\nCombine terms:\n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +169 =109 \u2192 6C\u00b2 -38C +60=0 \u2192 3C\u00b2 -19C +30=0.\n\nSolutions: C=(19\u00b1\u221a(361-360))/6 \u2192 (19\u00b11)/6 \u2192 20/6=10/3 (invalid) or 18/6=3.\n\nSo C=3 \u2192 B=6 \u2192 A=8.\n\nSo the number is 863. But it's not in the options.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the problem has a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires the number to be such that when you subtract the reverse, you get 495. Let me see.\n\nIf ABC - CBA =495, then:\n\n(100A +10B +C) - (100C +10B +A) =495 \u2192 99A -99C =495 \u2192 A-C=5.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo the same conclusion holds. So the only number that fits is 863.\n\nBut the options don't include it. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, perhaps the intended answer is A)368, which fits sum of digits and sum of squares but not the subtraction condition.\n\nBut since the problem requires all three conditions to be met, the correct answer must be 863, which isn't an option. So perhaps the options are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check the subtraction again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that subtracting the number from 495 gives the reverse. So 495 - ABC = CBA.\n\nLet me check that possibility.\n\nSo 495 - ABC = CBA.\n\nWhich would be 495 - (100A +10B +C) = 100C +10B +A.\n\nRearranged: 495 =100A +10B +C +100C +10B +A.\n\nSo 495 =101A +20B +101C \u2192 101(A + C) +20B=495.\n\nHmm, that's a different equation. Let me see if this can be solved.\n\nSo 101(A + C) +20B=495.\n\nBut since A and C are digits, their sum can be at most 9+9=18, so 101*18=1818, which is way larger than 495. So perhaps this is possible.\n\nBut let me think about possible values.\n\nLet me denote S = A + C.\n\nThen 101S +20B=495.\n\nWe can write this as 101S =495 -20B.\n\nSo 495 -20B must be divisible by 101.\n\nLet me compute 495 mod 101.\n\n101 *4 =404. 495-404=91.\n\nSo 495 \u226191 mod101.\n\nSo 495 -20B \u226191 -20B mod101 must be 0.\n\nSo 20B \u226191 mod101.\n\nWe can write this as 20B \u226191 mod101.\n\nWe can solve for B:\n\nFind B such that 20B \u226191 mod101.\n\nWe can find the modular inverse of 20 mod101.\n\nFind x where 20x \u22611 mod101.\n\nUsing the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nCompute GCD(20,101):\n\n101 =5*20 +1 \u2192 1=101 -5*20.\n\nSo inverse of 20 mod101 is -5 mod101 \u2192 which is 96.\n\nSo B \u226191 *96 mod101.\n\nCompute 91 *96:\n\n91 *96 = (90*96) + (1*96) = 8640 +96=8736.\n\nNow, 8736 mod101.\n\nCompute how many times 101 fits into 8736.\n\n101*86=8686.\n\n8736-8686=50.\n\nSo B \u226150 mod101.\n\nBut B is a digit (0-9), so 50 is not a valid B. So no solution in this case.\n\nSo this suggests that the initial interpretation of the problem is correct: ABC -495 = CBA.\n\nThus, the correct number is 863, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the problem has an error, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should recheck the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the number is 368, and when you subtract 495, you get a negative number, which is not the reverse. So it's invalid. So the correct answer must be 863, but it's not in the options.\n\nSo perhaps the intended answer is option A)368, but it doesn't fit the subtraction condition. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to say that subtracting the reverse from the number gives 495, which would be ABC - CBA=495. But that's what I did earlier, leading to 863.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Since none of the options fit, but perhaps the intended answer is A)368, which fits the sum conditions but not the subtraction. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares.\n\nWait, let me recheck 368's sum of squares.\n\n3\u00b2=9,6\u00b2=36,8\u00b2=64. Sum is 9+36=45+64=109. Correct.\n\nSo 368 fits sum of digits and squares but not subtraction. So perhaps the problem intended this, but that's unclear.\n\nGiven the options, perhaps the intended answer is A)368, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem requires the number to be such that when you subtract the reverse, you get 495. So ABC - CBA=495.\n\nWhich would give us the same equation as before: A - C=5.\n\nThen, the sum of digits is 17, sum of squares is 109.\n\nWhich leads to the same solution: 863.\n\nBut it's not an option. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A)368, but it doesn't fit the subtraction condition. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to find another number that fits the sum conditions but isn't 863.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check other possibilities.\n\nWait, earlier I considered C=3, but let me see if there are other possibilities.\n\nWait, when C=3, B=6, A=8. Sum of squares is 64+36+9=109. Correct.\n\nSum of digits:17. Correct.\n\nSo 863 is the only solution.\n\nThus, the correct answer isn't among the options. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps the intended answer is A)368, but it doesn't fit the subtraction condition. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is D)997, but it doesn't fit the sum conditions.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. But according to the initial analysis, the correct number is 863, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem has a mistake. But since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the intended answer is A)368, but I'm not confident.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding a three-digit number \\( ABC \\) (where \\( A, B, C \\) are its digits) that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. The sum of its digits is \\( A + B + C = 17 \\).\n2. The sum of the squares of its digits is \\( A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109 \\).\n3. Subtracting 495 from the number results in a number with the digits reversed, i.e., \\( ABC - 495 = CBA \\).\n\n### Key Analysis:\n\n#### Condition 3: Reverse Condition\nFrom \\( ABC - 495 = CBA \\), we derive:\n\\[\n(100A + 10B + C) - 495 = 100C + 10B + A\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n99A - 99C = 495 \\implies A - C = 5 \\implies A = C + 5\n\\]\n\n#### Condition 1: Sum of Digits\nUsing \\( A = C + 5 \\), the sum of digits becomes:\n\\[\nA + B + C = (C + 5) + B + C = 2C + B + 5 = 17 \\implies 2C + B = 12 \\implies B = 12 - 2C\n\\]\n\n#### Condition 2: Sum of Squares\nSubstituting \\( A = C + 5 \\) and \\( B = 12 - 2C \\) into the sum of squares:\n\\[\nA^2 + B^2 + C^2 = (C + 5)^2 + (12 - 2C)^2 + C^2 = 109\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\\[\n(C^2 + 10C + 25) + (144 - 48C + 4C^2) + C^2 = 109\n\\]\n\\[\n6C^2 - 38C + 169 = 109 \\implies 6C^2 - 38C + 60 = 0\n\\]\nDividing by 2:\n\\[\n3C^2 - 19C + 30 = 0\n\\]\nSolving the quadratic equation:\n\\[\nC = \\frac{19 \\pm \\sqrt{361 - 360}}{6} = \\frac{19 \\pm 1}{6}\n\\]\n\\[\nC = \\frac{20}{6} = \\frac{10}{3} \\, (\\text{invalid, not an integer}) \\quad \\text{or} \\quad C = \\frac{18}{6} = 3\n\\]\nThus, \\( C = 3 \\), and substituting back:\n\\[\nA = C + 5 = 8, \\quad B = 12 - 2C = 6\n\\]\nThe number is \\( ABC = 863 \\).\n\n#### Verification:\n1. **Sum of digits**: \\( 8 + 6 + 3 = 17 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n2. **Sum of squares**: \\( 8^2 + 6^2 + 3^2 = 64 + 36 + 9 = 109 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n3. **Reverse condition**: \\( 863 - 495 = 368 \\), which is the reverse of \\( 863 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n#### Options Analysis:\nThe options provided are:\n- **A) 368**: Sum of digits \\( 3 + 6 + 8 = 17 \\), sum of squares \\( 3^2 + 6^2 + 8^2 = 9 + 36 + 64 = 109 \\). However, \\( 368 - 495 = -127 \\), which is not a valid three-digit number. \u274c\n- **B) 377**: Sum of digits \\( 3 + 7 + 7 = 17 \\), but sum of squares \\( 3^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 9 + 49 + 49 = 107 \\neq 109 \\). \u274c\n- **C) 288**: Sum of digits \\( 2 + 8 + 8 = 18 \\neq 17 \\). \u274c\n- **D) 997**: Sum of digits \\( 9 + 9 + 7 = 25 \\neq 17 \\). \u274c\n- **E) 112**: Sum of digits \\( 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 \\neq 17 \\). \u274c\n\nNone of the options satisfy all three conditions. The correct number is \\( 863 \\), which is not listed among the options. However, based on the given choices, **A) 368** satisfies the sum of digits and sum of squares but fails the subtraction condition.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct number is \\( 863 \\), but since it is not an option, the closest match based on the given choices is **A) 368**.\n\nAnswer: A",
