      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's read it carefully. The question says that n is between 36 and 72, inclusive. Then, there's this expression for x: (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16) divided by (n + 4\u221an +4). And we need to figure out which interval x falls into. The options are A to E, with E being none of these.\n\nHmm, okay. So my first thought is to simplify that expression for x. Maybe it can be factored or something. Let me write it down:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nWait, the numerator looks a bit like a quadratic in terms of \u221an. Let me see. Let's let m = \u221an. Then n = m\u00b2. So substituting, the numerator becomes m^4 + 2m*(m\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nWait, let me compute that: m^4 + 2m*(m\u00b2 +4) +16 = m^4 + 2m\u00b3 +8m +16.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Let me look at the denominator. The denominator is n +4\u221an +4, which with m becomes m\u00b2 +4m +4. Oh wait, m\u00b2 +4m +4 is (m+2)^2. That's a perfect square! So denominator simplifies to (m+2)^2.\n\nWhat about the numerator? Let me see if it can be expressed as a square as well. The numerator is m^4 + 2m\u00b3 +8m +16. Hmm, maybe grouping terms.\n\nWait, m^4 + 2m\u00b3 is m^3(m + 2). Then 8m +16 is 8(m +2). So the numerator can be written as m^3(m+2) +8(m+2) = (m^3 +8)(m+2). Wait, m^3 +8 is a sum of cubes, which factors into (m+2)(m\u00b2 -2m +4). So putting it all together:\n\nNumerator = (m+2)(m\u00b2 -2m +4)(m+2) = (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4)\n\nSo now, the numerator is (m+2)^2 times (m\u00b2 -2m +4), and the denominator is (m+2)^2. So when we divide numerator by denominator, the (m+2)^2 terms cancel out, leaving us with m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nSo x = m\u00b2 - 2m +4. But since m = \u221an, substitute back:\n\nx = (\u221an)^2 - 2\u221an +4 = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, that's a big simplification. So x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nNow, our task is to find the range of x when n is between 36 and 72.\n\nLet me denote f(n) = n - 2\u221an +4. So f(n) = n +4 - 2\u221an.\n\nWe can write this as f(n) = (n +4) - 2\u221an.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to treat f(n) as a function and find its minimum and maximum over the interval [36,72].\n\nWait, but n is between 36 and 72, which is a range of 36 to 72. Let's find the behavior of f(n). Since f(n) is a function of n, perhaps we can find its derivative to see if it's increasing or decreasing.\n\nWait, but f(n) = n +4 - 2\u221an. The derivative f\u2019(n) would be 1 - (2*(1/(2\u221an))) ) = 1 - (1/\u221an).\n\nSince n is between 36 and 72, \u221an is between 6 and around 8.485 (since 8\u00b2=64, 8.5\u00b2=72.25). So \u221an is at least 6, so 1/\u221an is at most 1/6 \u2248 0.1667.\n\nSo f\u2019(n) = 1 - (1/\u221an) would be 1 - something less than 0.1667, which is greater than 0.8333. So f\u2019(n) is positive in this interval. That means f(n) is an increasing function in [36,72].\n\nSo the minimum value of f(n) occurs at n=36, and the maximum at n=72.\n\nSo let's compute f(36) and f(72).\n\nFirst, f(36):\n\nf(36) = 36 +4 - 2\u221a36 = 40 - 2*6 = 40 -12=28.\n\nf(72) = 72 +4 - 2\u221a72.\n\nCompute \u221a72: 72 is 36*2, so \u221a72=6\u221a2 \u22486*1.4142\u22488.4852.\n\nSo f(72) =76 - 2*8.4852\u224876 -16.9704\u224859.0296.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 20 <x <54 \u2192 no, since our lower is 28 and upper is ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 our x is up to ~59.03, which is just over 58, so this option ends at 58, which is lower than our upper limit.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 our x is between 28 and ~59. So 25 <28 is not true, but 28>25. So the lower bound is 28, which is within 25-64. The upper is about 59, which is less than 64. So option C's interval is 25 <x <64, which would include our x.\n\nWait, but wait. Because our x is 28 to ~59.03. So the lower end is 28, which is above 25, and the upper is 59.03, which is below 64. So option C says 25 <x <64. So x would lie between 28 and ~59.03, which is entirely within 25 and 64. So option C would include all possible x's.\n\nBut wait, let me check the options again.\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64 \u2192 so our x is between 28 and 59.03, which is within 25 to 64. So x is in C's interval.\n\nBut wait, let me check the other options. Option D is 28 <x <60. Wait, our x is 28 to ~59.03. So 28 is the lower bound. But when n=36, x=28. So x can be as low as 28, but does it ever get below 28? No, because f(n) is increasing, so x increases from 28 to ~59.03.\n\nSo for option D, 28 <x <60 \u2192 x starts at 28. But x can be equal to 28 when n=36, which is allowed because n is \u226536. So the lower bound is 28, inclusive. But the option D says 28 <x, meaning x must be greater than 28. So x can be 28, which would not satisfy option D. So D's lower bound is 28 exclusive, but x can be 28. So D is not correct.\n\nSimilarly, option B's upper limit is 58, but x can go up to about 59.03, which is above 58. So B is not correct.\n\nOption C's lower limit is 25, which is below 28, so our x is always above 25. The upper limit is 64, which is above 59.03. So option C's interval includes all possible x's. So x is between 28 and ~59.03, which is entirely within 25 and 64. So the correct interval is C.\n\nWait, but let me recheck the calculation for f(72).\n\nf(72)=72 +4 - 2\u221a72 \u2192 76 - 2*(6\u221a2) \u2192 76 - 12\u221a2.\n\nWhat's 12\u221a2? \u221a2\u22481.4142 \u2192 12*1.4142 \u224816.9704.\n\n76-16.9704=59.0296. So correct.\n\nSo the maximum x is about 59.03.\n\nLooking at option C: 25 <x <64. So 28 is within 25-64, and 59.03 is within that. So all x's satisfy 25 <x <64.\n\nWait, but let's check if any x could be equal to 25 or 64. But in our case, the minimum x is 28, so x is always greater than 25, but the lower bound of option C is 25, which is exclusive. So x is always above 25. So the entire range is within C's interval.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n",

The standard form for a square is (a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. Let's see if I can match that.\n\nIn the numerator, the first term is n\u00b2, which is (n)^2. The last term is 16, which is (4)^2. So a is n, b is 4. Then 2ab would be 2 * n * 4 = 8n. But wait, the middle term here is 2\u221an(n +4). Let me expand that. Wait, 2\u221an (n +4) would be 2\u221an *n + 2\u221an *4, which is 2n^(3/2) + 8\u221an. That's more complicated than I thought. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator can be written as (something)^2. Let me try to see if it's (n + something)^2. Wait, let me check:\n\nLet me suppose that numerator is (n + something)^2. Let me try to see what that something would be. Let's say (n + a)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2a n + a\u00b2. Comparing to the numerator, which is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nWait, but 2a n would be 2\u221an(n+4). That would mean a = [\u221an(n+4)] / n. Let's see: a = \u221an(n+4)/n = \u221a(n+4)/\u221an. Hmm, that seems a bit messy, not sure if that's the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator is a perfect square of a binomial with a square root term. Let's think: perhaps something like (n + 4\u221an + 4)^2? Wait, because the denominator is n +4\u221an +4. Let me compute (n +4\u221an +4)^2 to see if it matches the numerator.\n\nWait, let's compute (n +4\u221an +4)^2. That would be n\u00b2 + 2*(n)*(4\u221an) + 2*(n)*4 + (4\u221an)^2 + 2*(4\u221an)*4 + 4^2. Wait, no, wait, actually, no. The correct expansion is:\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. So let's apply that.\n\na is n, b is 4\u221an, c is 4.\n\nSo:\n\na\u00b2 = n\u00b2\n\nb\u00b2 = (4\u221an)^2 = 16n\n\nc\u00b2 = 16\n\n2ab = 2 * n *4\u221an = 8n^(3/2) \n\n2ac = 2 *n *4 = 8n\n\n2bc = 2 *4\u221an *4 = 32\u221an\n\nSo adding them all up:\n\nn\u00b2 + 16n + 16 +8n^(3/2) +8n +32\u221an\n\nHmm, that's a lot. The numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let's compute that:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16 = n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an +16.\n\nWait, that's n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8n^(1/2) +16.\n\nComparing that to the expansion of the denominator squared:\n\nn\u00b2 +16n +16 +8n^(3/2) +8n +32n^(1/2).\n\nSo the denominator squared is n\u00b2 + 16n +16 +8n^(3/2) +8n +32\u221an.\n\nWait, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo the denominator squared is way bigger than the numerator. So maybe my initial thought was wrong. Maybe the numerator is not the square of the denominator.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should try to factor the numerator differently. Let me look again:\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16.\n\nLet me compute 2\u221an(n+4): that's 2\u221an *n + 2\u221an *4 = 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an.\n\nSo the numerator becomes n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be written as (n + a\u221an + b)^2. Let's see.\n\nSuppose (n + a\u221an + b)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2an^(3/2) + (a\u00b2 + 2b)n + 2ab\u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me compute each term:\n\n(n + a\u221an + b)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2a n^(3/2) + (a\u00b2 + 2b) n + 2ab \u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nWait, but when I expand it, the terms are:\n\nn\u00b2 + (a\u221an + b)^2 + 2n*(a\u221an + b) + ... Wait, perhaps I should use the standard expansion:\n\n(n + a\u221an + b)^2 = n^2 + (a\u221an)^2 + b^2 + 2n(a\u221an) + 2n b + 2(a\u221an)(b).\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nn\u00b2 + a\u00b2 n + b\u00b2 + 2a n^(3/2) + 2b n + 2ab \u221an.\n\nSo comparing to the numerator: n\u00b2 +2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo, let's set up equations based on the coefficients:\n\nn\u00b2 term: 1 on both sides. Okay.\n\nn^(3/2) term: 2a = 2 \u2192 a=1.\n\n\u221an term: 2ab =8 \u2192 2*1*b=8 \u2192 b=4.\n\nn term: 2b = 0 (because in numerator, there's no n term except the n\u00b2 and the 2n^(3/2) and 8\u221an and 16. Wait, wait, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16. So in the expansion, the n term is (a\u00b2 + 2b) n. Wait, in our case, a=1, b=4. So a\u00b2 + 2b = 1 + 8=9. So the expansion would have a 9n term. But in the numerator, there's no n term except for the n\u00b2. So that suggests that this approach might not work.\n\nWait, so maybe the numerator isn't a perfect square of a binomial with terms like n, \u221an, and constants. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator differently.\n\nLet me look at the denominator: n +4\u221an +4. Let me see if this can be written as a square or something. Let's think: maybe (\u221an + something)^2. Let's try:\n\n(\u221an + a)^2 = n + 2a\u221an + a\u00b2. So comparing to denominator: n +4\u221an +4.\n\nSo n +4\u221an +4 = (\u221an + 2)^2. Because (\u221an +2)^2 = n +4\u221an +4. Oh! That works. So denominator is (\u221an +2)^2.\n\nHmm, that's a useful observation. So denominator is (\u221an +2)^2. Now, let's see if numerator can be written in terms of \u221an.\n\nNumerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write numerator as (n + something)^2. Let me see:\n\nLet me compute (n + a)^2 = n\u00b2 +2a n +a\u00b2. But the numerator is n\u00b2 +2\u221an (n+4) +16. Let me compute 2\u221an (n+4) = 2n^(3/2) + 8\u221an. So the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator as (n + something)(something else). Alternatively, perhaps the numerator is a perfect square of (\u221an + something)^2, but with higher exponents.\n\nWait, maybe (\u221an + something)^4? Let me think, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator can be expressed as (\u221an + a)^4. Let's try:\n\n(\u221an + a)^4 = (n + 2a\u221an + a\u00b2)^2 = n\u00b2 + 4a n^(3/2) + (4a\u00b2 + 2a\u00b2) n + 4a^3 \u221an + a^4.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Let me compute (\u221an + 2)^4 and see if it matches the numerator.\n\nWait, let's compute (\u221an + 2)^4:\n\nFirst, (\u221an + 2)^2 = n +4\u221an +4, as we saw earlier.\n\nThen, squaring that: (n +4\u221an +4)^2.\n\nWhich is n\u00b2 + (4\u221an)^2 +4^2 + 2*(n*4\u221an) + 2*(n*4) + 2*(4\u221an *4).\n\nWait, wait, that's the same as before when I tried expanding the denominator squared. Which gives n\u00b2 +16n +16 + 8n^(3/2) + 8n +32\u221an.\n\nWait, but our numerator is n\u00b2 +2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16. So that's not matching. So perhaps that's not the way.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor the numerator in a different way. Let me see:\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16.\n\nLet me write it as n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) + (4)^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as (n + something)^2, but I'm not seeing it right away.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor the numerator and denominator separately and see if they can be simplified.\n\nSo, denominator is (\u221an +2)^2.\n\nNumerator: Let's see if it's a perfect square. Let me think:\n\nSuppose the numerator is (n + a\u221an + b)^2.\n\nExpanding that gives n\u00b2 + 2a n^(3/2) + (a\u00b2 + 2b) n + 2ab\u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nSet this equal to the numerator, which is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo equate the coefficients:\n\n- Coefficient of n\u00b2: 1 =1 \u2192 okay.\n\n- Coefficient of n^(3/2): 2a =2 \u2192 a=1.\n\n- Coefficient of n: a\u00b2 + 2b =0 \u2192 1 + 2b=0 \u2192 b= -0.5.\n\nBut then, the coefficient of \u221an: 2ab =8 \u2192 2*(1)*(-0.5) = -1, which is not equal to 8. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nHmm, maybe the numerator isn't a perfect square. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor it as (n + something)(something else). Let me try.\n\nWait, maybe the numerator can be written as (n + c\u221an + d)(n + e\u221an + f). Hmm, but this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can perform polynomial long division since the denominator is (\u221an +2)^2. Let me think: if I write the numerator as a multiple of the denominator plus a remainder, perhaps I can simplify the fraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution to simplify the expression. Let me let m = \u221an. Then, since n is between 36 and 72, m will be between 6 and sqrt(72), which is approximately 8.485. But since n is an integer, m would be sqrt(36)=6, sqrt(49)=7, sqrt(64)=8, etc. Wait, but n can be any integer from 36 to 72, so m can be sqrt(36)=6, sqrt(37)=~6.08, up to sqrt(72)=~8.485.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to work with m as the variable, so m = sqrt(n), so n = m\u00b2.\n\nSubstituting into the expression for x:\n\nx = [ (m\u00b2)^2 + 2m(m\u00b2 +4) +16 ] / [ m\u00b2 +4m +4 ]\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n(m^4) + 2m(m\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\n= m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16.\n\nDenominator: m\u00b2 +4m +4 = (m+2)^2.\n\nSo x = [m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16] / (m+2)^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can factor the numerator.\n\nLet me try to factor the numerator: m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16.\n\nHmm, let's look for possible factors. Maybe m^4 +2m^3 +8m +16 can be factored as (m^2 + a m + b)(m^2 + c m + d).\n\nExpanding this gives m^4 + (a +c)m^3 + (b + d + a c)m^2 + (a d +b c)m + b d.\n\nSet this equal to m^4 +2m^3 +0m^2 +8m +16.\n\nSo, we can set up equations:\n\n1. a + c = 2.\n\n2. b + d + a c = 0.\n\n3. a d + b c =8.\n\n4. b d =16.\n\nHmm, let's try possible integer values for b and d that multiply to 16.\n\nPossible pairs (b,d):\n\n(1,16), (2,8), (4,4), (-1,-16), (-2,-8), (-4,-4).\n\nLet's try (4,4): so b=4, d=4.\n\nThen equation 1: a + c=2.\n\nEquation 2: 4 +4 + a c=0 \u2192 a c =-8.\n\nEquation3: a*4 +4*c=8 \u21924a +4c=8 \u2192a +c=2, which matches equation 1.\n\nSo with a + c=2, and a c= -8.\n\nWe can solve for a and c. The possible pairs:\n\nLooking for two numbers that add up to 2 and multiply to -8.\n\nLet me think: 4 and -2 \u21924 + (-2) =2, 4*(-2)=-8.\n\nSo a=4, c= -2.\n\nSo the factors are (m^2 +4m +4)(m^2 -2m +4).\n\nCheck: (m^2+4m+4)(m^2 -2m +4) = m^4 -2m^3 +4m^2 +4m^3 -8m^2 +16m +4m^2 -8m +16.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nm^4 + ( -2m^3 +4m^3 ) + (4m^2 -8m^2 +4m^2) + (16m -8m) +16.\n\nSimplify:\n\nm^4 +2m^3 +0m^2 +8m +16. Yes! That's correct.\n\nSo numerator factors into (m\u00b2 +4m +4)(m\u00b2 -2m +4).\n\nDenominator is (m+2)^2, which is (m+2)(m+2) = m\u00b2 +4m +4.\n\nSo x becomes:\n\nx = [ (m\u00b2+4m+4)(m\u00b2 -2m +4) ] / (m+2)^2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx = [ (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4) ] / (m+2)^2.\n\nSo the (m+2)^2 terms cancel out, leaving x = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nWow, that's a big simplification! So x = m\u00b2 -2m +4, where m = sqrt(n).\n\nSo x = (sqrt(n))^2 - 2*sqrt(n) +4 = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, m is sqrt(n), so m squared is n. So yes, x = m\u00b2 -2m +4 = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nHmm, okay, so now x is expressed as n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nNow, the problem says n is between 36 and 72. So let's compute the possible range of x.\n\nBut wait, x = n - 2\u221an +4. So x is a function of n, and we can find the minimum and maximum values within n=36 to 72.\n\nLet me compute x at the endpoints and maybe find the minima or maxima in between.\n\nFirst, compute x when n=36:\n\nx = 36 - 2*sqrt(36) +4 = 36 -2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nNext, n=72:\n\nx=72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4.\n\nsqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2) \u2248 8.485.\n\nSo 2*sqrt(72) \u2248 16.97.\n\nSo x \u224872 -16.97 +4 = 72 +4 is 76, minus 16.97 is about 59.03.\n\nSo at n=36, x=28, and at n=72, x\u224859.03.\n\nBut wait, is x increasing or decreasing as n increases? Let's see.\n\nLet me consider the function f(n) = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nThe derivative with respect to n (treating n as a continuous variable) is f\u2019(n) =1 - (2)/(2\u221an) )= 1 - 1/\u221an.\n\nSet f\u2019(n)=0: 1 -1/\u221an=0 \u2192 1=1/\u221an \u2192 \u221an=1 \u2192 n=1. But our n is from 36 to72, so in this interval, 1/\u221an is always less than 1. So f\u2019(n)=1 - (something less than 1) \u2192 positive. So f(n) is increasing for n \u22651.\n\nWhich means, as n increases from 36 to72, x increases from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nSo the minimum x is 28 (at n=36), and the maximum x is about 59.03 (at n=72).\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 < x <54 \u2192 no, since x can go up to ~59.\n\nB)23 < x <58 \u2192 58 is just under the maximum of ~59.03, so x could be up to ~59, which is just above 58, so this option would exclude the upper part.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 25 is a bit higher than 28, so the lower bound is too high, since x can be 28. So this option is incorrect.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 28 is the minimum, but since x can be 28, the lower bound should be x \u226528. But the option says 28 <x, which would exclude x=28. However, when n=36, x=28, so x can be 28, so the correct range should include 28. So option D is 28 <x <60, which would exclude x=28, which is possible. So that's not correct.\n\nE)None of these.\n\nWait, but according to our calculations, x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03. So the correct range would be 28 \u2264x <60 (since 59.03 is less than 60). But the options don't include 28 \u2264x <60. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 20 <x <54 \u2192 no, since x can be up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 x can go up to ~59, which is higher than 58, so this option's upper limit is too low.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 x can be as low as 28, which is above 25, but the lower bound is 25, which is too low. So x can be 28, which is allowed in this option. But the upper bound is 64, which is way higher than x's maximum of ~59.03. So this option would include all x's, but the lower bound is 25, which is lower than 28, so this option is incorrect because x can't be lower than 28.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 x can be as low as 28, which would be excluded by this option. So the correct x's include 28, so this option is wrong.\n\nE)None of these.\n\nSo the correct answer is E) None of these, because none of the options correctly capture the range 28 \u2264x <60. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, when n=36, x=36 -2*6 +4 =36-12+4=28. Correct.\n\nAt n=72: x=72 -2*sqrt(72)+4.\n\nsqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)=approx 8.485.\n\nSo 2*sqrt(72)= approx 16.97.\n\n72 +4=76; 76-16.97=59.03.\n\nSo x can be up to approximately 59.03.\n\nSo the range of x is [28, ~59.03].\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. So x can go up to about 59, which is less than 60, so the upper limit is okay, but the lower limit is 28 <x, which would exclude x=28. Since x can be 28 when n=36, the option D is incorrect because it doesn't include x=28.\n\nSo the correct range is 28 \u2264x <60, but none of the options match exactly. So the answer should be E) None of these.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these algebra problems. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe question says that n is between 36 and 72, inclusive. So n can be any integer from 36 up to 72. Then there's this expression for x: x equals (n squared plus 2 times the square root of n times (n plus 4) plus 16) all divided by (n plus 4 times the square root of n plus 4). Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me write it down to visualize better.\n\nSo, x = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nI think I should try to simplify this expression. Maybe it's a perfect square in the numerator or something. Let's look at the numerator first: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Wait, that looks like it might be a square of something. Let me think. The standard form for a square is (a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. Let's see if I can match that.\n\nIn the numerator, the first term is n\u00b2, which is (n)^2. The last term is 16, which is (4)^2. So a is n, b is 4. Then 2ab would be 2 * n * 4 = 8n. But wait, the middle term here is 2\u221an(n +4). Let me expand that. Wait, 2\u221an (n +4) would be 2\u221an *n + 2\u221an *4, which is 2n^(3/2) + 8\u221an. That's more complicated than I thought. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator can be written as (something)^2. Let me try to see if it's (n + something)^2. Wait, let me check:\n\nLet me suppose that numerator is (n + something)^2. Let me try to see what that something would be. Let's say (n + a)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2a n + a\u00b2. Comparing to the numerator, which is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nWait, but 2a n would be 2\u221an(n+4). That would mean a = [\u221an(n+4)] / n. Let's see: a = \u221an(n+4)/n = \u221a(n+4)/\u221an. Hmm, that seems a bit messy, not sure if that's the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator is a perfect square of a binomial with a square root term. Let's think: perhaps something like (n + 4\u221an + 4)^2? Wait, because the denominator is n +4\u221an +4. Let me compute (n +4\u221an +4)^2 to see if it matches the numerator.\n\nWait, let's compute (n +4\u221an +4)^2. That would be n\u00b2 + 2*(n)*(4\u221an) + 2*(n)*4 + (4\u221an)^2 + 2*(4\u221an)*4 + 4^2. Wait, no, wait, actually, no. The correct expansion is:\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. So let's apply that.\n\na is n, b is 4\u221an, c is 4.\n\nSo:\n\na\u00b2 = n\u00b2\n\nb\u00b2 = (4\u221an)^2 = 16n\n\nc\u00b2 = 16\n\n2ab = 2 * n *4\u221an = 8n^(3/2) \n\n2ac = 2 *n *4 = 8n\n\n2bc = 2 *4\u221an *4 = 32\u221an\n\nSo adding them all up:\n\nn\u00b2 + 16n + 16 +8n^(3/2) +8n +32\u221an\n\nHmm, that's a lot. The numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let's compute that:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16 = n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an +16.\n\nWait, that's n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8n^(1/2) +16.\n\nComparing that to the expansion of the denominator squared:\n\nn\u00b2 +16n +16 +8n^(3/2) +8n +32n^(1/2).\n\nSo the denominator squared is n\u00b2 + 16n +16 +8n^(3/2) +8n +32\u221an.\n\nWait, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo the denominator squared is way bigger than the numerator. So maybe my initial thought was wrong. Maybe the numerator is not the square of the denominator.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should try to factor the numerator differently. Let me look again:\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16.\n\nLet me compute 2\u221an(n+4): that's 2\u221an *n + 2\u221an *4 = 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an.\n\nSo the numerator becomes n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be written as (n + a\u221an + b)^2. Let's see.\n\nSuppose (n + a\u221an + b)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2an^(3/2) + (a\u00b2 + 2b)n + 2ab\u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me compute each term:\n\n(n + a\u221an + b)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2a n^(3/2) + (a\u00b2 + 2b) n + 2ab \u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nWait, but when I expand it, the terms are:\n\nn\u00b2 + (a\u221an + b)^2 + 2n*(a\u221an + b) + ... Wait, perhaps I should use the standard expansion:\n\n(n + a\u221an + b)^2 = n^2 + (a\u221an)^2 + b^2 + 2n(a\u221an) + 2n b + 2(a\u221an)(b).\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nn\u00b2 + a\u00b2 n + b\u00b2 + 2a n^(3/2) + 2b n + 2ab \u221an.\n\nSo comparing to the numerator: n\u00b2 +2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo, let's set up equations based on the coefficients:\n\nn\u00b2 term: 1 on both sides. Okay.\n\nn^(3/2) term: 2a = 2 \u2192 a=1.\n\n\u221an term: 2ab =8 \u2192 2*1*b=8 \u2192 b=4.\n\nn term: 2b = 0 (because in numerator, there's no n term except the n\u00b2 and the 2n^(3/2) and 8\u221an and 16. Wait, wait, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16. So in the expansion, the n term is (a\u00b2 + 2b) n. Wait, in our case, a=1, b=4. So a\u00b2 + 2b = 1 + 8=9. So the expansion would have a 9n term. But in the numerator, there's no n term except for the n\u00b2. So that suggests that this approach might not work.\n\nWait, so maybe the numerator isn't a perfect square of a binomial with terms like n, \u221an, and constants. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator differently.\n\nLet me look at the denominator: n +4\u221an +4. Let me see if this can be written as a square or something. Let's think: maybe (\u221an + something)^2. Let's try:\n\n(\u221an + a)^2 = n + 2a\u221an + a\u00b2. So comparing to denominator: n +4\u221an +4.\n\nSo n +4\u221an +4 = (\u221an + 2)^2. Because (\u221an +2)^2 = n +4\u221an +4. Oh! That works. So denominator is (\u221an +2)^2.\n\nHmm, that's a useful observation. So denominator is (\u221an +2)^2. Now, let's see if numerator can be written in terms of \u221an.\n\nNumerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write numerator as (n + something)^2. Let me see:\n\nLet me compute (n + a)^2 = n\u00b2 +2a n +a\u00b2. But the numerator is n\u00b2 +2\u221an (n+4) +16. Let me compute 2\u221an (n+4) = 2n^(3/2) + 8\u221an. So the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator as (n + something)(something else). Alternatively, perhaps the numerator is a perfect square of (\u221an + something)^2, but with higher exponents.\n\nWait, maybe (\u221an + something)^4? Let me think, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator can be expressed as (\u221an + a)^4. Let's try:\n\n(\u221an + a)^4 = (n + 2a\u221an + a\u00b2)^2 = n\u00b2 + 4a n^(3/2) + (4a\u00b2 + 2a\u00b2) n + 4a^3 \u221an + a^4.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Let me compute (\u221an + 2)^4 and see if it matches the numerator.\n\nWait, let's compute (\u221an + 2)^4:\n\nFirst, (\u221an + 2)^2 = n +4\u221an +4, as we saw earlier.\n\nThen, squaring that: (n +4\u221an +4)^2.\n\nWhich is n\u00b2 + (4\u221an)^2 +4^2 + 2*(n*4\u221an) + 2*(n*4) + 2*(4\u221an *4).\n\nWait, wait, that's the same as before when I tried expanding the denominator squared. Which gives n\u00b2 +16n +16 + 8n^(3/2) + 8n +32\u221an.\n\nWait, but our numerator is n\u00b2 +2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16. So that's not matching. So perhaps that's not the way.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor the numerator in a different way. Let me see:\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16.\n\nLet me write it as n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) + (4)^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as (n + something)^2, but I'm not seeing it right away.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor the numerator and denominator separately and see if they can be simplified.\n\nSo, denominator is (\u221an +2)^2.\n\nNumerator: Let's see if it's a perfect square. Let me think:\n\nSuppose the numerator is (n + a\u221an + b)^2.\n\nExpanding that gives n\u00b2 + 2a n^(3/2) + (a\u00b2 + 2b) n + 2ab\u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nSet this equal to the numerator, which is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo equate the coefficients:\n\n- Coefficient of n\u00b2: 1 =1 \u2192 okay.\n\n- Coefficient of n^(3/2): 2a =2 \u2192 a=1.\n\n- Coefficient of n: a\u00b2 + 2b =0 \u2192 1 + 2b=0 \u2192 b= -0.5.\n\nBut then, the coefficient of \u221an: 2ab =8 \u2192 2*(1)*(-0.5) = -1, which is not equal to 8. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nHmm, maybe the numerator isn't a perfect square. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor it as (n + something)(something else). Let me try.\n\nWait, maybe the numerator can be written as (n + c\u221an + d)(n + e\u221an + f). Hmm, but this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can perform polynomial long division since the denominator is (\u221an +2)^2. Let me think: if I write the numerator as a multiple of the denominator plus a remainder, perhaps I can simplify the fraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution to simplify the expression. Let me let m = \u221an. Then, since n is between 36 and 72, m will be between 6 and sqrt(72), which is approximately 8.485. But since n is an integer, m would be sqrt(36)=6, sqrt(49)=7, sqrt(64)=8, etc. Wait, but n can be any integer from 36 to 72, so m can be sqrt(36)=6, sqrt(37)=~6.08, up to sqrt(72)=~8.485.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to work with m as the variable, so m = sqrt(n), so n = m\u00b2.\n\nSubstituting into the expression for x:\n\nx = [ (m\u00b2)^2 + 2m(m\u00b2 +4) +16 ] / [ m\u00b2 +4m +4 ]\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n(m^4) + 2m(m\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\n= m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16.\n\nDenominator: m\u00b2 +4m +4 = (m+2)^2.\n\nSo x = [m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16] / (m+2)^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can factor the numerator.\n\nLet me try to factor the numerator: m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16.\n\nHmm, let's look for possible factors. Maybe m^4 +2m^3 +8m +16 can be factored as (m^2 + a m + b)(m^2 + c m + d).\n\nExpanding this gives m^4 + (a +c)m^3 + (b + d + a c)m^2 + (a d +b c)m + b d.\n\nSet this equal to m^4 +2m^3 +0m^2 +8m +16.\n\nSo, we can set up equations:\n\n1. a + c = 2.\n\n2. b + d + a c = 0.\n\n3. a d + b c =8.\n\n4. b d =16.\n\nHmm, let's try possible integer values for b and d that multiply to 16.\n\nPossible pairs (b,d):\n\n(1,16), (2,8), (4,4), (-1,-16), (-2,-8), (-4,-4).\n\nLet's try (4,4): so b=4, d=4.\n\nThen equation 1: a + c=2.\n\nEquation 2: 4 +4 + a c=0 \u2192 a c =-8.\n\nEquation3: a*4 +4*c=8 \u21924a +4c=8 \u2192a +c=2, which matches equation 1.\n\nSo with a + c=2, and a c= -8.\n\nWe can solve for a and c. The possible pairs:\n\nLooking for two numbers that add up to 2 and multiply to -8.\n\nLet me think: 4 and -2 \u21924 + (-2) =2, 4*(-2)=-8.\n\nSo a=4, c= -2.\n\nSo the factors are (m^2 +4m +4)(m^2 -2m +4).\n\nCheck: (m^2+4m+4)(m^2 -2m +4) = m^4 -2m^3 +4m^2 +4m^3 -8m^2 +16m +4m^2 -8m +16.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nm^4 + ( -2m^3 +4m^3 ) + (4m^2 -8m^2 +4m^2) + (16m -8m) +16.\n\nSimplify:\n\nm^4 +2m^3 +0m^2 +8m +16. Yes! That's correct.\n\nSo numerator factors into (m\u00b2 +4m +4)(m\u00b2 -2m +4).\n\nDenominator is (m+2)^2, which is (m+2)(m+2) = m\u00b2 +4m +4.\n\nSo x becomes:\n\nx = [ (m\u00b2+4m+4)(m\u00b2 -2m +4) ] / (m+2)^2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx = [ (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4) ] / (m+2)^2.\n\nSo the (m+2)^2 terms cancel out, leaving x = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nWow, that's a big simplification! So x = m\u00b2 -2m +4, where m = sqrt(n).\n\nSo x = (sqrt(n))^2 - 2*sqrt(n) +4 = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, m is sqrt(n), so m squared is n. So yes, x = m\u00b2 -2m +4 = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nHmm, okay, so now x is expressed as n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nNow, the problem says n is between 36 and 72. So let's compute the possible range of x.\n\nBut wait, x = n - 2\u221an +4. So x is a function of n, and we can find the minimum and maximum values within n=36 to 72.\n\nLet me compute x at the endpoints and maybe find the minima or maxima in between.\n\nFirst, compute x when n=36:\n\nx = 36 - 2*sqrt(36) +4 = 36 -2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nNext, n=72:\n\nx=72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4.\n\nsqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2) \u2248 8.485.\n\nSo 2*sqrt(72) \u2248 16.97.\n\nSo x \u224872 -16.97 +4 = 72 +4 is 76, minus 16.97 is about 59.03.\n\nSo at n=36, x=28, and at n=72, x\u224859.03.\n\nBut wait, is x increasing or decreasing as n increases? Let's see.\n\nLet me consider the function f(n) = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nThe derivative with respect to n (treating n as a continuous variable) is f\u2019(n) =1 - (2)/(2\u221an) )= 1 - 1/\u221an.\n\nSet f\u2019(n)=0: 1 -1/\u221an=0 \u2192 1=1/\u221an \u2192 \u221an=1 \u2192 n=1. But our n is from 36 to72, so in this interval, 1/\u221an is always less than 1. So f\u2019(n)=1 - (something less than 1) \u2192 positive. So f(n) is increasing for n \u22651.\n\nWhich means, as n increases from 36 to72, x increases from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nSo the minimum x is 28 (at n=36), and the maximum x is about 59.03 (at n=72).\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 < x <54 \u2192 no, since x can go up to ~59.\n\nB)23 < x <58 \u2192 58 is just under the maximum of ~59.03, so x could be up to ~59, which is just above 58, so this option would exclude the upper part.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 25 is a bit higher than 28, so the lower bound is too high, since x can be 28. So this option is incorrect.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 28 is the minimum, but since x can be 28, the lower bound should be x \u226528. But the option says 28 <x, which would exclude x=28. However, when n=36, x=28, so x can be 28, so the correct range should include 28. So option D is 28 <x <60, which would exclude x=28, which is possible. So that's not correct.\n\nE)None of these.\n\nWait, but according to our calculations, x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03. So the correct range would be 28 \u2264x <60 (since 59.03 is less than 60). But the options don't include 28 \u2264x <60. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 20 <x <54 \u2192 no, since x can be up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 x can go up to ~59, which is higher than 58, so this option's upper limit is too low.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 x can be as low as 28, which is above 25, but the lower bound is 25, which is too low. So x can be 28, which is allowed in this option. But the upper bound is 64, which is way higher than x's maximum of ~59.03. So this option would include all x's, but the lower bound is 25, which is lower than 28, so this option is incorrect because x can't be lower than 28.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 x can be as low as 28, which would be excluded by this option. So the correct x's include 28, so this option is wrong.\n\nE)None of these.\n\nSo the correct answer is E) None of these, because none of the options correctly capture the range 28 \u2264x <60. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, when n=36, x=36 -2*6 +4 =36-12+4=28. Correct.\n\nAt n=72: x=72 -2*sqrt(72)+4.\n\nsqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)=approx 8.485.\n\nSo 2*sqrt(72)= approx 16.97.\n\n72 +4=76; 76-16.97=59.03.\n\nSo x can be up to approximately 59.03.\n\nSo the range of x is [28, ~59.03].\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. So x can go up to about 59, which is less than 60, so the upper limit is okay, but the lower limit is 28 <x, which would exclude x=28. Since x can be 28 when n=36, the option D is incorrect because it doesn't include x=28.\n\nSo the correct range is 28 \u2264x <60, but none of the options match exactly. So the answer should be E) None of these.\n\n\nThe problem involves evaluating the expression \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4}\n\\]\n\nfor \\( n \\) in the range \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this algebra problem to solve. Let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the range of x given that n is between 36 and 72. The expression for x is a bit complicated, so maybe I can simplify it.\n\nThe expression is x = (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16) / (n + 4\u221an +4). Hmm, wait, let me write that down again to make sure I have it right. Yeah, numerator is n squared plus 2 times the square root of n times (n plus 4), plus 16. The denominator is n plus 4 times the square root of n plus 4.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor both the numerator and the denominator. Let me look at the numerator first: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Let me see if this is a perfect square. Let's think about the form (a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. So comparing that to the numerator:\n\na\u00b2 would be n\u00b2, so a is n. Then 2ab is 2\u221an(n+4). Wait, but 2ab is 2 times a times b. So 2ab = 2n * b. But in the numerator, it's 2\u221an (n +4). So that would mean that 2n * b = 2\u221an (n +4). Hmm, that seems tricky. Let me try to see if b is \u221a(n+4) or something.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's write the numerator as n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) + (something squared). Let's see: 16 is 4\u00b2. So maybe the numerator is (n + something)^2. Let me try to set it up as (n + k)^2, where k is some expression.\n\nExpanding (n +k)^2 gives n\u00b2 + 2nk + k\u00b2. Comparing to the numerator, which is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. So 2nk must equal 2\u221an (n +4). So 2nk = 2\u221an (n+4). Dividing both sides by 2, nk = \u221an (n+4). So k = [\u221an (n+4)] / n.\n\nSimplify that: \u221an is n^(1/2), so when we divide by n (n^1), that's n^(1/2 -1) = n^(-1/2) = 1/\u221an. So k = (n +4) * (1/\u221an) = (n +4)/\u221an. Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but perhaps manageable.\n\nWait, let me compute that k. (n+4)/\u221an = \u221an + 4/(\u221an). So k = \u221an + 4/\u221an. Then, when I square (n +k), I have to make sure that the other term, k squared, is equal to 16. Because in the numerator, the last term is 16.\n\nSo, k\u00b2 = [ (\u221an + 4/\u221an) ]\u00b2 = (\u221an)^2 + 2*(\u221an)*(4/\u221an) + (4/\u221an)^2. Simplify each term: (\u221an)^2 is n. The middle term is 2*4 =8. The last term is 16/(n). So k\u00b2 = n +8 + 16/(n). But in the numerator, the last term is 16. So that doesn't match. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the numerator as a perfect square. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the numerator can be expressed as (n + a\u221an + b)^2. Let's see, expanding that would give n\u00b2 + 2a n^(3/2) + (a\u00b2 + 2b) n + 2ab \u221an + b\u00b2. Hmm, that's getting complicated, but let's see.\n\nWait, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n+4) + 16. Let me expand the 2\u221an (n+4) term: 2\u221an * n is 2n^(3/2), and 2\u221an *4 is 8\u221an. So the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo trying to see if this can be written as (n + something)^2. Let's think of the terms as n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) + something else. Alternatively, maybe the numerator is (something + something else)^2.\n\nWait, perhaps the numerator is (\u221an + m)^2, where m is some expression. Let's try that. Let (\u221an + m)^2 = n + 2\u221an m + m\u00b2. But our numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16. Hmm, that doesn't seem to fit because when I square (\u221an + m), the first term is n, but we have n squared. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nWait, maybe the numerator is (n + a\u221an + b)^2. Let me compute that: (n + a\u221an + b)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2a n^(3/2) + (a\u00b2 + 2b) n + 2ab \u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nComparing to the numerator:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo equating coefficients:\n\n- Coefficient of n\u00b2: 1 on both sides. Okay.\n- Coefficient of n^(3/2): 2a = 2 \u2192 a=1.\n- Coefficient of n: (a\u00b2 + 2b) = 0 (since numerator doesn't have an n term). Since a=1, 1 + 2b =0 \u2192 b= -0.5.\n- Coefficient of \u221an: 2ab = 8 \u2192 2*1*(-0.5) = -1. But in the numerator, it's +8. So that's a problem. Because -1 doesn't equal 8. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nHmm, maybe the numerator isn't a perfect square. Maybe I should try another approach, like simplifying the expression.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor the numerator and denominator differently. Let's write both the numerator and denominator with terms involving \u221an.\n\nLet me consider substituting t = \u221an. Then since n is between 36 and 72, t will be between \u221a36=6 and \u221a72\u22488.485. So t is between 6 and about 8.485.\n\nSo substituting t=\u221an, n = t\u00b2. Then let's rewrite x in terms of t.\n\nNumerator becomes n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16. Substituting, that's (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t (t\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nWhich is t^4 + 2t(t\u00b2 +4) +16. Let's expand that:\n\nt^4 + 2t^3 + 8t +16.\n\nDenominator is n +4\u221an +4. Substituting t, it becomes t\u00b2 +4t +4.\n\nSo now x = [t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16] / [t\u00b2 +4t +4].\n\nHmm, let's see if I can factor the denominator. t\u00b2 +4t +4 is (t+2)^2. That's good.\n\nSo denominator is (t+2)^2.\n\nNow, can I factor the numerator? Let's try.\n\nNumerator: t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nHmm, let me try to factor this. Maybe group terms.\n\nGroup first two terms and last two terms:\n\n(t^4 + 2t^3) + (8t +16) = t^3(t +2) + 8(t +2) = (t+2)(t^3 +8).\n\nOh, nice! So numerator factors into (t+2)(t^3 +8). And t^3 +8 is a sum of cubes: t^3 + 2^3 = (t +2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4).\n\nSo putting it together, numerator is (t+2)(t+2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4) = (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4).\n\nSo now, x is [ (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4) ] / [ (t+2)^2 ].\n\nThe (t+2)^2 terms cancel out, leaving x = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nOh, that's a big simplification! So x is equal to t squared minus 2t plus 4.\n\nSince t is \u221an, which is between 6 and approximately 8.485, let's find the range of x.\n\nSo x = t\u00b2 - 2t +4. Let's write that as x = (t\u00b2 -2t +1) +3 = (t-1)^2 +3. Wait, that's a useful form because it's a square plus 3, so it's always positive.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to just compute x for the lower and upper bounds of t.\n\nt is between 6 and about 8.485.\n\nCompute x at t=6: x =6\u00b2 -2*6 +4=36-12+4=28.\n\nCompute x at t=8.485: let's compute 8.485^2 is approximately (8.485)^2. Let me calculate that: 8^2 is 64, 0.485^2 is about 0.235, and cross terms: 2*8*0.485=7.76. So 64 +7.76 +0.235\u224872. So 8.485^2 is about 72. So x =72 - 2*(8.485) +4.\n\nCompute 2*8.485=16.97. So 72 -16.97=55.03; plus 4 is 59.03. So x is approximately 59.03 at the upper bound.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me be more precise. t is sqrt(n). Since n is up to 72, t is sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)= approximately 8.485281374.\n\nSo let me compute x when t=8.485281374:\n\nt\u00b2 is 72.\n\nx=72 -2*(8.485281374) +4.\n\nCompute 2*8.485281374=16.97056275.\n\nSo x=72 -16.97056275 +4= (72+4) -16.97056275=76 -16.97056275=59.02943725.\n\nSo x is approximately 59.03 when t is at maximum.\n\nWait, but wait: the original n ranges from 36 to 72. So t ranges from 6 to 8.485281374.\n\nSo x is a function of t: x = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nLet me think about whether this function is increasing or decreasing in this interval.\n\nThe function x(t)=t\u00b2 -2t +4 is a quadratic function in t, opening upwards (since the coefficient of t\u00b2 is positive). The vertex of this parabola is at t = -b/(2a) = 2/(2*1)=1. So the minimum is at t=1. Since our t is between 6 and 8.485, which is well to the right of the vertex, the function is increasing in this interval.\n\nSo the minimum x occurs at t=6, x=6\u00b2 -2*6 +4=36-12+4=28.\n\nThe maximum x occurs at t=8.485, which is approximately 59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 20 <x<54 \u2192 No, because 59 is larger than 54.\n\nB)23 <x<58 \u2192 No, since x can go up to ~59.\n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2192 28 is higher than 25, and 59 is lower than 64. So x is between 28 and 59, which is within 25-64. So this option includes all possible x values. But wait, the x minimum is 28, which is above 25, and maximum is about 59, which is below 64. So yes, x is between 28 and 59, which is within 25 and 64. So option C is 25 <x<64. So x is in that range. But wait, the question is what x satisfies, so it's possible that x is within 28 to ~59, which is a subset of option C. But the options are about ranges that x falls into. So option C says 25<x<64, which definitely includes all x in 28-59. So x satisfies option C.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the other options.\n\nOption D is 28 <x<60. So since x goes up to about 59.03, which is less than 60. So the maximum x is just under 60. So x would be between 28 and 59.03, which is entirely within 28 <x<60. So option D would also include all x.\n\nWait, but wait, the maximum x is approximately 59.03, so it's just under 60. So 28 <x <60 would include all possible x values.\n\nBut wait, what is the exact maximum? Because t is sqrt(72), which is exactly 6\u221a2.\n\nSo x when t=6\u221a2 is (6\u221a2)^2 - 2*(6\u221a2) +4.\n\nCalculating:\n\n(6\u221a2)^2 = 36 * 2=72.\n\n2*(6\u221a2)=12\u221a2\u224816.9705627485.\n\nSo x=72 -12\u221a2 +4=76 -12\u221a2.\n\nCompute 12\u221a2: \u221a2\u22481.41421356, so 12*1.41421356\u224816.97056272.\n\nSo 76 -16.97056272=59.02943728.\n\nSo x is exactly 76 -12\u221a2, which is approximately 59.0294.\n\nSo the maximum x is 76 -12\u221a2, which is about 59.0294, just under 60.\n\nSo the x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 since 59.03 is less than 60, x is less than 60. So the entire range of x is between 28 and just under 60, which is within option D.\n\nWait, but option C is 25 <x <64. So both options C and D include the entire range of x. But let's see which one is the correct one.\n\nWait, the question is which option x satisfies. So x must be within 28 and 59.03, so it's within both options C and D. But let's check the options again.\n\nWait, no, because option C's lower bound is 25, which is lower than 28. So the x's minimum is 28, so x is always above 28. So option C says x is between 25 and 64, which includes all x's, but it's not the tightest bound. Similarly, option D says 28 <x <60, which is a tighter lower bound and upper bound. So x satisfies option D.\n\nWait, but wait, let's check the options again:\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64. Since x is 28 to ~59, which is within 25 and 64. So x does satisfy option C.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the x must satisfy the given condition, and we have to choose which option is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that both C and D include x's range. But let me think again: since x is between 28 and 59, which is within 25 and 64 (option C), and also within 28 and 60 (option D). So both options C and D would be correct, but looking at the options, the correct answer would be the one that precisely captures the range.\n\nBut wait, let me look at the options again.\n\nOption C is 25 <x <64. Since x is between 28 and ~59, this is correct.\n\nOption D is 28 <x <60. Since 59.03 is less than 60, x is indeed less than 60. So x is between 28 and 59.03, which is within 28 and 60. So option D is also correct.\n\nWait, but the question is which option x satisfies. So both options C and D are correct? That can't be, because the options are exclusive. Hmm, but I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution or calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the substitution t=\u221an is correct. So x= t\u00b2-2t+4.\n\nWait, when t=6: x=36-12+4=28.\n\nWhen t=8.485281374: x=72-2*8.485281374+4=72-16.97056275+4=76-16.97056275=59.02943725.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nSo looking back at the options:\n\nA: 20 <x <54 \u2192 59 is above 54, so no.\n\nB: 23 <x <58 \u2192 59 is above 58, so no.\n\nC:25 <x <64 \u2192 Yes, 28 is above 25, and 59 is below 64.\n\nD:28 <x <60 \u2192 28 is the lower limit, and 59 is below 60, so yes.\n\nE: None of these.\n\nSo both options C and D include the range of x. But wait, the question is to choose the option that x satisfies. So perhaps the correct option is D because it's more precise, as x is always above 28.\n\nWait, but the options are presented as possible ranges, so if x is between 28 and 59, then both C and D are correct. But that can't be the case because the options are mutually exclusive.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, let me re-express x again. After simplification, x is (t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16)/(t^2 +4t +4).\n\nWe factored the numerator as (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2-2t+4), denominator as (t+2)^2. So x = t\u00b2-2t +4.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the function x(t) = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check another point in the range to make sure. Let's take t=7, which is within 6 and 8.485.\n\nx=7\u00b2 -2*7 +4=49-14+4=39.\n\nSo x is 39 when t=7, which is between 28 and 59, so that's correct.\n\nAnother point: t=8.\n\nx=64-16+4=52.\n\nYes, that's within the range.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, both C and D are possible. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the possible minimum and maximum of x.\n\nx(t) = t\u00b2 - 2t +4. Since t is in [6, 8.485], and x is a quadratic in t opening upwards, the minimum is at t=6, x=28. The maximum is at t=8.485, x\u224859.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to about 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64 \u2192 includes 28-59, correct.\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 includes 28-59, correct.\n\nBut in the options, only one can be correct. So perhaps the question is whether the maximum is less than 60.\n\nWait, 59.03 is less than 60, so the maximum is indeed less than 60. So x is between 28 and 59.03, which is within option D's range.\n\nSo the correct option is D:28 <x <60.\n\nWait, but option C's lower bound is 25, which is less than 28. So the correct answer must be D.\n\nWait, but I should check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)20 <x <54\n\nB)23 <x <58\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nE)None of these.\n\nSo if x is between 28 and approximately 59.03, which is within 28 and 60, then option D is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. The maximum x is 76 -12\u221a2. Let me compute that exactly.\n\n12\u221a2 is approximately 16.9705627485.\n\n76 -16.9705627485 = 59.0294372515.\n\nSo x is exactly 76-12\u221a2, which is approximately 59.029437.\n\nSo the upper limit is just under 59.03, which is less than 60, so option D's upper limit is 60, which includes x's maximum.\n\nSo x is between 28 and approximately 59.03, which is within 28 and 60. So option D is correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: when n is 72, t is sqrt(72)=6\u221a2, which is about 8.485. So x would be 76-12\u221a2, which is approximately 59.03.\n\nSo x is between 28 and 59.03, which is entirely within option D's range (28 <x <60) and also within option C's range (25 <x <64). But since option D's range is tighter, the correct answer should be D.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, is there any option that exactly matches the range? The options are:\n\nA: 20 <x <54 \u2192 too low on upper.\n\nB:23 <x <58 \u2192 upper limit 58 is less than 59, so no.\n\nC:25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, but not tight.\n\nD:28 <x <60 \u2192 yes, which is tighter.\n\nSo the correct answer is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this algebra problem to solve. Let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the range of x given that n is between 36 and 72. The expression for x is a bit complicated, so maybe I can simplify it.\n\nThe expression is x = (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16) / (n + 4\u221an +4). Hmm, wait, let me write that down again to make sure I have it right. Yeah, numerator is n squared plus 2 times the square root of n times (n plus 4), plus 16. The denominator is n plus 4 times the square root of n plus 4.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor both the numerator and the denominator. Let me look at the numerator first: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Let me see if this is a perfect square. Let's think about the form (a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. So comparing that to the numerator:\n\na\u00b2 would be n\u00b2, so a is n. Then 2ab is 2\u221an(n+4). Wait, but 2ab is 2 times a times b. So 2ab = 2n * b. But in the numerator, it's 2\u221an (n +4). So that would mean that 2n * b = 2\u221an (n +4). Hmm, that seems tricky. Let me try to see if b is \u221a(n+4) or something.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's write the numerator as n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) + (something squared). Let's see: 16 is 4\u00b2. So maybe the numerator is (n + something)^2. Let me try to set it up as (n + k)^2, where k is some expression.\n\nExpanding (n +k)^2 gives n\u00b2 + 2nk + k\u00b2. Comparing to the numerator, which is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. So 2nk must equal 2\u221an (n +4). So 2nk = 2\u221an (n+4). Dividing both sides by 2, nk = \u221an (n+4). So k = [\u221an (n+4)] / n.\n\nSimplify that: \u221an is n^(1/2), so when we divide by n (n^1), that's n^(1/2 -1) = n^(-1/2) = 1/\u221an. So k = (n +4) * (1/\u221an) = (n +4)/\u221an. Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but perhaps manageable.\n\nWait, let me compute that k. (n+4)/\u221an = \u221an + 4/(\u221an). So k = \u221an + 4/\u221an. Then, when I square (n +k), I have to make sure that the other term, k squared, is equal to 16. Because in the numerator, the last term is 16.\n\nSo, k\u00b2 = [ (\u221an + 4/\u221an) ]\u00b2 = (\u221an)^2 + 2*(\u221an)*(4/\u221an) + (4/\u221an)^2. Simplify each term: (\u221an)^2 is n. The middle term is 2*4 =8. The last term is 16/(n). So k\u00b2 = n +8 + 16/(n). But in the numerator, the last term is 16. So that doesn't match. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the numerator as a perfect square. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the numerator can be expressed as (n + a\u221an + b)^2. Let's see, expanding that would give n\u00b2 + 2a n^(3/2) + (a\u00b2 + 2b) n + 2ab \u221an + b\u00b2. Hmm, that's getting complicated, but let's see.\n\nWait, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n+4) + 16. Let me expand the 2\u221an (n+4) term: 2\u221an * n is 2n^(3/2), and 2\u221an *4 is 8\u221an. So the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo trying to see if this can be written as (n + something)^2. Let's think of the terms as n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) + something else. Alternatively, maybe the numerator is (something + something else)^2.\n\nWait, perhaps the numerator is (\u221an + m)^2, where m is some expression. Let's try that. Let (\u221an + m)^2 = n + 2\u221an m + m\u00b2. But our numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16. Hmm, that doesn't seem to fit because when I square (\u221an + m), the first term is n, but we have n squared. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nWait, maybe the numerator is (n + a\u221an + b)^2. Let me compute that: (n + a\u221an + b)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2a n^(3/2) + (a\u00b2 + 2b) n + 2ab \u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nComparing to the numerator:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo equating coefficients:\n\n- Coefficient of n\u00b2: 1 on both sides. Okay.\n- Coefficient of n^(3/2): 2a = 2 \u2192 a=1.\n- Coefficient of n: (a\u00b2 + 2b) = 0 (since numerator doesn't have an n term). Since a=1, 1 + 2b =0 \u2192 b= -0.5.\n- Coefficient of \u221an: 2ab = 8 \u2192 2*1*(-0.5) = -1. But in the numerator, it's +8. So that's a problem. Because -1 doesn't equal 8. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nHmm, maybe the numerator isn't a perfect square. Maybe I should try another approach, like simplifying the expression.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor the numerator and denominator differently. Let's write both the numerator and denominator with terms involving \u221an.\n\nLet me consider substituting t = \u221an. Then since n is between 36 and 72, t will be between \u221a36=6 and \u221a72\u22488.485. So t is between 6 and about 8.485.\n\nSo substituting t=\u221an, n = t\u00b2. Then let's rewrite x in terms of t.\n\nNumerator becomes n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16. Substituting, that's (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t (t\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nWhich is t^4 + 2t(t\u00b2 +4) +16. Let's expand that:\n\nt^4 + 2t^3 + 8t +16.\n\nDenominator is n +4\u221an +4. Substituting t, it becomes t\u00b2 +4t +4.\n\nSo now x = [t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16] / [t\u00b2 +4t +4].\n\nHmm, let's see if I can factor the denominator. t\u00b2 +4t +4 is (t+2)^2. That's good.\n\nSo denominator is (t+2)^2.\n\nNow, can I factor the numerator? Let's try.\n\nNumerator: t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nHmm, let me try to factor this. Maybe group terms.\n\nGroup first two terms and last two terms:\n\n(t^4 + 2t^3) + (8t +16) = t^3(t +2) + 8(t +2) = (t+2)(t^3 +8).\n\nOh, nice! So numerator factors into (t+2)(t^3 +8). And t^3 +8 is a sum of cubes: t^3 + 2^3 = (t +2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4).\n\nSo putting it together, numerator is (t+2)(t+2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4) = (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4).\n\nSo now, x is [ (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4) ] / [ (t+2)^2 ].\n\nThe (t+2)^2 terms cancel out, leaving x = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nOh, that's a big simplification! So x is equal to t squared minus 2t plus 4.\n\nSince t is \u221an, which is between 6 and approximately 8.485, let's find the range of x.\n\nSo x = t\u00b2 - 2t +4. Let's write that as x = (t\u00b2 -2t +1) +3 = (t-1)^2 +3. Wait, that's a useful form because it's a square plus 3, so it's always positive.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to just compute x for the lower and upper bounds of t.\n\nt is between 6 and about 8.485.\n\nCompute x at t=6: x =6\u00b2 -2*6 +4=36-12+4=28.\n\nCompute x at t=8.485: let's compute 8.485^2 is approximately (8.485)^2. Let me calculate that: 8^2 is 64, 0.485^2 is about 0.235, and cross terms: 2*8*0.485=7.76. So 64 +7.76 +0.235\u224872. So 8.485^2 is about 72. So x =72 - 2*(8.485) +4.\n\nCompute 2*8.485=16.97. So 72 -16.97=55.03; plus 4 is 59.03. So x is approximately 59.03 at the upper bound.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me be more precise. t is sqrt(n). Since n is up to 72, t is sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)= approximately 8.485281374.\n\nSo let me compute x when t=8.485281374:\n\nt\u00b2 is 72.\n\nx=72 -2*(8.485281374) +4.\n\nCompute 2*8.485281374=16.97056275.\n\nSo x=72 -16.97056275 +4= (72+4) -16.97056275=76 -16.97056275=59.02943725.\n\nSo x is approximately 59.03 when t is at maximum.\n\nWait, but wait: the original n ranges from 36 to 72. So t ranges from 6 to 8.485281374.\n\nSo x is a function of t: x = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nLet me think about whether this function is increasing or decreasing in this interval.\n\nThe function x(t)=t\u00b2 -2t +4 is a quadratic function in t, opening upwards (since the coefficient of t\u00b2 is positive). The vertex of this parabola is at t = -b/(2a) = 2/(2*1)=1. So the minimum is at t=1. Since our t is between 6 and 8.485, which is well to the right of the vertex, the function is increasing in this interval.\n\nSo the minimum x occurs at t=6, x=6\u00b2 -2*6 +4=36-12+4=28.\n\nThe maximum x occurs at t=8.485, which is approximately 59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 20 <x<54 \u2192 No, because 59 is larger than 54.\n\nB)23 <x<58 \u2192 No, since x can go up to ~59.\n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2192 28 is higher than 25, and 59 is lower than 64. So x is between 28 and 59, which is within 25-64. So this option includes all possible x values. But wait, the x minimum is 28, which is above 25, and maximum is about 59, which is below 64. So yes, x is between 28 and 59, which is within 25 and 64. So option C is 25 <x<64. So x is in that range. But wait, the question is what x satisfies, so it's possible that x is within 28 to ~59, which is a subset of option C. But the options are about ranges that x falls into. So option C says 25<x<64, which definitely includes all x in 28-59. So x satisfies option C.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the other options.\n\nOption D is 28 <x<60. So since x goes up to about 59.03, which is less than 60. So the maximum x is just under 60. So x would be between 28 and 59.03, which is entirely within 28 <x<60. So option D would also include all x.\n\nWait, but wait, the maximum x is approximately 59.03, so it's just under 60. So 28 <x <60 would include all possible x values.\n\nBut wait, what is the exact maximum? Because t is sqrt(72), which is exactly 6\u221a2.\n\nSo x when t=6\u221a2 is (6\u221a2)^2 - 2*(6\u221a2) +4.\n\nCalculating:\n\n(6\u221a2)^2 = 36 * 2=72.\n\n2*(6\u221a2)=12\u221a2\u224816.9705627485.\n\nSo x=72 -12\u221a2 +4=76 -12\u221a2.\n\nCompute 12\u221a2: \u221a2\u22481.41421356, so 12*1.41421356\u224816.97056272.\n\nSo 76 -16.97056272=59.02943728.\n\nSo x is exactly 76 -12\u221a2, which is approximately 59.0294.\n\nSo the maximum x is 76 -12\u221a2, which is about 59.0294, just under 60.\n\nSo the x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 since 59.03 is less than 60, x is less than 60. So the entire range of x is between 28 and just under 60, which is within option D.\n\nWait, but option C is 25 <x <64. So both options C and D include the entire range of x. But let's see which one is the correct one.\n\nWait, the question is which option x satisfies. So x must be within 28 and 59.03, so it's within both options C and D. But let's check the options again.\n\nWait, no, because option C's lower bound is 25, which is lower than 28. So the x's minimum is 28, so x is always above 28. So option C says x is between 25 and 64, which includes all x's, but it's not the tightest bound. Similarly, option D says 28 <x <60, which is a tighter lower bound and upper bound. So x satisfies option D.\n\nWait, but wait, let's check the options again:\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64. Since x is 28 to ~59, which is within 25 and 64. So x does satisfy option C.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the x must satisfy the given condition, and we have to choose which option is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that both C and D include x's range. But let me think again: since x is between 28 and 59, which is within 25 and 64 (option C), and also within 28 and 60 (option D). So both options C and D would be correct, but looking at the options, the correct answer would be the one that precisely captures the range.\n\nBut wait, let me look at the options again.\n\nOption C is 25 <x <64. Since x is between 28 and ~59, this is correct.\n\nOption D is 28 <x <60. Since 59.03 is less than 60, x is indeed less than 60. So x is between 28 and 59.03, which is within 28 and 60. So option D is also correct.\n\nWait, but the question is which option x satisfies. So both options C and D are correct? That can't be, because the options are exclusive. Hmm, but I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution or calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the substitution t=\u221an is correct. So x= t\u00b2-2t+4.\n\nWait, when t=6: x=36-12+4=28.\n\nWhen t=8.485281374: x=72-2*8.485281374+4=72-16.97056275+4=76-16.97056275=59.02943725.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nSo looking back at the options:\n\nA: 20 <x <54 \u2192 59 is above 54, so no.\n\nB: 23 <x <58 \u2192 59 is above 58, so no.\n\nC:25 <x <64 \u2192 Yes, 28 is above 25, and 59 is below 64.\n\nD:28 <x <60 \u2192 28 is the lower limit, and 59 is below 60, so yes.\n\nE: None of these.\n\nSo both options C and D include the range of x. But wait, the question is to choose the option that x satisfies. So perhaps the correct option is D because it's more precise, as x is always above 28.\n\nWait, but the options are presented as possible ranges, so if x is between 28 and 59, then both C and D are correct. But that can't be the case because the options are mutually exclusive.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, let me re-express x again. After simplification, x is (t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16)/(t^2 +4t +4).\n\nWe factored the numerator as (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2-2t+4), denominator as (t+2)^2. So x = t\u00b2-2t +4.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the function x(t) = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check another point in the range to make sure. Let's take t=7, which is within 6 and 8.485.\n\nx=7\u00b2 -2*7 +4=49-14+4=39.\n\nSo x is 39 when t=7, which is between 28 and 59, so that's correct.\n\nAnother point: t=8.\n\nx=64-16+4=52.\n\nYes, that's within the range.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, both C and D are possible. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the possible minimum and maximum of x.\n\nx(t) = t\u00b2 - 2t +4. Since t is in [6, 8.485], and x is a quadratic in t opening upwards, the minimum is at t=6, x=28. The maximum is at t=8.485, x\u224859.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to about 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64 \u2192 includes 28-59, correct.\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 includes 28-59, correct.\n\nBut in the options, only one can be correct. So perhaps the question is whether the maximum is less than 60.\n\nWait, 59.03 is less than 60, so the maximum is indeed less than 60. So x is between 28 and 59.03, which is within option D's range.\n\nSo the correct option is D:28 <x <60.\n\nWait, but option C's lower bound is 25, which is less than 28. So the correct answer must be D.\n\nWait, but I should check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)20 <x <54\n\nB)23 <x <58\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nE)None of these.\n\nSo if x is between 28 and approximately 59.03, which is within 28 and 60, then option D is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. The maximum x is 76 -12\u221a2. Let me compute that exactly.\n\n12\u221a2 is approximately 16.9705627485.\n\n76 -16.9705627485 = 59.0294372515.\n\nSo x is exactly 76-12\u221a2, which is approximately 59.029437.\n\nSo the upper limit is just under 59.03, which is less than 60, so option D's upper limit is 60, which includes x's maximum.\n\nSo x is between 28 and approximately 59.03, which is within 28 and 60. So option D is correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: when n is 72, t is sqrt(72)=6\u221a2, which is about 8.485. So x would be 76-12\u221a2, which is approximately 59.03.\n\nSo x is between 28 and 59.03, which is entirely within option D's range (28 <x <60) and also within option C's range (25 <x <64). But since option D's range is tighter, the correct answer should be D.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, is there any option that exactly matches the range? The options are:\n\nA: 20 <x <54 \u2192 too low on upper.\n\nB:23 <x <58 \u2192 upper limit 58 is less than 59, so no.\n\nC:25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, but not tight.\n\nD:28 <x <60 \u2192 yes, which is tighter.\n\nSo the correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the given expression for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Expression\nSubstitute \\( t = \\sqrt{n} \\), so \\( n = t^2 \\). The expression becomes:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{t^4 + 2t^3 + 8t + 16}{t^2 + 4t + 4}\n\\]\n\nThe denominator factors as \\( (t + 2)^2 \\). The numerator can be factored as:\n\n\\[\nt^4 + 2t^3 + 8t + 16 = (t + 2)^2(t^2 - 2t + 4)\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( x \\) simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx = t^2 - 2t + 4\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Range of \\( t \\)\nSince \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\), \\( t = \\sqrt{n} \\) ranges from \\( 6 \\) to \\( \\sqrt{72} \\approx 8.485 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze \\( x = t^2 - 2t + 4 \\)\nThe function \\( x(t) = t^2 - 2t + 4 \\) is a quadratic function opening upwards. The vertex is at \\( t = 1 \\), but since \\( t \\) is in the range \\( [6, 8.485] \\), the function is increasing in this interval.\n\n- At \\( t = 6 \\):  \n  \\[\n  x = 6^2 - 2(6) + 4 = 36 - 12 + 4 = 28\n  \\]\n\n- At \\( t = 8.485 \\):  \n  \\[\n  x = (8.485)^2 - 2(8.485) + 4 \\approx 72 - 16.97 + 4 = 59.03\n  \\]\n\nThus, \\( x \\) ranges from approximately \\( 28 \\) to \\( 59.03 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options\n- **Option A: \\( 20 < x < 54 \\)**  \n  This is incorrect because \\( x \\) exceeds \\( 54 \\).\n\n- **Option B: \\( 23 < x < 58 \\)**  \n  This is incorrect because \\( x \\) exceeds \\( 58 \\).\n\n- **Option C: \\( 25 < x < 64 \\)**  \n  This is correct because \\( x \\) is within \\( 25 \\) and \\( 64 \\).\n\n- **Option D: \\( 28 < x < 60 \\)**  \n  This is also correct because \\( x \\) is within \\( 28 \\) and \\( 60 \\).\n\n- **Option E: None of these**  \n  This is incorrect because both options C and D are valid.\n\n### Step 5: Choose the Tightest Range\nWhile both options C and D include the range of \\( x \\), option D provides a tighter upper bound (\\( 60 \\)) and matches the exact range of \\( x \\) more precisely.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says that if n is such that 36 \u2264 n \u2264 72, then x is defined by the expression (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16) divided by (n + 4\u221an + 4). And I have to figure out which interval x falls into. The options are A to E, with E being none of these.\n\nHmm. Alright, let's break this down. I'm a bit confused about where to start, but maybe simplifying the expression would help. Let's write out the expression again:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16] / [n + 4\u221an + 4]\n\nWait, that numerator and denominator look a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor them somehow. Let me look at the numerator first.\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16.\n\nLet me expand 2\u221an(n +4). That's 2\u221an * n + 2\u221an *4, which is 2n^(3/2) + 8\u221an.\n\nSo numerator becomes n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator can be written as a square. Let me see.\n\nLet me think: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nHmm, if I let a = \u221an, then n = a\u00b2. Let's try that substitution.\n\nSo, substituting a for \u221an, the numerator becomes:\n\na^4 + 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nLet me compute that: a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a + 16.\n\nWait, maybe that's a perfect square? Let me see. Suppose the numerator is (a\u00b2 + k a + m)^2. Let me try expanding that.\n\n(a\u00b2 + k a + m)^2 = a^4 + 2k a^3 + (k\u00b2 + 2m) a^2 + 2k m a + m\u00b2.\n\nComparing to our numerator, which is a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a +16.\n\nSo, equate coefficients:\n\n1. Coefficient of a^4: 1 = 1. That's fine.\n\n2. Coefficient of a^3: 2k = 2 \u2192 k=1.\n\n3. Coefficient of a^2: (k\u00b2 + 2m) = 0, because in our numerator, the a^2 term is missing. Since k=1, 1 + 2m =0 \u2192 m= -0.5.\n\nWait, but then the coefficient of a would be 2k m. Let's compute that: 2*1*(-0.5) = -1.\n\nBut in the numerator, the a term is +8a. So that would require -1 =8, which is not possible. So that approach doesn't work. Maybe the numerator isn't a perfect square, or maybe I made a mistake in substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the denominator.\n\nDenominator: n +4\u221an +4.\n\nAgain, substituting a=\u221an, so n = a\u00b2. So denominator is a\u00b2 +4a +4. Wait, that's (a+2)^2. Oh, that's a perfect square!\n\nSo denominator is (a + 2)^2.\n\nSo denominator is (sqrt(n) + 2)^2.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor the numerator in terms of a similar expression. Let me think again.\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16.\n\nWait, let's write it again in terms of a. a = sqrt(n), so n = a\u00b2.\n\nNumerator = (a\u00b2)^2 + 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\n= a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a +16.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor this as (a\u00b2 + something)(something else). Let me try to see.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator can be expressed as (a\u00b2 + 2a + 4)^2 or something similar. Let me compute (a\u00b2 + 2a +4)^2.\n\n(a\u00b2 + 2a +4)^2 = a^4 +4a^3 + (4a\u00b2 + 8a\u00b2) + ... Wait, let's compute it properly.\n\n(a\u00b2 + 2a +4)^2 = a\u00b2*(a\u00b2) + a\u00b2*(2a*2) + a\u00b2*(4*2) + (2a)^2*(a\u00b2) + ... No, perhaps expanding step by step:\n\n(a\u00b2 + 2a +4)^2 = (a\u00b2)^2 + 2*(a\u00b2)*(2a) + 2*(a\u00b2)*4 + (2a)^2 + 2*(2a)*4 +4^2.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute as (a\u00b2 + 2a +4)(a\u00b2 + 2a +4).\n\nMultiplying term by term:\n\na\u00b2 * a\u00b2 = a^4.\n\na\u00b2 * 2a = 2a^3.\n\na\u00b2 *4 = 4a\u00b2.\n\n2a * a\u00b2 = 2a^3.\n\n2a *2a =4a\u00b2.\n\n2a *4=8a.\n\n4 *a\u00b2=4a\u00b2.\n\n4 *2a=8a.\n\n4*4=16.\n\nNow, sum all these terms:\n\na^4 + (2a^3 +2a^3) + (4a\u00b2 +4a\u00b2 +4a\u00b2) + (8a +8a) +16.\n\nSimplify:\n\na^4 +4a^3 + 12a\u00b2 +16a +16.\n\nWait, but our numerator is a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16. So that doesn't match. So that's not the same. So perhaps the numerator isn't a perfect square either.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think about simplifying the entire expression for x.\n\nWe have x = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4].\n\nSince the denominator is (sqrt(n)+2)^2, maybe I can write the numerator in terms of (sqrt(n)+something) as well.\n\nWait, let me try to factor the numerator. Let me consider the numerator as a quadratic in sqrt(n). Let me see:\n\nLet me denote a = sqrt(n). Then, n = a\u00b2.\n\nSo numerator becomes a^4 + 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nExpanding that: a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a +16.\n\nHmm. Wait, maybe I can write this as (a^2 + b a + c)(a^2 + d a + e). Let's try to factor it into two quadratics.\n\nWe need to find b, c, d, e such that:\n\n(a^2 + b a + c)(a^2 + d a + e) = a^4 + (b + d) a^3 + (bd + c + e) a^2 + (be + cd) a + c e.\n\nCompare this to our numerator: a^4 + 2a^3 + 0 a^2 +8a +16.\n\nSo we have the following equations:\n\n1. b + d = 2.\n\n2. b d + c + e = 0.\n\n3. b e + c d =8.\n\n4. c e =16.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit involved, but let's try possible integer factors for equation 4: c e=16.\n\nPossible pairs for (c,e) are (1,16), (2,8), (4,4), (-1,-16), etc. Let's try positive integers first.\n\nLet's try c=4 and e=4.\n\nThen equation 4 is 4*4=16, which works.\n\nEquation 3: b*4 +4*d=8 \u21924b +4d=8 \u2192b +d=2. Wait, but equation 1 is b +d=2. So that's consistent.\n\nFrom equation 2: b*d +4 +4 =0 \u2192b d= -8.\n\nBut from equation 1, b +d=2, and b d =-8.\n\nSo the possible solutions for b and d are roots of the equation x^2 -2x -8=0. The roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +32)] /2 \u2192 [2 \u00b1 sqrt(36)]/2 \u2192 [2 \u00b16]/2 \u2192 (8/2)=4, or (-4/2)=-2.\n\nSo b=4, d=-2 or b=-2, d=4.\n\nLet me check if that works.\n\nCase 1: b=4, d=-2.\n\nThen equation 3:4*4 +4*(-2)= 16-8=8. Correct.\n\nSo then the numerator factors into (a\u00b2 +4a +4)(a\u00b2 -2a +4).\n\nWait, let's check that.\n\n(a\u00b2 +4a +4)(a\u00b2 -2a +4) = a^4 +4a^3 +4a\u00b2 -2a^3 -8a\u00b2 -16a +4a\u00b2 +16a +16.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na^4 + (4a^3 -2a^3) + (4a\u00b2 -8a\u00b2 +4a\u00b2) + (-16a +16a) +16.\n\nWhich simplifies to a^4 +2a^3 +0a\u00b2 +0a +16, which matches our numerator.\n\nSo the numerator is (a\u00b2 +4a +4)(a\u00b2 -2a +4). \n\nNow, a\u00b2 +4a +4 is (a+2)^2, so the numerator becomes (a+2)^2 (a\u00b2 -2a +4).\n\nSo, putting it all together, x is:\n\nx = [ (a+2)^2 (a\u00b2 -2a +4) ] / (a+2)^2.\n\nWait, because the denominator is (a +2)^2. So when we divide, the (a+2)^2 terms cancel out, assuming a \u2260-2, which is fine because a is sqrt(n) and n is positive.\n\nSo x simplifies to a\u00b2 -2a +4.\n\nBut a is sqrt(n), so a\u00b2 is n. So x = n - 2a +4.\n\nWhich is x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nHmm, that's a much simpler expression. So x = (n +4) - 2\u221an.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write that as x = (\u221an -1)^2 + 3, but maybe that's not necessary.\n\nSo, now we have x = n +4 -2\u221an.\n\nNow, our task is to find the range of x given that n is between 36 and 72.\n\nSo, 36 \u2264 n \u226472.\n\nLet me find the possible values of x as n varies in this interval.\n\nLet me denote t = \u221an. Since n is between 36 and72, t is between 6 and approximately 8.485 (since 8.485\u00b2 is around 72).\n\nSo t \u2208 [6, sqrt(72)].\n\nsqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485.\n\nSo, x = n +4 -2t.\n\nBut n = t\u00b2, so x = t\u00b2 +4 -2t.\n\nWhich can be written as x = t\u00b2 - 2t +4.\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic in t. Let's analyze this quadratic.\n\nThe quadratic is x(t) = t\u00b2 - 2t +4.\n\nWe can find its minimum and maximum over the interval t \u2208 [6, ~8.485].\n\nThe quadratic function x(t) is a parabola opening upwards, since the coefficient of t\u00b2 is positive. The vertex occurs at t = -b/(2a) = 2/(2*1) =1. So the minimum value is at t=1, but our interval is t from 6 to 8.485, so the function is increasing in this interval since the vertex is at t=1, which is to the left of our interval.\n\nWait, because the parabola opens upwards, and the vertex is at t=1, which is the minimum point. So for t >1, the function is increasing.\n\nSince our t starts at 6, which is greater than 1, the function x(t) is increasing as t increases from 6 to 8.485.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of x occurs at t=6, and the maximum at t=8.485.\n\nSo let's compute x at t=6 and t=8.485.\n\nAt t=6: x = 6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 =36 -12 +4=28.\n\nAt t=8.485: Let me compute t=8.485. Let me compute t\u00b2: 8.485\u00b2 is approximately 72, so t\u00b2=72.\n\nSo x=72 -2*(8.485) +4.\n\nLet me compute that: 72 +4 =76. 2*8.485=16.97.\n\nSo 76 -16.97=59.03.\n\nWait, that's approximately 59.03.\n\nWait, but wait, let me compute t= sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)\u22488.485281374.\n\nSo x(t) = (6\u221a2)^2 - 2*(6\u221a2) +4 =72 -12\u221a2 +4=76 -12\u221a2.\n\nSince sqrt(2)\u22481.41421356, 12*1.41421356\u224816.9705827.\n\nSo 76 -16.9705827\u224859.0294173.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nSo, the possible x values are between 28 and about 59.03.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption D is 28 < x <60.\n\nWhich matches, because 28 is included at the lower end, but our x starts at 28. Wait, when t=6, x=28 exactly. Since n starts at 36, which is t=6, x=28 is the minimum.\n\nWait, but in the question, n is such that 36 \u2264n \u226472. So n=36 is allowed, and so t=6 is allowed.\n\nSo x can be equal to 28 when n=36.\n\nSimilarly, when n=72, x\u224859.03, which is less than 60.\n\nSo the interval for x is [28, ~59.03]. So the options are:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 28 is higher than 20, but 59 is higher than 54. So A is not correct.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 28 is higher than 23, but 59 is higher than 58, so B is not correct.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 28 is higher than 25, 59 is less than 64. So x is between 28 and 59.03, which is within 25 and 64. So C includes the entire x range, but the lower bound is 28, which is higher than 25. So C would allow x to be 25, which is not possible. So C's lower bound is too low.\n\nWait, but wait. The x minimum is 28, so any option that includes values below 28 isn't correct. So option C's lower bound is 25, which is lower than 28. So x can't be between 25 and 28. So option C is not correct.\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60. Well, when n=36, x=28. So x can be equal to 28. So the correct interval should include 28. But option D says x is greater than 28, not greater than or equal. So for n=36, x=28, which is exactly the lower limit. So the correct interval would be 28 \u2264x <60.\n\nBut none of the options have 28 included. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)20 < x <54 \u2192 no, since x can be up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 x can go up to ~59, so no.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 x can be as low as 28, so 25 is too low. So this option would include x=28, but also includes lower values which x doesn't reach. So it's not accurate.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 So x must be greater than 28 and less than 60. But when n=36, x=28, which is exactly the lower limit. So this option excludes x=28, which is allowed. So D isn't correct.\n\nE)None of these.\n\nHmm, so the correct range is 28 \u2264x <60. But none of the options A-D include 28 as the lower bound. So the correct answer would be E) None of these.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. When n=36, x=28, so x can be 28. So the interval is [28, ~59.03). So the options don't include this exactly. Option D says x is greater than 28, which would exclude x=28, but that's part of the possible values. So the correct interval isn't captured by any of the options A-D. Hence, the answer is E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says that if n is such that 36 \u2264 n \u2264 72, then x is defined by the expression (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16) divided by (n + 4\u221an + 4). And I have to figure out which interval x falls into. The options are A to E, with E being none of these.\n\nHmm. Alright, let's break this down. I'm a bit confused about where to start, but maybe simplifying the expression would help. Let's write out the expression again:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16] / [n + 4\u221an + 4]\n\nWait, that numerator and denominator look a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor them somehow. Let me look at the numerator first.\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16.\n\nLet me expand 2\u221an(n +4). That's 2\u221an * n + 2\u221an *4, which is 2n^(3/2) + 8\u221an.\n\nSo numerator becomes n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator can be written as a square. Let me see.\n\nLet me think: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nHmm, if I let a = \u221an, then n = a\u00b2. Let's try that substitution.\n\nSo, substituting a for \u221an, the numerator becomes:\n\na^4 + 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nLet me compute that: a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a + 16.\n\nWait, maybe that's a perfect square? Let me see. Suppose the numerator is (a\u00b2 + k a + m)^2. Let me try expanding that.\n\n(a\u00b2 + k a + m)^2 = a^4 + 2k a^3 + (k\u00b2 + 2m) a^2 + 2k m a + m\u00b2.\n\nComparing to our numerator, which is a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a +16.\n\nSo, equate coefficients:\n\n1.

Since k=1, 1 + 2m =0 \u2192 m= -0.5.\n\nWait, but then the coefficient of a would be 2k m. Let's compute that: 2*1*(-0.5) = -1.\n\nBut in the numerator, the a term is +8a.

Let's try to factor it into two quadratics.\n\nWe need to find b, c, d, e such that:\n\n(a^2 + b a + c)(a^2 + d a + e) = a^4 + (b + d) a^3 + (bd + c + e) a^2 + (be + cd) a + c e.\n\nCompare this to our numerator: a^4 + 2a^3 + 0 a^2 +8a +16.\n\nSo we have the following equations:\n\n1. b + d = 2.\n\n2. b d + c + e = 0.\n\n3. b e + c d =8.\n\n4. c e =16.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit involved, but let's try possible integer factors for equation 4: c e=16.\n\nPossible pairs for (c,e) are (1,16), (2,8), (4,4), (-1,-16), etc. Let's try positive integers first.\n\nLet's try c=4 and e=4.\n\nThen equation 4 is 4*4=16, which works.\n\nEquation 3: b*4 +4*d=8 \u21924b +4d=8 \u2192b +d=2. Wait, but equation 1 is b +d=2. So that's consistent.\n\nFrom equation 2: b*d +4 +4 =0 \u2192b d= -8.\n\nBut from equation 1, b +d=2, and b d =-8.\n\nSo the possible solutions for b and d are roots of the equation x^2 -2x -8=0. The roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +32)] /2 \u2192 [2 \u00b1 sqrt(36)]/2 \u2192 [2 \u00b16]/2 \u2192 (8/2)=4, or (-4/2)=-2.\n\nSo b=4, d=-2 or b=-2, d=4.\n\nLet me check if that works.\n\nCase 1: b=4, d=-2.\n\nThen equation 3:4*4 +4*(-2)= 16-8=8. Correct.\n\nSo then the numerator factors into (a\u00b2 +4a +4)(a\u00b2 -2a +4).\n\nWait, let's check that.\n\n(a\u00b2 +4a +4)(a\u00b2 -2a +4) = a^4 +4a^3 +4a\u00b2 -2a^3 -8a\u00b2 -16a +4a\u00b2 +16a +16.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na^4 + (4a^3 -2a^3) + (4a\u00b2 -8a\u00b2 +4a\u00b2) + (-16a +16a) +16.\n\nWhich simplifies to a^4 +2a^3 +0a\u00b2 +0a +16, which matches our numerator.\n\nSo the numerator is (a\u00b2 +4a +4)(a\u00b2 -2a +4). \n\nNow, a\u00b2 +4a +4 is (a+2)^2, so the numerator becomes (a+2)^2 (a\u00b2 -2a +4).\n\nSo, putting it all together, x is:\n\nx = [ (a+2)^2 (a\u00b2 -2a +4) ] / (a+2)^2.\n\nWait, because the denominator is (a +2)^2. So when we divide, the (a+2)^2 terms cancel out, assuming a \u2260-2, which is fine because a is sqrt(n) and n is positive.\n\nSo x simplifies to a\u00b2 -2a +4.\n\nBut a is sqrt(n), so a\u00b2 is n. So x = n - 2a +4.\n\nWhich is x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nHmm, that's a much simpler expression. So x = (n +4) - 2\u221an.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write that as x = (\u221an -1)^2 + 3, but maybe that's not necessary.\n\nSo, now we have x = n +4 -2\u221an.\n\nNow, our task is to find the range of x given that n is between 36 and 72.\n\nSo, 36 \u2264 n \u226472.\n\nLet me find the possible values of x as n varies in this interval.\n\nLet me denote t = \u221an. Since n is between 36 and72, t is between 6 and approximately 8.485 (since 8.485\u00b2 is around 72).\n\nSo t \u2208 [6, sqrt(72)].\n\nsqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485.\n\nSo, x = n +4 -2t.\n\nBut n = t\u00b2, so x = t\u00b2 +4 -2t.\n\nWhich can be written as x = t\u00b2 - 2t +4.\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic in t. Let's analyze this quadratic.\n\nThe quadratic is x(t) = t\u00b2 - 2t +4.\n\nWe can find its minimum and maximum over the interval t \u2208 [6, ~8.485].\n\nThe quadratic function x(t) is a parabola opening upwards, since the coefficient of t\u00b2 is positive. The vertex occurs at t = -b/(2a) = 2/(2*1) =1. So the minimum value is at t=1, but our interval is t from 6 to 8.485, so the function is increasing in this interval since the vertex is at t=1, which is to the left of our interval.\n\nWait, because the parabola opens upwards, and the vertex is at t=1, which is the minimum point. So for t >1, the function is increasing.\n\nSince our t starts at 6, which is greater than 1, the function x(t) is increasing as t increases from 6 to 8.485.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of x occurs at t=6, and the maximum at t=8.485.\n\nSo let's compute x at t=6 and t=8.485.\n\nAt t=6: x = 6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 =36 -12 +4=28.\n\nAt t=8.485: Let me compute t=8.485. Let me compute t\u00b2: 8.485\u00b2 is approximately 72, so t\u00b2=72.\n\nSo x=72 -2*(8.485) +4.\n\nLet me compute that: 72 +4 =76. 2*8.485=16.97.\n\nSo 76 -16.97=59.03.\n\nWait, that's approximately 59.03.\n\nWait, but wait, let me compute t= sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)\u22488.485281374.\n\nSo x(t) = (6\u221a2)^2 - 2*(6\u221a2) +4 =72 -12\u221a2 +4=76 -12\u221a2.\n\nSince sqrt(2)\u22481.41421356, 12*1.41421356\u224816.9705827.\n\nSo 76 -16.9705827\u224859.0294173.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nSo, the possible x values are between 28 and about 59.03.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption D is 28 < x <60.\n\nWhich matches, because 28 is included at the lower end, but our x starts at 28. Wait, when t=6, x=28 exactly. Since n starts at 36, which is t=6, x=28 is the minimum.\n\nWait, but in the question, n is such that 36 \u2264n \u226472. So n=36 is allowed, and so t=6 is allowed.\n\nSo x can be equal to 28 when n=36.\n\nSimilarly, when n=72, x\u224859.03, which is less than 60.\n\nSo the interval for x is [28, ~59.03]. So the options are:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 28 is higher than 20, but 59 is higher than 54. So A is not correct.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 28 is higher than 23, but 59 is higher than 58, so B is not correct.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 28 is higher than 25, 59 is less than 64. So x is between 28 and 59.03, which is within 25 and 64. So C includes the entire x range, but the lower bound is 28, which is higher than 25. So C would allow x to be 25, which is not possible. So C's lower bound is too low.\n\nWait, but wait. The x minimum is 28, so any option that includes values below 28 isn't correct. So option C's lower bound is 25, which is lower than 28. So x can't be between 25 and 28. So option C is not correct.\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60. Well, when n=36, x=28. So x can be equal to 28. So the correct interval should include 28. But option D says x is greater than 28, not greater than or equal. So for n=36, x=28, which is exactly the lower limit. So the correct interval would be 28 \u2264x <60.\n\nBut none of the options have 28 included. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)20 < x <54 \u2192 no, since x can be up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 x can go up to ~59, so no.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 x can be as low as 28, so 25 is too low. So this option would include x=28, but also includes lower values which x doesn't reach. So it's not accurate.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 So x must be greater than 28 and less than 60. But when n=36, x=28, which is exactly the lower limit. So this option excludes x=28, which is allowed. So D isn't correct.\n\nE)None of these.\n\nHmm, so the correct range is 28 \u2264x <60. But none of the options A-D include 28 as the lower bound. So the correct answer would be E) None of these.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. When n=36, x=28, so x can be 28. So the interval is [28, ~59.03). So the options don't include this exactly. Option D says x is greater than 28, which would exclude x=28, but that's part of the possible values. So the correct interval isn't captured by any of the options A-D. Hence, the answer is E.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the given expression for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Expression\nLet \\( a = \\sqrt{n} \\), so \\( n = a^2 \\). Substituting \\( a \\) into the expression:\n\n- **Numerator**:  \n  \\[\n  n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 = a^4 + 2a(a^2 + 4) + 16 = a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a + 16\n  \\]\n\n- **Denominator**:  \n  \\[\n  n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4 = a^2 + 4a + 4 = (a + 2)^2\n  \\]\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a + 16}{(a + 2)^2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Further Simplification\nThe numerator \\( a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a + 16 \\) can be factored as:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 2a^3 + 8a + 16 = (a^2 + 4a + 4)(a^2 - 2a + 4)\n\\]\n\nThe denominator is \\( (a + 2)^2 \\), so:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(a^2 + 4a + 4)(a^2 - 2a + 4)}{(a + 2)^2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( a^2 + 4a + 4 = (a + 2)^2 \\), the \\( (a + 2)^2 \\) terms cancel out:\n\n\\[\nx = a^2 - 2a + 4\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( a = \\sqrt{n} \\):\n\n\\[\nx = n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Range of \\( x \\)\nGiven \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\), let \\( t = \\sqrt{n} \\). Then \\( t \\in [6, \\sqrt{72}] \\), where \\( \\sqrt{72} \\approx 8.485 \\). The expression for \\( x \\) becomes:\n\n\\[\nx = t^2 - 2t + 4\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic function in \\( t \\), opening upwards, with its vertex at \\( t = 1 \\). Since \\( t \\in [6, 8.485] \\), the function is increasing in this interval. Therefore:\n\n- At \\( t = 6 \\):  \n  \\[\n  x = 6^2 - 2(6) + 4 = 36 - 12 + 4 = 28\n  \\]\n\n- At \\( t \\approx 8.485 \\):  \n  \\[\n  x \\approx (8.485)^2 - 2(8.485) + 4 = 72 - 16.97 + 4 \\approx 59.03\n  \\]\n\nThus, \\( x \\) ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Options\n- **Option A: \\( 20 < x < 54 \\)**  \n  Incorrect, as \\( x \\) can exceed 54 (up to ~59.03).\n\n- **Option B: \\( 23 < x < 58 \\)**  \n  Incorrect, as \\( x \\) can exceed 58 (up to ~59.03).\n\n- **Option C: \\( 25 < x < 64 \\)**  \n  Incorrect, as \\( x \\) does not go below 28.\n\n- **Option D: \\( 28 < x < 60 \\)**  \n  Incorrect, as \\( x = 28 \\) is included in the range, but this option excludes it.\n\n- **Option E: None of these**  \n  Correct, as none of the options accurately describe the range \\( 28 \\leq x < 60 \\).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct interval for \\( x \\) is \\( 28 \\leq x < 60 \\), which is not fully captured by any of the given options.\n\n**Answer: E**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this algebra problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: If n is such that 36 \u2264 n \u2264 72, then x equals (n squared plus 2 times the square root of n times (n + 4) plus 16) divided by (n plus 4 times the square root of n plus 4). And the question is about which interval x falls into, with options given as A to E.\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it. I remember from algebra that sometimes you can factor expressions to make them easier to handle. Let me write down the expression for x:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) + 16] / [n + 4\u221an +4]\n\nWait, the numerator and denominator both have similar terms. Let me see if I can factor them. The numerator looks like a quadratic in terms of something. Oh, maybe if I let a = \u221an, then maybe I can rewrite the expression in terms of a and see if it simplifies.\n\nSo let me substitute a = \u221an. Then n = a\u00b2. Let's try that substitution.\n\nNumerator becomes: (a\u00b2)\u00b2 + 2 * a * (a\u00b2 +4) + 16.\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute each part. (a\u00b2)\u00b2 is a^4. Then the next term is 2 * a * (a\u00b2 +4). Let me expand that: 2a^3 + 8a. So the numerator is a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Let me look at the denominator. It becomes a\u00b2 + 4a +4. Wait, that's a perfect square. Because a\u00b2 +4a +4 is (a + 2)^2. Oh, right! So denominator is (a + 2)^2.\n\nNow the numerator is a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16. Hmm, maybe I can factor that. Let me try grouping terms. Let's see, a^4 + 2a^3 and 8a +16. So a^3(a + 2) and 8(a +2). Oh wait, so both terms have a (a +2) factor. So the numerator factors as (a + 2)(a^3 + 8).\n\nWait, a^3 +8 is a sum of cubes, right? Because a^3 + 2^3. The formula for sum of cubes is (a + b)(a\u00b2 - ab + b\u00b2). So a^3 +8 = (a + 2)(a\u00b2 - 2a +4).\n\nSo putting it all together, the numerator is (a +2)(a +2)(a\u00b2 -2a +4) because the denominator is (a +2)^2. Wait, no, denominator is (a+2)^2, and the numerator is (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2 - 2a +4). Because the numerator factors into (a+2)(a+2)(a\u00b2-2a+4), which is (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2 - 2a +4).\n\nSo the x expression becomes:\n\nx = [ (a+2)^2 (a\u00b2 - 2a +4) ] / [ (a + 2)^2 ]\n\nOh, the (a+2)^2 cancels out top and bottom. So x simplifies to a\u00b2 - 2a +4.\n\nBut wait, a is \u221an. So a\u00b2 is (\u221an)^2 = n. So substituting back, x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, that's much simpler. So x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nNow, the problem states that n is between 36 and 72, inclusive. So I need to find the possible values of x given this range of n.\n\nSo let's compute x for n=36 and n=72.\n\nFirst, n=36: x = 36 - 2*sqrt(36) +4.\n\nsqrt(36) is 6. So 36 - 2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nWait, that's 36-12 is 24, plus 4 is 28. So x=28 when n=36.\n\nNow for n=72: x=72 -2*sqrt(72) +4.\n\nsqrt(72) is equal to sqrt(36*2) =6*sqrt(2), which is approximately 6*1.4142 = about 8.4852.\n\nSo 72 - 2*8.4852 +4. Let's compute that step by step.\n\n2*8.4852 is 16.9704. So 72 - 16.9704 is 55.0296. Then add 4: 55.0296 +4 = 59.0296.\n\nSo x is approximately 59.03 when n=72.\n\nWait, but wait. So when n is 36, x is 28, and when n is 72, x is approximately 59. So x ranges from 28 to around 59. Let me see the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 20 < x <54 \u2192 no, because 59 is higher than 54.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 28 is greater than 23, and 59 is just over 58. So 59 is outside this upper bound.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 28 is above 25, 59 is below 64. So this would include x values from 28 to 59.\n\nWait, but wait: when n=36, x is 28, and when n=72, x is about 59. So x can go up to 59 and a bit. So the maximum x is about 59.03, which is just over 59.\n\nSo the x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D is 28 < x <60. Because 28 is the lower bound when n=36, but wait, wait, let me check for n=36. When n=36, x=28. So the x is equal to 28 at that point. So the interval would be x \u226528 and x \u2264 about 59.\n\nWait, but the options are given as open intervals, not inclusive. So for option D, it's 28 < x <60. So when x is 28, it's not included. But n=36 gives x=28, which is the lower limit of the interval. So x can be exactly 28, but the option D says x must be greater than 28. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me think: is x=28 included in any of the options? Let me check each option.\n\nOption A: 20<x<54 \u2192 28 is included (since 28>20 and 28<54), but the upper limit for x is about 59, so no, because x can be up to 59, which is beyond 54.\n\nOption B:23<x<58 \u2192 28 is included, but x can go up to 59, which is above 58, so this option would exclude x beyond 58.\n\nOption C:25<x<64 \u2192 28 is included, and 59 is within 64. So x can be up to about 59, which is less than 64, so this option would include the entire range.\n\nOption D:28<x<60 \u2192 28 is not included, but x can be 28, so this option would exclude x=28. But when n=36, x=28, so the interval would include x=28, but option D doesn't include it. So this option might not be correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me double-check the x when n=36. So x=36 -2*sqrt(36) +4. sqrt(36)=6, so 2*6=12. 36-12=24, 24+4=28. Correct.\n\nSo when n=36, x=28. So the possible x starts at 28 and goes up to approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C:25<x<64 \u2192 28 is within this range, and 59.03 is less than 64. So this option includes all x values from 28 to 59.03. So x is between 25 and 64. But wait, but when n=36, x is exactly 28, which is greater than 25. So the lower bound of option C is 25, which is less than 28, so the actual x starts at 28, which is within the 25 to 64 range.\n\nSo option C would include x from 28 to 59.03, which fits within 25<x<64. So the correct interval would be within option C.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options again:\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 x is between 25 and 64. So since our x starts at 28, which is above 25, and goes up to about 59, which is below 64, this is correct.\n\nWait, but what about the other options? Option D is 28 <x <60. So x=28 is not included. But in our case, x can be 28, so D would exclude that point. So the correct interval must include 28. So option C is correct because it includes x from 25 to 64, which covers 28 to 59.03.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me check for n=36, x=28. So 28 is the minimum x value? What about for n between 36 and 72, does x increase as n increases? Let me check for a higher n, say n=49.\n\nn=49: x=49 -2*sqrt(49) +4 = 49 -2*7 +4=49-14+4=39.\n\nn=64: x=64 -2*8 +4=64-16+4=52.\n\nn=72: as before, approx 59.03.\n\nSo x increases as n increases. So x starts at 28 (n=36) and goes up to about 59 when n=72.\n\nSo the x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking again at the options:\n\nOption C:25<x<64 \u2192 includes 28 to 59.\n\nOption D:28<x<60 \u2192 includes x from just above 28 up to 60, but our x starts at exactly 28.\n\nWait, but in the options, the intervals are open, not including the endpoints. So for option C, x can be as low as just above 25, but in reality, the minimum x is 28. So 25 is lower than the actual minimum, which is 28. So option C's lower limit is lower than the actual minimum.\n\nBut since 28 is within option C's range (25 < x <64), the x values are all within option C. So the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure that x is always greater than 28. Let's take n=36, x=28. What about n=37?\n\nn=37: x=37 -2*sqrt(37) +4. sqrt(37) is about 6.082. So 2*6.082=12.164. 37 -12.164=24.836 +4=28.836. So x=28.836, which is greater than 28.\n\nSo x increases as n increases beyond 36. So the minimum x is 28, and maximum is about 59.03.\n\nSo the interval for x is [28, 59.03). But the options are open intervals.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 No, because x can go up to 59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 x can be up to 59.03, which is beyond 58.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, because 28 is within 25 and 64, and 59.03 is within 64.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 no, because x can be exactly 28, so this interval doesn't include 28.\n\nE)None of these.\n\nWait, but option C is 25 <x <64. Our x starts at 28, which is above 25. So x is always greater than 25 and less than 64. So option C would include all possible x values. So the correct answer should be C.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought option D might be a possibility. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60. Since x can be exactly 28 when n=36, this option doesn't include x=28. So it's possible that x=28 is allowed, so the correct interval must include 28.\n\nSo between options C and D, only option C includes x=28, as it's 25 <x <64.\n\nWait, but wait. Another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in simplifying x. Let me double-check the algebra.\n\nOriginal x: [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nI let a=\u221an, so n=a\u00b2. So numerator becomes a^4 + 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nWhich is a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16.\n\nDenominator is a\u00b2 +4a +4 = (a+2)^2.\n\nThen I factored numerator as (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2 - 2a +4). How?\n\nWait, wait: numerator is a^4 +2a^3 +8a +16.\n\nLet me try to factor this. Let me group terms: (a^4 + 2a^3) + (8a +16). Factor a^3 from first two terms: a^3(a + 2) + 8(a +2). So (a +2)(a^3 +8).\n\nYes, and a^3 +8 is (a +2)(a\u00b2 - 2a +4). So numerator is (a +2)(a +2)(a\u00b2 - 2a +4) = (a+2)^2 (a\u00b2 -2a +4). So when I divide by denominator (a+2)^2, I get x = a\u00b2 -2a +4.\n\nWhich is x = (\u221an)^2 - 2\u221an +4 = n -2\u221an +4. Correct.\n\nSo the earlier steps are correct.\n\nThus, x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nNow, since n is between 36 and 72, let's find the range of x.\n\nWe have x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nLet me compute the derivative to see if x is increasing or decreasing, but perhaps that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, since n increases, and \u221an increases, but let me think about the function.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to just compute x at the endpoints.\n\nAt n=36: x=36 -2*6 +4=36-12+4=28.\n\nAt n=72: x=72 -2*sqrt(72)+4.\n\nsqrt(72) = 6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485.\n\nSo 2*8.485\u224816.97.\n\n72-16.97=55.03; 55.03+4=59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nSo x is between 28 and 59.03.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 no, because x can be up to 59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 x can be up to 59.03, so this is beyond 58.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 28 is within 25 to 64, and 59.03 is less than 64. So this is correct.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 x can be as low as 28, which is the minimum. But since the interval is open, 28 is not included, which means x can't be 28. But when n=36, x is exactly 28. So this option would exclude that point, making it incorrect.\n\nE) None of these \u2192 only if none of the options fit, but option C includes the entire range.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again: when n increases from 36 to 72, x increases from 28 to 59.03. So x is always greater than or equal to 28 and less than 60. So the interval for x is [28, ~59.03). So which option correctly describes this interval?\n\nOption C is 25 <x <64 \u2192 includes all x from 28 to 59.03.\n\nOption D is 28 <x <60 \u2192 includes x from just above 28 to 60, but our x can reach 59.03, which is less than 60, so this would be acceptable except that x can be exactly 28, which option D doesn't include. But the question is whether x can be exactly 28. Since n=36 is allowed, x=28 is part of the solution.\n\nSo for option D, x must be greater than 28, but x can be 28, so option D is incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct option is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this algebra problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: If n is such that 36 \u2264 n \u2264 72, then x equals (n squared plus 2 times the square root of n times (n + 4) plus 16) divided by (n plus 4 times the square root of n plus 4). And the question is about which interval x falls into, with options given as A to E.\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it. I remember from algebra that sometimes you can factor expressions to make them easier to handle. Let me write down the expression for x:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) + 16] / [n + 4\u221an +4]\n\nWait, the numerator and denominator both have similar terms. Let me see if I can factor them. The numerator looks like a quadratic in terms of something. Oh, maybe if I let a = \u221an, then maybe I can rewrite the expression in terms of a and see if it simplifies.\n\nSo let me substitute a = \u221an. Then n = a\u00b2. Let's try that substitution.\n\nNumerator becomes: (a\u00b2)\u00b2 + 2 * a * (a\u00b2 +4) + 16.\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute each part. (a\u00b2)\u00b2 is a^4. Then the next term is 2 * a * (a\u00b2 +4). Let me expand that: 2a^3 + 8a. So the numerator is a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Let me look at the denominator. It becomes a\u00b2 + 4a +4. Wait, that's a perfect square. Because a\u00b2 +4a +4 is (a + 2)^2. Oh, right! So denominator is (a + 2)^2.\n\nNow the numerator is a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16. Hmm, maybe I can factor that. Let me try grouping terms. Let's see, a^4 + 2a^3 and 8a +16. So a^3(a + 2) and 8(a +2). Oh wait, so both terms have a (a +2) factor. So the numerator factors as (a + 2)(a^3 + 8).\n\nWait, a^3 +8 is a sum of cubes, right? Because a^3 + 2^3. The formula for sum of cubes is (a + b)(a\u00b2 - ab + b\u00b2). So a^3 +8 = (a + 2)(a\u00b2 - 2a +4).\n\nSo putting it all together, the numerator is (a +2)(a +2)(a\u00b2 -2a +4) because the denominator is (a +2)^2. Wait, no, denominator is (a+2)^2, and the numerator is (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2 - 2a +4). Because the numerator factors into (a+2)(a+2)(a\u00b2-2a+4), which is (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2 - 2a +4).\n\nSo the x expression becomes:\n\nx = [ (a+2)^2 (a\u00b2 - 2a +4) ] / [ (a + 2)^2 ]\n\nOh, the (a+2)^2 cancels out top and bottom. So x simplifies to a\u00b2 - 2a +4.\n\nBut wait, a is \u221an. So a\u00b2 is (\u221an)^2 = n. So substituting back, x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, that's much simpler. So x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nNow, the problem states that n is between 36 and 72, inclusive. So I need to find the possible values of x given this range of n.\n\nSo let's compute x for n=36 and n=72.\n\nFirst, n=36: x = 36 - 2*sqrt(36) +4.\n\nsqrt(36) is 6. So 36 - 2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nWait, that's 36-12 is 24, plus 4 is 28. So x=28 when n=36.\n\nNow for n=72: x=72 -2*sqrt(72) +4.\n\nsqrt(72) is equal to sqrt(36*2) =6*sqrt(2), which is approximately 6*1.4142 = about 8.4852.\n\nSo 72 - 2*8.4852 +4. Let's compute that step by step.\n\n2*8.4852 is 16.9704. So 72 - 16.9704 is 55.0296. Then add 4: 55.0296 +4 = 59.0296.\n\nSo x is approximately 59.03 when n=72.\n\nWait, but wait. So when n is 36, x is 28, and when n is 72, x is approximately 59. So x ranges from 28 to around 59. Let me see the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 20 < x <54 \u2192 no, because 59 is higher than 54.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 28 is greater than 23, and 59 is just over 58. So 59 is outside this upper bound.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 28 is above 25, 59 is below 64. So this would include x values from 28 to 59.\n\nWait, but wait: when n=36, x is 28, and when n=72, x is about 59. So x can go up to 59 and a bit. So the maximum x is about 59.03, which is just over 59.\n\nSo the x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D is 28 < x <60. Because 28 is the lower bound when n=36, but wait, wait, let me check for n=36. When n=36, x=28. So the x is equal to 28 at that point. So the interval would be x \u226528 and x \u2264 about 59.\n\nWait, but the options are given as open intervals, not inclusive. So for option D, it's 28 < x <60. So when x is 28, it's not included. But n=36 gives x=28, which is the lower limit of the interval. So x can be exactly 28, but the option D says x must be greater than 28. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me think: is x=28 included in any of the options? Let me check each option.\n\nOption A: 20<x<54 \u2192 28 is included (since 28>20 and 28<54), but the upper limit for x is about 59, so no, because x can be up to 59, which is beyond 54.\n\nOption B:23<x<58 \u2192 28 is included, but x can go up to 59, which is above 58, so this option would exclude x beyond 58.\n\nOption C:25<x<64 \u2192 28 is included, and 59 is within 64. So x can be up to about 59, which is less than 64, so this option would include the entire range.\n\nOption D:28<x<60 \u2192 28 is not included, but x can be 28, so this option would exclude x=28. But when n=36, x=28, so the interval would include x=28, but option D doesn't include it. So this option might not be correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me double-check the x when n=36. So x=36 -2*sqrt(36) +4. sqrt(36)=6, so 2*6=12. 36-12=24, 24+4=28. Correct.\n\nSo when n=36, x=28. So the possible x starts at 28 and goes up to approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C:25<x<64 \u2192 28 is within this range, and 59.03 is less than 64. So this option includes all x values from 28 to 59.03. So x is between 25 and 64. But wait, but when n=36, x is exactly 28, which is greater than 25. So the lower bound of option C is 25, which is less than 28, so the actual x starts at 28, which is within the 25 to 64 range.\n\nSo option C would include x from 28 to 59.03, which fits within 25<x<64. So the correct interval would be within option C.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options again:\n\nOption C:25 <x <64 \u2192 x is between 25 and 64. So since our x starts at 28, which is above 25, and goes up to about 59, which is below 64, this is correct.\n\nWait, but what about the other options? Option D is 28 <x <60. So x=28 is not included. But in our case, x can be 28, so D would exclude that point. So the correct interval must include 28. So option C is correct because it includes x from 25 to 64, which covers 28 to 59.03.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me check for n=36, x=28. So 28 is the minimum x value? What about for n between 36 and 72, does x increase as n increases? Let me check for a higher n, say n=49.\n\nn=49: x=49 -2*sqrt(49) +4 = 49 -2*7 +4=49-14+4=39.\n\nn=64: x=64 -2*8 +4=64-16+4=52.\n\nn=72: as before, approx 59.03.\n\nSo x increases as n increases. So x starts at 28 (n=36) and goes up to about 59 when n=72.\n\nSo the x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nLooking again at the options:\n\nOption C:25<x<64 \u2192 includes 28 to 59.\n\nOption D:28<x<60 \u2192 includes x from just above 28 up to 60, but our x starts at exactly 28.\n\nWait, but in the options, the intervals are open, not including the endpoints. So for option C, x can be as low as just above 25, but in reality, the minimum x is 28. So 25 is lower than the actual minimum, which is 28. So option C's lower limit is lower than the actual minimum.\n\nBut since 28 is within option C's range (25 < x <64), the x values are all within option C. So the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure that x is always greater than 28. Let's take n=36, x=28. What about n=37?\n\nn=37: x=37 -2*sqrt(37) +4. sqrt(37) is about 6.082. So 2*6.082=12.164. 37 -12.164=24.836 +4=28.836. So x=28.836, which is greater than 28.\n\nSo x increases as n increases beyond 36. So the minimum x is 28, and maximum is about 59.03.\n\nSo the interval for x is [28, 59.03). But the options are open intervals.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 No, because x can go up to 59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 x can be up to 59.03, which is beyond 58.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, because 28 is within 25 and 64, and 59.03 is within 64.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 no, because x can be exactly 28, so this interval doesn't include 28.\n\nE)None of these.\n\nWait, but option C is 25 <x <64. Our x starts at 28, which is above 25. So x is always greater than 25 and less than 64. So option C would include all possible x values. So the correct answer should be C.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought option D might be a possibility. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60. Since x can be exactly 28 when n=36, this option doesn't include x=28. So it's possible that x=28 is allowed, so the correct interval must include 28.\n\nSo between options C and D, only option C includes x=28, as it's 25 <x <64.\n\nWait, but wait. Another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in simplifying x. Let me double-check the algebra.\n\nOriginal x: [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nI let a=\u221an, so n=a\u00b2. So numerator becomes a^4 + 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nWhich is a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16.\n\nDenominator is a\u00b2 +4a +4 = (a+2)^2.\n\nThen I factored numerator as (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2 - 2a +4). How?\n\nWait, wait: numerator is a^4 +2a^3 +8a +16.\n\nLet me try to factor this. Let me group terms: (a^4 + 2a^3) + (8a +16). Factor a^3 from first two terms: a^3(a + 2) + 8(a +2). So (a +2)(a^3 +8).\n\nYes, and a^3 +8 is (a +2)(a\u00b2 - 2a +4). So numerator is (a +2)(a +2)(a\u00b2 - 2a +4) = (a+2)^2 (a\u00b2 -2a +4). So when I divide by denominator (a+2)^2, I get x = a\u00b2 -2a +4.\n\nWhich is x = (\u221an)^2 - 2\u221an +4 = n -2\u221an +4. Correct.\n\nSo the earlier steps are correct.\n\nThus, x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nNow, since n is between 36 and 72, let's find the range of x.\n\nWe have x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nLet me compute the derivative to see if x is increasing or decreasing, but perhaps that's overcomplicating.

Substituting into the numerator and denominator:\n\n- **Numerator**: \\( n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n(n + 4)} + 16 \\) becomes \\( a^4 + 2a(a^2 + 4) + 16 = a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a + 16 \\).\n- **Denominator**: \\( n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4 \\) becomes \\( a^2 + 4a + 4 = (a + 2)^2 \\).\n\nFactoring the numerator:\n\\[\na^4 + 2a^3 + 8a + 16 = (a + 2)^2(a^2 - 2a + 4).\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(a + 2)^2(a^2 - 2a + 4)}{(a + 2)^2} = a^2 - 2a + 4.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back \\( a = \\sqrt{n} \\), we get:\n\\[\nx = n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Range of \\( x \\)\nGiven \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\), we calculate \\( x \\) at the endpoints:\n\n1. **At \\( n = 36 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = 36 - 2\\sqrt{36} + 4 = 36 - 12 + 4 = 28.\n   \\]\n\n2. **At \\( n = 72 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = 72 - 2\\sqrt{72} + 4.\n   \\]\n   Since \\( \\sqrt{72} = 6\\sqrt{2} \\approx 8.485 \\), we find:\n   \\[\n   x \\approx 72 - 2(8.485) + 4 = 72 - 16.97 + 4 = 59.03.\n   \\]\n\nThus, \\( x \\) ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Options\nThe options are:\n- **A)** \\( 20 < x < 54 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x \\) can exceed 54.\n- **B)** \\( 23 < x < 58 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x \\) can exceed 58.\n- **C)** \\( 25 < x < 64 \\): Correct, as \\( x \\) ranges from 28 to 59.03, which is entirely within this interval.\n- **D)** \\( 28 < x < 60 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x \\) can equal 28, which is excluded by this interval.\n- **E)** None of these: Incorrect, as option C is valid.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct interval for \\( x \\) is \\( 25 < x < 64 \\).\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the answer. Let's take it step by step.\n\nThe question says that n is between 36 and 72, inclusive. Then there's this expression for x: (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16) divided by (n + 4\u221an + 4). And we have to find which interval x falls into.\n\nHmm. The options are A to E, with E being none of these. I need to simplify this expression for x, maybe factor it or find a way to express it more simply so that I can find its range.\n\nLooking at the numerator and denominator, I notice that both have terms with n and \u221an. Maybe there's a way to factor or rewrite the expression. Let me write out the numerator and denominator separately.\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16.\n\nWait, that looks a bit like a perfect square. Let me think. The form (a + b)^2 is a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. So if I can write the numerator as something squared, that might help.\n\nLooking at the numerator terms:\n\nn\u00b2 is a square of n. 16 is 4 squared. The middle term is 2 * something * something else.\n\nSo, 2\u221an(n +4) can be written as 2 * \u221an * (n +4). Let me see if that fits into the perfect square formula.\n\nSuppose the numerator is (n + something)^2. Let me see:\n\nLet me think of it as (n + a\u221an + b)^2. Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator is (\u221an + c)^2 or something else.\n\nWait, let's try to see:\n\nSuppose the numerator is (something + something else)^2. Let me try to find two terms that when squared would give me the numerator.\n\nLooking at the first term, n\u00b2, which is (\u221an)^4, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator is (\u221an + something)^4? No, that might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps the numerator is (\u221an + d)^2 multiplied by something. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Let me expand 2\u221an(n+4) to see what it is.\n\n2\u221an(n +4) = 2n\u221an + 8\u221an.\n\nSo numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an + 16.\n\nHmm, can I group terms here? Maybe group n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an together, and then the rest.\n\nn\u00b2 + 2n\u221an is equal to (n + \u221an)^2 minus something? Wait, (n + \u221an)^2 is n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + n. So no, that's not matching. So perhaps not that approach.\n\nWait, what about the entire numerator? Let me try to see if it's a square of a binomial. Let me think: Let me see if I can write the numerator as (\u221an * something + something else)^2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator can be written as (n + a)^2 + something, but not sure.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me look at the denominator as well.\n\nDenominator: n +4\u221an +4. Let me factor this. Hmm, perhaps it's (\u221an + something)^2.\n\nLet me see: (\u221an + 2)^2 = (\u221an)^2 + 4\u221an +4 = n +4\u221an +4. Oh! That's exactly the denominator. So denominator is (\u221an + 2)^2.\n\nSo denominator is squared, which is good. Now, what about the numerator? Let me see if it can be expressed as a square as well.\n\nNumerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let me try to see if this is a square of something.\n\nWait, let me think of it as (n + something)^2.\n\nLet me suppose that the numerator is (n + a\u221an + b)^2.\n\nExpanding that: n\u00b2 + 2a n\u221an + (a\u00b2 n) + 2b n + 2ab\u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nHmm, but the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let me write that again:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2n\u221an +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo if I compare the two expressions:\n\nFrom numerator expansion:\nn\u00b2 + [2a n\u221an + 2b n] + [a\u00b2 n + 2ab\u221an + b\u00b2].\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe a different approach. Let me try to see if the numerator is (n + something)^2 plus something else.\n\nWait, n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an is part of the numerator. Let me consider that part: n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an = (\u221an)^4 + 2 (\u221an)^3. Hmm, perhaps not helpful.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me factor the numerator in terms of the denominator.\n\nWait, denominator is (\u221an + 2)^2. Let me see if numerator can be written as (something)(denominator) plus something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator is (n + 4\u221an +4) multiplied by something else. Wait, let me try dividing.\n\nWait, perhaps the numerator is (n + 4\u221an +4) multiplied by (n + something). Let me try.\n\nWait, the denominator is (\u221an + 2)^2. Let me see if numerator is (n + 4\u221an +4)(something) plus something.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to factor numerator.\n\nWait, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nLet me write that as n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, I can group n\u00b2 +2n\u221an and 8\u221an +16.\n\nn\u00b2 +2n\u221an = n(n + 2\u221an) = n(\u221an + 2)^2 - 4n? Wait, because (\u221an + 2)^2 is n +4\u221an +4. So n(\u221an +2)^2 = n^2 +4n\u221an +4n. Hmm, but that's more than the term we have.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the numerator as (n + a)^2 + something.\n\nWait, let me think of the numerator as n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + (\u221an)^2 + 8\u221an +16 - (\u221an)^2.\n\nWait, that would be (n + \u221an)^2 + 8\u221an +16 - n.\n\nWait, that's getting messy. Maybe not the right path.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the numerator as (n + 4\u221an +4) multiplied by (n + something else).\n\nLet me try to perform polynomial division, treating n and \u221an as variables.\n\nWait, maybe let me set m = \u221an. Since n is between 36 and 72, m is between 6 and 8\u221a(something) wait, n is 36 to 72. So m is \u221a36=6, and \u221a72 is approximately 8.485. So m ranges from 6 to about 8.485.\n\nSo, substituting m = \u221an, then n = m\u00b2. Let's rewrite the expression for x in terms of m.\n\nNumerator becomes: (m\u00b2)^2 + 2m (m\u00b2 +4) +16 = m^4 + 2m^3 + 8m +16.\n\nDenominator becomes: m\u00b2 +4m +4 = (m+2)^2.\n\nSo x = [m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16] / (m+2)^2.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor the numerator.\n\nLooking at numerator: m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16.\n\nHmm, let me try to factor by grouping.\n\nGroup terms as (m^4 + 2m^3) + (8m +16).\n\nFactor m^3 from first group: m^3(m +2) + 8(m +2).\n\nSo, (m^3 +8)(m +2).\n\nWait, wait! Because m^3 +8 can be factored further as (m +2)(m\u00b2 - 2m +4). So overall, numerator is (m +2)(m\u00b2 - 2m +4) (m +2).\n\nSo numerator is (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 - 2m +4).\n\nDenominator is (m+2)^2.\n\nSo when we divide numerator by denominator, the (m+2)^2 terms cancel out, leaving x = m\u00b2 - 2m +4.\n\nWow, that's a big simplification!\n\nSo x = m\u00b2 - 2m +4.\n\nSince m is between 6 and approximately 8.485, let's compute x in terms of m.\n\nSo x = m\u00b2 - 2m +4.\n\nThis is a quadratic in m. Let's see how x behaves as m varies from 6 to ~8.485.\n\nWe can compute x at the endpoints and check the minimum in between.\n\nFirst, compute x when m=6:\n\nx = 6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nThen compute x when m=8.485 (approx sqrt(72)=8.485):\n\nm=8.485:\n\nx = (8.485)^2 -2*(8.485) +4.\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n8.485^2 is approximately 72 (since n is 72, m is sqrt(72)=8.485), but let me compute it more accurately.\n\n8.485^2 = (8 + 0.485)^2 = 64 + 2*8*0.485 + (0.485)^2.\n\n= 64 + 7.76 + ~0.235 \u2248 64 +7.76=71.76 +0.235=71.995 \u224872.\n\nSo x \u224872 - 2*(8.485) +4.\n\n2*8.485 is 16.97.\n\nSo x \u224872 -16.97 +4 = (72+4) -16.97 = 76 -16.97 = 59.03.\n\nSo when m is 8.485, x is approximately 59.03.\n\nWait, but m goes up to 8.485, so x is up to around 59.\n\nWait, but wait, let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, m= sqrt(72)=8.485281374.\n\nSo m^2 =72.\n\nSo x=72 -2*(8.485281374) +4.\n\n2*8.485281374=16.97056275.\n\nSo x=72 +4 -16.97056275 =76 -16.97056275 =59.02943725.\n\nSo approximately 59.03.\n\nSo when m=6, x=28; when m=8.485, x\u224859.03.\n\nBut wait, x is a quadratic function of m: x = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nSince the quadratic is in m, and the coefficient of m\u00b2 is positive, the function is a parabola opening upwards. The vertex is at m = -b/(2a) = 2/(2*1)=1.\n\nBut since m is between 6 and 8.485, which is to the right of the vertex, the function is increasing in this interval. So x increases as m increases.\n\nTherefore, the minimum x is at m=6, which is 28, and maximum at m=8.485, which is approximately 59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to about 59.03.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA) 20 < x <54 \u2192 28 is higher than 20, but 59 is higher than 54, so this interval doesn't cover the entire x range.\n\nB) 23 < x <58 \u2192 28 is higher than 23, and 58 is just below 59, so x could be up to about 59, which is beyond 58. So this interval is up to 58, but x can be 59. So not all x would fit in B.\n\nC) 25 < x <64 \u2192 28 is higher than 25, and 64 is higher than 59. So x would be between 28 and about 59, which is within 25-64. So this option includes all possible x.\n\nWait, but wait, x starts at 28, which is higher than 25, so the lower limit is 28, which is within 25-64. The upper limit is 59, which is less than 64, so the entire x range (28 to 59) is within 25 to 64. So option C is 25 < x <64. So x is between 28 and 59, which is entirely within 25-64. So C would include all possible x.\n\nBut let me check the other options to be sure.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 Well, when m is 6, x=28, so the lower bound is 28, which is the minimum. But 60 is higher than our maximum x of about 59.03. So x could go up to 59, which is just below 60, so x would be less than 60. So option D says x is between 28 and 60. But wait, when m=8.485, x is about 59.03, which is less than 60. So the x range is 28 < x <59.03, which fits within 28 < x <60. So option D says 28 <x <60, which is a correct interval, as our x is between 28 and ~59.\n\nWait, but wait, when m=6, x=28. So at m=6, x=28, which is the lower bound. So x can be equal to 28. But the options are inequalities, like 28 <x <60, which would exclude x=28. But in reality, when m=6, x=28 is included.\n\nSo perhaps the correct interval includes 28, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the answer is E) None of these.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again.\n\nOption D is 28 <x <60. So our x starts at 28, but when m=6, x is exactly 28. So x can be 28. So option D starts at 28, but not including it. So x=28 would not be included in D. But in reality, x can be as low as 28, so the correct interval should include 28 as a possible value. So perhaps none of the options include 28 as a possible value.\n\nWait, but the question says \"satisfies\", so perhaps the correct interval is 28 < x < ~59. So the options given are:\n\nA: 20<x<54 \u2192 doesn't cover the upper end.\n\nB:23<x<58 \u2192 doesn't cover up to 59.\n\nC:25<x<64 \u2192 covers the entire range.\n\nD:28<x<60 \u2192 covers from 28 to 60, but our x starts at 28, so D's lower bound is 28, which is not inclusive. So x can be 28, but D's lower bound is >28, so it doesn't include x=28.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"satisfies\"\u2014so if the actual x can be 28, then any option that doesn't include 28 would be incorrect. So looking at the options:\n\nOption C: 25 < x <64. So 28 is within this range. So x can be as low as 28, which is within 25 and 64. So the entire x range (28 to 59) is within 25 to 64, so option C includes all possible x values.\n\nBut wait, when m=6, x=28. So 28 is included in option C, because 25 < 28 <64. So yes, x=28 is within C's range.\n\nSo the correct interval would be 28 \u2264x <60, but since none of the options have 28 as the lower bound, perhaps the best option is C, which includes all possible x from 28 to 59.\n\nWait, but the options don't have an option that starts at 28. So perhaps the answer is C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The options are:\n\nA)20 < x <54 \u2192 no, because x can be up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 no, because x can be up to ~59.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, because x starts at 28 (which is >25) and goes up to 59 (which is <64). So all x values are within 25 and 64.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 but x can be as low as 28, which is not included in D's lower bound.\n\nSo the correct answer would be C, since 28 is higher than 25, and 59 is less than 64.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So x ranges from 28 to 59. So the options are:\n\nC)25 < x <64 \u2192 yes, because 28 is within 25-64.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 no, because x can be exactly 28, but D starts at >28.\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but another thought: when n=36, m=6, x=28. When n=72, m\u22488.485, x\u224859. So x is between 28 and 59. So looking at the options:\n\nA)20-54: 59 is above, so no.\n\nB)23-58: 59 is above 58, so no.\n\nC)25-64: 28 is within, 59 is within. So yes.\n\nD)28-60: 28 is included? Well, the options are written as 28 <x <60. So x can be 28, but D's lower bound is 28 <x, so x=28 is not included in D.\n\nSo the only option that correctly includes all possible x values is C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the math. Did I make any mistake in simplifying x?\n\nEarlier steps:\n\nExpressed x as (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16)/(n +4\u221an +4).\n\nSubstituted m=\u221an, so n=m\u00b2.\n\nNumerator became m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16.\n\nDenominator became (m+2)^2.\n\nFactored numerator as (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4).\n\nSo x = [ (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4) ] / (m+2)^2 ) = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo x = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nWhich is a quadratic, and with m from 6 to 8.485, x ranges from 28 to ~59.\n\nSo the correct interval is 28 \u2264x <59.03.\n\nLooking at the options, C)25 <x <64 includes this entire range, because 28 is greater than 25, and 59 is less than 64.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n",

The form (a + b)^2 is a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. So if I can write the numerator as something squared, that might help.\n\nLooking at the numerator terms:\n\nn\u00b2 is a square of n. 16 is 4 squared. The middle term is 2 * something * something else.\n\nSo, 2\u221an(n +4) can be written as 2 * \u221an * (n +4). Let me see if that fits into the perfect square formula.\n\nSuppose the numerator is (n + something)^2. Let me see:\n\nLet me think of it as (n + a\u221an + b)^2. Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator is (\u221an + c)^2 or something else.\n\nWait, let's try to see:\n\nSuppose the numerator is (something + something else)^2. Let me try to find two terms that when squared would give me the numerator.\n\nLooking at the first term, n\u00b2, which is (\u221an)^4, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator is (\u221an + something)^4? No, that might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps the numerator is (\u221an + d)^2 multiplied by something. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Let me expand 2\u221an(n+4) to see what it is.\n\n2\u221an(n +4) = 2n\u221an + 8\u221an.\n\nSo numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an + 16.\n\nHmm, can I group terms here? Maybe group n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an together, and then the rest.\n\nn\u00b2 + 2n\u221an is equal to (n + \u221an)^2 minus something? Wait, (n + \u221an)^2 is n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + n. So no, that's not matching. So perhaps not that approach.\n\nWait, what about the entire numerator? Let me try to see if it's a square of a binomial. Let me think: Let me see if I can write the numerator as (\u221an * something + something else)^2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator can be written as (n + a)^2 + something, but not sure.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me look at the denominator as well.\n\nDenominator: n +4\u221an +4. Let me factor this. Hmm, perhaps it's (\u221an + something)^2.\n\nLet me see: (\u221an + 2)^2 = (\u221an)^2 + 4\u221an +4 = n +4\u221an +4. Oh! That's exactly the denominator. So denominator is (\u221an + 2)^2.\n\nSo denominator is squared, which is good. Now, what about the numerator? Let me see if it can be expressed as a square as well.\n\nNumerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let me try to see if this is a square of something.\n\nWait, let me think of it as (n + something)^2.\n\nLet me suppose that the numerator is (n + a\u221an + b)^2.\n\nExpanding that: n\u00b2 + 2a n\u221an + (a\u00b2 n) + 2b n + 2ab\u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nHmm, but the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let me write that again:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2n\u221an +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo if I compare the two expressions:\n\nFrom numerator expansion:\nn\u00b2 + [2a n\u221an + 2b n] + [a\u00b2 n + 2ab\u221an + b\u00b2].\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe a different approach. Let me try to see if the numerator is (n + something)^2 plus something else.\n\nWait, n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an is part of the numerator. Let me consider that part: n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an = (\u221an)^4 + 2 (\u221an)^3. Hmm, perhaps not helpful.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me factor the numerator in terms of the denominator.\n\nWait, denominator is (\u221an + 2)^2. Let me see if numerator can be written as (something)(denominator) plus something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator is (n + 4\u221an +4) multiplied by something else. Wait, let me try dividing.\n\nWait, perhaps the numerator is (n + 4\u221an +4) multiplied by (n + something). Let me try.\n\nWait, the denominator is (\u221an + 2)^2. Let me see if numerator is (n + 4\u221an +4)(something) plus something.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to factor numerator.\n\nWait, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nLet me write that as n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, I can group n\u00b2 +2n\u221an and 8\u221an +16.\n\nn\u00b2 +2n\u221an = n(n + 2\u221an) = n(\u221an + 2)^2 - 4n? Wait, because (\u221an + 2)^2 is n +4\u221an +4. So n(\u221an +2)^2 = n^2 +4n\u221an +4n. Hmm, but that's more than the term we have.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the numerator as (n + a)^2 + something.\n\nWait, let me think of the numerator as n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + (\u221an)^2 + 8\u221an +16 - (\u221an)^2.\n\nWait, that would be (n + \u221an)^2 + 8\u221an +16 - n.\n\nWait, that's getting messy. Maybe not the right path.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the numerator as (n + 4\u221an +4) multiplied by (n + something else).\n\nLet me try to perform polynomial division, treating n and \u221an as variables.\n\nWait, maybe let me set m = \u221an. Since n is between 36 and 72, m is between 6 and 8\u221a(something) wait, n is 36 to 72. So m is \u221a36=6, and \u221a72 is approximately 8.485. So m ranges from 6 to about 8.485.\n\nSo, substituting m = \u221an, then n = m\u00b2. Let's rewrite the expression for x in terms of m.\n\nNumerator becomes: (m\u00b2)^2 + 2m (m\u00b2 +4) +16 = m^4 + 2m^3 + 8m +16.\n\nDenominator becomes: m\u00b2 +4m +4 = (m+2)^2.\n\nSo x = [m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16] / (m+2)^2.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor the numerator.\n\nLooking at numerator: m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16.\n\nHmm, let me try to factor by grouping.\n\nGroup terms as (m^4 + 2m^3) + (8m +16).\n\nFactor m^3 from first group: m^3(m +2) + 8(m +2).\n\nSo, (m^3 +8)(m +2).\n\nWait, wait! Because m^3 +8 can be factored further as (m +2)(m\u00b2 - 2m +4). So overall, numerator is (m +2)(m\u00b2 - 2m +4) (m +2).\n\nSo numerator is (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 - 2m +4).\n\nDenominator is (m+2)^2.\n\nSo when we divide numerator by denominator, the (m+2)^2 terms cancel out, leaving x = m\u00b2 - 2m +4.\n\nWow, that's a big simplification!\n\nSo x = m\u00b2 - 2m +4.\n\nSince m is between 6 and approximately 8.485, let's compute x in terms of m.\n\nSo x = m\u00b2 - 2m +4.\n\nThis is a quadratic in m. Let's see how x behaves as m varies from 6 to ~8.485.\n\nWe can compute x at the endpoints and check the minimum in between.\n\nFirst, compute x when m=6:\n\nx = 6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nThen compute x when m=8.485 (approx sqrt(72)=8.485):\n\nm=8.485:\n\nx = (8.485)^2 -2*(8.485) +4.\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n8.485^2 is approximately 72 (since n is 72, m is sqrt(72)=8.485), but let me compute it more accurately.\n\n8.485^2 = (8 + 0.485)^2 = 64 + 2*8*0.485 + (0.485)^2.\n\n= 64 + 7.76 + ~0.235 \u2248 64 +7.76=71.76 +0.235=71.995 \u224872.\n\nSo x \u224872 - 2*(8.485) +4.\n\n2*8.485 is 16.97.\n\nSo x \u224872 -16.97 +4 = (72+4) -16.97 = 76 -16.97 = 59.03.\n\nSo when m is 8.485, x is approximately 59.03.\n\nWait, but m goes up to 8.485, so x is up to around 59.\n\nWait, but wait, let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, m= sqrt(72)=8.485281374.\n\nSo m^2 =72.\n\nSo x=72 -2*(8.485281374) +4.\n\n2*8.485281374=16.97056275.\n\nSo x=72 +4 -16.97056275 =76 -16.97056275 =59.02943725.\n\nSo approximately 59.03.\n\nSo when m=6, x=28; when m=8.485, x\u224859.03.\n\nBut wait, x is a quadratic function of m: x = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nSince the quadratic is in m, and the coefficient of m\u00b2 is positive, the function is a parabola opening upwards. The vertex is at m = -b/(2a) = 2/(2*1)=1.\n\nBut since m is between 6 and 8.485, which is to the right of the vertex, the function is increasing in this interval. So x increases as m increases.\n\nTherefore, the minimum x is at m=6, which is 28, and maximum at m=8.485, which is approximately 59.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to about 59.03.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA) 20 < x <54 \u2192 28 is higher than 20, but 59 is higher than 54, so this interval doesn't cover the entire x range.\n\nB) 23 < x <58 \u2192 28 is higher than 23, and 58 is just below 59, so x could be up to about 59, which is beyond 58. So this interval is up to 58, but x can be 59. So not all x would fit in B.\n\nC) 25 < x <64 \u2192 28 is higher than 25, and 64 is higher than 59. So x would be between 28 and about 59, which is within 25-64. So this option includes all possible x.\n\nWait, but wait, x starts at 28, which is higher than 25, so the lower limit is 28, which is within 25-64. The upper limit is 59, which is less than 64, so the entire x range (28 to 59) is within 25 to 64. So option C is 25 < x <64. So x is between 28 and 59, which is entirely within 25-64. So C would include all possible x.\n\nBut let me check the other options to be sure.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 Well, when m is 6, x=28, so the lower bound is 28, which is the minimum. But 60 is higher than our maximum x of about 59.03. So x could go up to 59, which is just below 60, so x would be less than 60. So option D says x is between 28 and 60. But wait, when m=8.485, x is about 59.03, which is less than 60. So the x range is 28 < x <59.03, which fits within 28 < x <60. So option D says 28 <x <60, which is a correct interval, as our x is between 28 and ~59.\n\nWait, but wait, when m=6, x=28. So at m=6, x=28, which is the lower bound. So x can be equal to 28. But the options are inequalities, like 28 <x <60, which would exclude x=28. But in reality, when m=6, x=28 is included.\n\nSo perhaps the correct interval includes 28, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the answer is E) None of these.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again.\n\nOption D is 28 <x <60. So our x starts at 28, but when m=6, x is exactly 28. So x can be 28. So option D starts at 28, but not including it. So x=28 would not be included in D. But in reality, x can be as low as 28, so the correct interval should include 28 as a possible value. So perhaps none of the options include 28 as a possible value.\n\nWait, but the question says \"satisfies\", so perhaps the correct interval is 28 < x < ~59. So the options given are:\n\nA: 20<x<54 \u2192 doesn't cover the upper end.\n\nB:23<x<58 \u2192 doesn't cover up to 59.\n\nC:25<x<64 \u2192 covers the entire range.\n\nD:28<x<60 \u2192 covers from 28 to 60, but our x starts at 28, so D's lower bound is 28, which is not inclusive. So x can be 28, but D's lower bound is >28, so it doesn't include x=28.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"satisfies\"\u2014so if the actual x can be 28, then any option that doesn't include 28 would be incorrect. So looking at the options:\n\nOption C: 25 < x <64. So 28 is within this range. So x can be as low as 28, which is within 25 and 64. So the entire x range (28 to 59) is within 25 to 64, so option C includes all possible x values.\n\nBut wait, when m=6, x=28. So 28 is included in option C, because 25 < 28 <64. So yes, x=28 is within C's range.\n\nSo the correct interval would be 28 \u2264x <60, but since none of the options have 28 as the lower bound, perhaps the best option is C, which includes all possible x from 28 to 59.\n\nWait, but the options don't have an option that starts at 28. So perhaps the answer is C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The options are:\n\nA)20 < x <54 \u2192 no, because x can be up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 no, because x can be up to ~59.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, because x starts at 28 (which is >25) and goes up to 59 (which is <64). So all x values are within 25 and 64.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 but x can be as low as 28, which is not included in D's lower bound.\n\nSo the correct answer would be C, since 28 is higher than 25, and 59 is less than 64.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So x ranges from 28 to 59. So the options are:\n\nC)25 < x <64 \u2192 yes, because 28 is within 25-64.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 no, because x can be exactly 28, but D starts at >28.\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but another thought: when n=36, m=6, x=28. When n=72, m\u22488.485, x\u224859. So x is between 28 and 59. So looking at the options:\n\nA)20-54: 59 is above, so no.\n\nB)23-58: 59 is above 58, so no.\n\nC)25-64: 28 is within, 59 is within. So yes.\n\nD)28-60: 28 is included? Well, the options are written as 28 <x <60. So x can be 28, but D's lower bound is 28 <x, so x=28 is not included in D.\n\nSo the only option that correctly includes all possible x values is C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the math. Did I make any mistake in simplifying x?\n\nEarlier steps:\n\nExpressed x as (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16)/(n +4\u221an +4).\n\nSubstituted m=\u221an, so n=m\u00b2.\n\nNumerator became m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16.\n\nDenominator became (m+2)^2.\n\nFactored numerator as (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4).\n\nSo x = [ (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4) ] / (m+2)^2 ) = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo x = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nWhich is a quadratic, and with m from 6 to 8.485, x ranges from 28 to ~59.\n\nSo the correct interval is 28 \u2264x <59.03.\n\nLooking at the options, C)25 <x <64 includes this entire range, because 28 is greater than 25, and 59 is less than 64.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the range of the expression \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4}\n\\]\n\nfor \\( n \\) in the interval \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\). \n\n### Step 1: Simplify the expression\nTo simplify \\( x \\), let \\( m = \\sqrt{n} \\), so \\( n = m^2 \\). Substituting \\( m \\) into the expression:\n\n- **Numerator**:  \n  \\[\n  n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 = m^4 + 2m^3 + 8m + 16\n  \\]\n  Factoring by grouping:  \n  \\[\n  m^4 + 2m^3 + 8m + 16 = (m^3 + 8)(m + 2) = (m + 2)^2(m^2 - 2m + 4)\n  \\]\n\n- **Denominator**:  \n  \\[\n  n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4 = m^2 + 4m + 4 = (m + 2)^2\n  \\]\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to:  \n\\[\nx = \\frac{(m + 2)^2(m^2 - 2m + 4)}{(m + 2)^2} = m^2 - 2m + 4\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the range of \\( x \\)\nSince \\( n \\) ranges from 36 to 72, \\( m = \\sqrt{n} \\) ranges from 6 to approximately 8.485. Substituting these values into \\( x = m^2 - 2m + 4 \\):\n\n- **At \\( m = 6 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  x = 6^2 - 2(6) + 4 = 36 - 12 + 4 = 28\n  \\]\n\n- **At \\( m \\approx 8.485 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  x \\approx (8.485)^2 - 2(8.485) + 4 \\approx 72 - 16.97 + 4 \\approx 59.03\n  \\]\n\nThus, \\( x \\) ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\n### Step 3: Compare with the options\nThe options are:\n\n- **A)** \\( 20 < x < 54 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x \\) can exceed 54 (up to ~59.03).  \n- **B)** \\( 23 < x < 58 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x \\) can exceed 58 (up to ~59.03).  \n- **C)** \\( 25 < x < 64 \\): Correct, as \\( x \\) ranges from 28 to ~59.03, which is entirely within this interval.  \n- **D)** \\( 28 < x < 60 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x \\) can be exactly 28, but this option excludes it.  \n- **E)** \\( \\text{None of these} \\): Incorrect, as option C is valid.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct interval for \\( x \\) is \\( 25 < x < 64 \\), which corresponds to option **C**.\n\n**Answer: C**",
