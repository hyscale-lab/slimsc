      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. The question says that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. Their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. One of the integers is 350, and I need to find the other one. The options are A)242, B)308, C)352, D)412, E)456.\n\nHmm, I remember that there's a relationship between the GCF and LCM of two numbers. Oh right! The product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So, if the two numbers are a and b, then a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b). \n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, if I know one of the numbers, I can find the other using this formula. \n\nGiven that the GCF is 11 and the LCM is 7700. One number is 350. Let me denote the other number as x. So, 350 * x = 11 * 7700. \n\nLet me calculate the right side first. 11 multiplied by 7700. Let's see, 11 times 7000 is 77,000, and 11 times 700 is 7,700. Wait, no, wait. 7700 is 7000 + 700? Wait, no, 7700 is 77 * 100. So, 11 * 7700 is 11*77*100. 11*77 is 847, so 847 * 100 is 84,700. So, 350 * x = 84,700. \n\nSo, to find x, I can divide 84,700 by 350. Let me compute that. 350 into 84,700. \n\nHmm, 350 times 200 is 70,000. Subtract that from 84,700, leaves 14,700. 350 times 40 is 14,000. So 240 so far, and 700 left. 350 goes into 700 twice. So total is 242. Oh wait, 200 +40+2=242. So x is 242. \n\nWait, but 242 is one of the options. It's option A. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes I might make a mistake in calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should verify if 350 and 242 indeed have a GCF of 11 and LCM of 7700.\n\nLet's find the GCF of 350 and 242. \n\nFirst, factor both numbers.\n\n350: Well, 350 divided by 2 is 175. 175 is 5^2 *7. So 350 = 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242: Let's see, 242 divided by 2 is 121. 121 is 11^2. So 242 = 2 *11^2.\n\nSo the GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of the common primes. The primes involved are 2,5,7,11. Only 2 is common. So GCF is 2^1 = 2. Wait, but the problem says the GCF is 11. Oh, that's a problem. That can't be right. So my initial answer of 242 can't be correct because their GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but maybe I should consider that the two numbers must have 11 as a common factor. Because the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11.\n\nSo, 350 is one of the numbers. Is 350 a multiple of 11? Let me check. 11 times 31 is 341. 11 times 32 is 352. So 350 is between 341 and 352. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. Wait, that's a problem. Because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So, if one of them is 350, which isn't a multiple of 11, that would make the GCF not 11. That can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction. Because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be divisible by 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But 350 divided by 11 is 31.818..., which isn't an integer. So this suggests that the problem has no solution? But that's not possible because the problem states that it's given.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if a is 350, and GCF is 11, then the other number x must be such that 350 and x have a GCF of 11. \n\nWait, but 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So that's impossible. So that would mean that perhaps the problem is incorrectly set. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I should not directly use the formula. Let me try a different approach.\n\nSince the GCF is 11, I can express both numbers as 11 times some integers. Let me say that a = 11*m and b=11*n, where m and n are integers. Since the GCF is 11, m and n must be coprime; their GCF is 1.\n\nSo, the LCM of a and b is 7700. The LCM of 11m and 11n is 11 * m * n, because since m and n are coprime, their LCM is m*n. So 11 * m * n = 7700. So m*n = 7700 / 11 = 700.\n\nSo m*n=700. Also, since a is 350, which is 11*m. So 11*m =350. Wait, but 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818, which is not an integer. So m would be 350/11, which is not an integer. So this suggests that the problem has no solution, but that's impossible because the problem gives an answer. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing which number is which. Maybe the given number is 350, which is a, and the other is x. So, a=350, which is 11*m, so 350=11*m. But 350 is not a multiple of 11, so m isn't an integer. Therefore, this approach leads to a contradiction. So maybe the initial formula approach was correct, but then the problem must have a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial approach. Let me re-express the formula. So, a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 * x = 11 * 7700. Let me calculate 11*7700. 7700 *10 is 77,000; 7700 *11 is 77,000 +7700=84,700. So 350 * x=84,700. So x=84,700 /350.\n\nLet me compute that again. 84,700 divided by 350. Let me see, 350 *200=70,000. 350*240=84,000. Because 350*200=70,000, 350*40=14,000. 70k +14k=84k. So 240 times 350 is 84,000. Then 84,700 minus 84,000 is 700. So 700 divided by 350 is 2. So x=240+2=242. So x=242.\n\nBut earlier, when I checked the GCF of 350 and 242, I found it to be 2, not 11. So that's a problem. So either the formula is wrong, or I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the GCF calculation. Let me check again. 350 is 2*5^2 *7. 242 is 2*11^2. So the common prime factors are just 2^1. So GCF is 2, which contradicts the given GCF of 11. So 242 can't be the correct answer.\n\nHmm, so where did I go wrong? Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but the other number is 242, but the GCF isn't 11. So that suggests that the problem is set incorrectly, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's find the other number x such that GCF(350, x)=11 and LCM(350, x)=7700.\n\nSo, since GCF is 11, x must be a multiple of 11, and 350 must also be a multiple of 11, but earlier I found that 350 is not a multiple of 11. So that's a problem. So perhaps the problem has no solution. But the question gives options, so that's not possible. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check whether 350 is a multiple of 11. Let me compute 11 * 31 = 341, 341 +11=352. So 350 is between 341 and 352, which are 11*31 and 11*32. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. So if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't, which is a contradiction. So perhaps the problem is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck the formula. The formula is indeed correct: a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if the GCF is 11, and LCM is 7700, then 350 * x =11 *7700=84,700. So x=84,700/350=242. So according to the formula, x=242.\n\nBut then, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11, which is a problem. So this suggests that the answer is not possible, but the options are given, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the GCF. Let me try another method. Let's compute the GCF of 350 and 242 using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n350 divided by 242 is 1 with a remainder of 108. Because 242 *1=242, 350-242=108.\n\nNow, take 242 and divide by 108. 108 *2=216, remainder 26.\n\nNext, take 108 and divide by 26. 26*4=104, remainder 4.\n\nNext, take 26 divided by 4. 4*6=24, remainder 2.\n\nThen, take 4 divided by 2. 2*2=4, remainder 0. So the GCF is 2. So indeed, the GCF is 2, not 11. So this is a problem because the problem states the GCF is 11.\n\nHmm, so that suggests that the other number can't be 242, because it doesn't have a GCF of 11 with 350.\n\nBut according to the formula, the other number is 242. So I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all the options to see which one has a GCF of 11 with 350 and an LCM of 7700.\n\nLet's go through the options:\n\nOption A) 242: As above, GCF is 2, so no.\n\nOption B) 308: Let's see.\n\nFirst, find GCF of 350 and 308.\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n308: Let's factor 308. 308 divided by 2 is 154. 154 divided by 2 is 77. 77 is 7*11. So 308=2^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo the GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of the common primes.\n\nCommon primes are 2 and 7.\n\nSo 2^1 (since 350 has 2^1, 308 has 2^2) and 7^1. So GCF is 2*7=14. So not 11. So option B is out.\n\nOption C) 352: Let's factor 352.\n\n352: Divided by 2 is 176. 176 divided by 2 is 88. 88 divided by 2 is 44. 44 divided by 2 is 22. 22 divided by 2 is 11. So 352=2^5 *11.\n\n350 is 2*5^2*7.\n\nCommon primes: 2. So GCF is 2. So no.\n\nOption D)412: Let's factor 412.\n\n412 divided by 2 is 206. 206 divided by 2 is 103. 103 is a prime. So 412=2^2 *103.\n\n350 is 2*5^2*7. So common prime is 2. So GCF is 2. So no.\n\nOption E)456: Let's factor 456.\n\n456 divided by 2 is 228. 228/2=114. 114/2=57. 57 is 3*19. So 456=2^3 *3*19.\n\n350 is 2*5^2*7. So common prime is 2. So GCF is 2. So none of the options except A and B have higher GCFs, but neither reach 11.\n\nWait, this is a problem. None of the options have a GCF of 11 with 350. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but I made a mistake in calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that 350 isn't a multiple of 11, but the other number is. So the GCF would be 1, not 11, unless both are multiples of 11. So perhaps the problem is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, perhaps the formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 *x = 11 *7700 =84,700. So x=242.\n\nBut as we saw, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that's a problem. So perhaps the problem is incorrect.\n\nWait, but the question gives options, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the problem says that the GCF is 11, but that's not possible if one number isn't a multiple of 11.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe I should compute the other number as 11 times something, and 350 is 11 times something else.\n\nWait, but 350 is not a multiple of 11. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 *x=11 *7700=84,700. x=84,700/350=242.\n\nBut then, the GCF is 2, which contradicts the problem. So perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options, but that can't be because the options are given. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of 84,700 divided by 350.\n\nLet me compute 350 * 242.\n\n350*200=70,000.\n\n350*40=14,000.\n\n350*2=700.\n\n70,000 +14,000=84,000.\n\n84,000 +700=84,700. So yes, 350*242=84,700.\n\nSo the formula is correct, but the GCF isn't 11. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, 350 is 2 *5^2 *7. 242 is 2 *11^2.\n\nSo the GCF is 2, as the only common prime factor. So the problem states that the GCF is 11, which is not possible. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's not possible because the options are provided.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: The GCF is 11, so both numbers must be multiples of 11. Let me denote the two numbers as 11a and 11b, where a and b are coprime (their GCF is 1).\n\nThe LCM of 11a and 11b would be 11*a*b, since a and b are coprime.\n\nGiven that LCM is 7700, so 11*a*b=7700. So a*b=7700/11=700.\n\nSo a*b=700, and since a and b are coprime, we need to find pairs (a,b) such that a*b=700 and GCF(a,b)=1.\n\nAdditionally, one of the numbers is 350. So either 11a=350 or 11b=350.\n\nWait, 350 divided by 11 is not an integer, so neither a nor b can be 350/11, which is not an integer. So this suggests that there's no solution where both numbers are multiples of 11, which is required for the GCF to be 11. So the problem might be wrong.\n\nBut since the problem gives an answer, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the given number is 350, which is a multiple of 11. Let me check again. 350 /11=31.818... No, it's not. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem meant that one of the numbers is 350, but the other isn't necessarily a multiple of 11. But that can't be because the GCF is 11, so both must be multiples of 11. So that can't be.\n\nSo this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem. But since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the other number is 242, but the GCF is 11. But according to the factors, it's 2. So I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 * x =11 *7700=84,700. So x=242. But then, perhaps the GCF is 11, but my earlier calculation was wrong. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation. Let me compute the GCF of 350 and 242 again using another method.\n\nList the factors of each number.\n\n350: factors include 1,2,5,7,10,14,25,35,50,70,175,350.\n\n242: factors include 1,2,11,22,121,242.\n\nThe common factors are 1 and 2. So the greatest is 2. So yes, the GCF is 2. So the problem's statement that the GCF is 11 is incorrect.\n\nSo this suggests that the problem is wrong, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem meant that the GCF is 2, but that's not the case. So I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the initial answer of 242, even though it contradicts the GCF condition. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any of the options have a GCF of 11 with 350.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 242. GCF with 350 is 2.\n\nOption B:308. GCF is 14.\n\nOption C:352. GCF is 2.\n\nOption D:412. GCF is 2.\n\nOption E:456. GCF is 2.\n\nNone have GCF 11. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but that's not stated. Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but the problem expects me to proceed despite the GCF being incorrect. So the answer would be 242, but that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check for a different approach.\n\nWait, let me try to find the other number x such that GCF(350, x)=11 and LCM(350, x)=7700.\n\nSince GCF is 11, x must be 11 times some integer k, and 350 must be 11 times some integer m. But 350 isn't divisible by 11, so that's impossible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me think again. The formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 * x =11 *7700=84,700. So x=242.\n\nBut as we've determined, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So the problem's condition can't be satisfied. So perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but that's not possible because the options are given.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. The formula suggests x=242, but the GCF condition isn't met. So perhaps the problem has a mistake, but I have to choose from the options. So perhaps the intended answer is A)242, despite the GCF being incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation. Let me compute it again.\n\nCompute GCF(350,242):\n\nUsing prime factors:\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242: 2 *11^2.\n\nCommon factors: 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nSo no, the GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is wrong, but I have to choose from the options. Since 242 is the only option that fits the formula, perhaps the answer is 242, despite the GCF not being 11. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should choose the option that has a GCF of 11 with 350, but none do.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any of the options, when paired with 350, have a GCF of 11. Let me check option B)308.\n\n350 and 308.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\n308=2^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo the common factors are 2 and 7. So GCF is 2*7=14. So no.\n\nOption C)352: 352=2^5*11.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\nCommon factor: 2. So GCF=2.\n\nOption D)412: 412=2^2 *103.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\nCommon factor:2. GCF=2.\n\nOption E)456: 456=2^3 *3 *19.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\nCommon factor:2. GCF=2.\n\nSo none have GCF 11 with 350.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since I have to choose an option, perhaps the intended answer is A)242, despite the contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but the problem is that one number is 350, which is not a multiple of 11, so the GCF can't be 11. Therefore, there's no solution, but the options are given, so perhaps the problem intended that the GCF is 2, but that's not what the question says.\n\nHmm, I'm really stuck here. The only way I can proceed is to choose the answer as A)242, but it contradicts the GCF condition. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but that's not what was stated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the other number is 350 multiplied by something. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the other number is 350 multiplied by 7700 divided by (11*350). Let me compute that.\n\nWait, the formula is x = (GCF * LCM) / a = (11 * 7700)/350.\n\nCompute 11 *7700 =84,700.\n\n84,700 /350=242.\n\nSo yes, x=242. But as we saw, the GCF is 2, not 11. So the problem's conditions can't be satisfied. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So perhaps I should proceed with that and accept that the answer is 242, even though the GCF condition isn't met. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended that the GCF is 11, but in that case, the given number must be a multiple of 11, which 350 isn't. So perhaps the problem has a mistake.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the formula suggesting x=242, the GCF condition isn't satisfied. But since the options are given, and 242 is the only one that fits the formula, perhaps the intended answer is A)242.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem states that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350. The task is to find the other integer.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Relationship Between GCF and LCM**: The formula connecting GCF and LCM is:\n   \\[\n   a \\times b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b)\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given values:\n   \\[\n   350 \\times x = 11 \\times 7700\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the right-hand side:\n   \\[\n   11 \\times 7700 = 84,700\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{84,700}{350} = 242\n   \\]\n\n2. **Verification of GCF**: The calculated value of \\(x\\) is 242. To verify if the GCF of 350 and 242 is indeed 11:\n   - Prime factorization:\n     - \\(350 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7\\)\n     - \\(242 = 2 \\times 11^2\\)\n   - The common prime factor is 2, so the GCF is \\(2\\), not 11. This contradicts the problem's condition that the GCF is 11.\n\n3. **Checking Other Options**: The problem provides five options, and each is analyzed for the GCF with 350:\n   - **Option A (242)**: GCF is 2 (as shown above).\n   - **Option B (308)**: \\(308 = 2^2 \\times 7 \\times 11\\). Common factors with 350 are 2 and 7, so GCF is \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\).\n   - **Option C (352)**: \\(352 = 2^5 \\times 11\\). Common factor with 350 is 2, so GCF is 2.\n   - **Option D (412)**: \\(412 = 2^2 \\times 103\\). Common factor with 350 is 2, so GCF is 2.\n   - **Option E (456)**: \\(456 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 19\\). Common factor with 350 is 2, so GCF is 2.\n\n   None of the options satisfy the condition that the GCF is 11.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The formula suggests \\(x = 242\\), but this does not satisfy the GCF condition. The problem likely contains an inconsistency, as the given conditions cannot be simultaneously satisfied. However, since the options are provided, and \\(242\\) is the only value that fits the formula, it is the most reasonable choice despite the contradiction.\n\nANSWER: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. The question says that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. Their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700. One of the integers is 350, and I need to find the other one. The options are A)242, B)308, C)352, D)412, E)456.\n\nHmm, I remember that there's a relationship between the GCF and LCM of two numbers. Oh right! The product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So, if the two numbers are a and b, then a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b). \n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, if I know one of the numbers, I can find the other using this formula. \n\nGiven that the GCF is 11 and the LCM is 7700. One number is 350. Let me denote the other number as x. So, 350 * x = 11 * 7700. \n\nLet me calculate the right side first. 11 multiplied by 7700. Let's see, 11 times 7000 is 77,000, and 11 times 700 is 7,700. Wait, no, wait. 7700 is 7000 + 700? Wait, no, 7700 is 77 * 100. So, 11 * 7700 is 11*77*100. 11*77 is 847, so 847 * 100 is 84,700. So, 350 * x = 84,700. \n\nSo, to find x, I can divide 84,700 by 350. Let me compute that. 350 into 84,700. \n\nHmm, 350 times 200 is 70,000. Subtract that from 84,700, leaves 14,700. 350 times 40 is 14,000. So 240 so far, and 700 left. 350 goes into 700 twice. So total is 242. Oh wait, 200 +40+2=242. So x is 242. \n\nWait, but 242 is one of the options. It's option A. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes I might make a mistake in calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should verify if 350 and 242 indeed have a GCF of 11 and LCM of 7700.\n\nLet's find the GCF of 350 and 242. \n\nFirst, factor both numbers.\n\n350: Well, 350 divided by 2 is 175. 175 is 5^2 *7. So 350 = 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242: Let's see, 242 divided by 2 is 121. 121 is 11^2. So 242 = 2 *11^2.\n\nSo the GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of the common primes. The primes involved are 2,5,7,11. Only 2 is common. So GCF is 2^1 = 2. Wait, but the problem says the GCF is 11. Oh, that's a problem. That can't be right. So my initial answer of 242 can't be correct because their GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but maybe I should consider that the two numbers must have 11 as a common factor. Because the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11.\n\nSo, 350 is one of the numbers. Is 350 a multiple of 11? Let me check. 11 times 31 is 341. 11 times 32 is 352. So 350 is between 341 and 352. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. Wait, that's a problem. Because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So, if one of them is 350, which isn't a multiple of 11, that would make the GCF not 11. That can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction. Because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be divisible by 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But 350 divided by 11 is 31.818..., which isn't an integer. So this suggests that the problem has no solution? But that's not possible because the problem states that it's given.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if a is 350, and GCF is 11, then the other number x must be such that 350 and x have a GCF of 11. \n\nWait, but 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So that's impossible. So that would mean that perhaps the problem is incorrectly set. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I should not directly use the formula. Let me try a different approach.\n\nSince the GCF is 11, I can express both numbers as 11 times some integers. Let me say that a = 11*m and b=11*n, where m and n are integers. Since the GCF is 11, m and n must be coprime; their GCF is 1.\n\nSo, the LCM of a and b is 7700. The LCM of 11m and 11n is 11 * m * n, because since m and n are coprime, their LCM is m*n. So 11 * m * n = 7700. So m*n = 7700 / 11 = 700.\n\nSo m*n=700. Also, since a is 350, which is 11*m. So 11*m =350. Wait, but 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818, which is not an integer. So m would be 350/11, which is not an integer. So this suggests that the problem has no solution, but that's impossible because the problem gives an answer. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing which number is which. Maybe the given number is 350, which is a, and the other is x. So, a=350, which is 11*m, so 350=11*m. But 350 is not a multiple of 11, so m isn't an integer. Therefore, this approach leads to a contradiction. So maybe the initial formula approach was correct, but then the problem must have a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial approach. Let me re-express the formula. So, a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 * x = 11 * 7700. Let me calculate 11*7700. 7700 *10 is 77,000; 7700 *11 is 77,000 +7700=84,700. So 350 * x=84,700. So x=84,700 /350.\n\nLet me compute that again. 84,700 divided by 350. Let me see, 350 *200=70,000. 350*240=84,000. Because 350*200=70,000, 350*40=14,000. 70k +14k=84k. So 240 times 350 is 84,000. Then 84,700 minus 84,000 is 700. So 700 divided by 350 is 2. So x=240+2=242. So x=242.\n\nBut earlier, when I checked the GCF of 350 and 242, I found it to be 2, not 11. So that's a problem. So either the formula is wrong, or I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the GCF calculation. Let me check again. 350 is 2*5^2 *7. 242 is 2*11^2. So the common prime factors are just 2^1. So GCF is 2, which contradicts the given GCF of 11. So 242 can't be the correct answer.\n\nHmm, so where did I go wrong? Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but the other number is 242, but the GCF isn't 11. So that suggests that the problem is set incorrectly, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's find the other number x such that GCF(350, x)=11 and LCM(350, x)=7700.\n\nSo, since GCF is 11, x must be a multiple of 11, and 350 must also be a multiple of 11, but earlier I found that 350 is not a multiple of 11. So that's a problem. So perhaps the problem has no solution. But the question gives options, so that's not possible. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check whether 350 is a multiple of 11. Let me compute 11 * 31 = 341, 341 +11=352. So 350 is between 341 and 352, which are 11*31 and 11*32. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. So if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't, which is a contradiction. So perhaps the problem is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck the formula. The formula is indeed correct: a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So if the GCF is 11, and LCM is 7700, then 350 * x =11 *7700=84,700. So x=84,700/350=242. So according to the formula, x=242.\n\nBut then, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11, which is a problem. So this suggests that the answer is not possible, but the options are given, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the GCF. Let me try another method. Let's compute the GCF of 350 and 242 using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n350 divided by 242 is 1 with a remainder of 108. Because 242 *1=242, 350-242=108.\n\nNow, take 242 and divide by 108. 108 *2=216, remainder 26.\n\nNext, take 108 and divide by 26. 26*4=104, remainder 4.\n\nNext, take 26 divided by 4. 4*6=24, remainder 2.\n\nThen, take 4 divided by 2. 2*2=4, remainder 0. So the GCF is 2. So indeed, the GCF is 2, not 11. So this is a problem because the problem states the GCF is 11.\n\nHmm, so that suggests that the other number can't be 242, because it doesn't have a GCF of 11 with 350.\n\nBut according to the formula, the other number is 242. So I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all the options to see which one has a GCF of 11 with 350 and an LCM of 7700.\n\nLet's go through the options:\n\nOption A) 242: As above, GCF is 2, so no.\n\nOption B) 308: Let's see.\n\nFirst, find GCF of 350 and 308.\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n308: Let's factor 308. 308 divided by 2 is 154. 154 divided by 2 is 77. 77 is 7*11. So 308=2^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo the GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of the common primes.\n\nCommon primes are 2 and 7.\n\nSo 2^1 (since 350 has 2^1, 308 has 2^2) and 7^1. So GCF is 2*7=14. So not 11. So option B is out.\n\nOption C) 352: Let's factor 352.\n\n352: Divided by 2 is 176. 176 divided by 2 is 88. 88 divided by 2 is 44. 44 divided by 2 is 22. 22 divided by 2 is 11. So 352=2^5 *11.\n\n350 is 2*5^2*7.\n\nCommon primes: 2. So GCF is 2. So no.\n\nOption D)412: Let's factor 412.\n\n412 divided by 2 is 206. 206 divided by 2 is 103. 103 is a prime. So 412=2^2 *103.\n\n350 is 2*5^2*7. So common prime is 2. So GCF is 2. So no.\n\nOption E)456: Let's factor 456.\n\n456 divided by 2 is 228. 228/2=114. 114/2=57. 57 is 3*19. So 456=2^3 *3*19.\n\n350 is 2*5^2*7. So common prime is 2. So GCF is 2. So none of the options except A and B have higher GCFs, but neither reach 11.\n\nWait, this is a problem. None of the options have a GCF of 11 with 350. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but I made a mistake in calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that 350 isn't a multiple of 11, but the other number is. So the GCF would be 1, not 11, unless both are multiples of 11. So perhaps the problem is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, perhaps the formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 *x = 11 *7700 =84,700. So x=242.\n\nBut as we saw, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that's a problem. So perhaps the problem is incorrect.\n\nWait, but the question gives options, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the problem says that the GCF is 11, but that's not possible if one number isn't a multiple of 11.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe I should compute the other number as 11 times something, and 350 is 11 times something else.\n\nWait, but 350 is not a multiple of 11. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 *x=11 *7700=84,700. x=84,700/350=242.\n\nBut then, the GCF is 2, which contradicts the problem. So perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options, but that can't be because the options are given. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of 84,700 divided by 350.\n\nLet me compute 350 * 242.\n\n350*200=70,000.\n\n350*40=14,000.\n\n350*2=700.\n\n70,000 +14,000=84,000.\n\n84,000 +700=84,700. So yes, 350*242=84,700.\n\nSo the formula is correct, but the GCF isn't 11. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, 350 is 2 *5^2 *7. 242 is 2 *11^2.\n\nSo the GCF is 2, as the only common prime factor. So the problem states that the GCF is 11, which is not possible. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's not possible because the options are provided.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: The GCF is 11, so both numbers must be multiples of 11. Let me denote the two numbers as 11a and 11b, where a and b are coprime (their GCF is 1).\n\nThe LCM of 11a and 11b would be 11*a*b, since a and b are coprime.\n\nGiven that LCM is 7700, so 11*a*b=7700. So a*b=7700/11=700.\n\nSo a*b=700, and since a and b are coprime, we need to find pairs (a,b) such that a*b=700 and GCF(a,b)=1.\n\nAdditionally, one of the numbers is 350. So either 11a=350 or 11b=350.\n\nWait, 350 divided by 11 is not an integer, so neither a nor b can be 350/11, which is not an integer. So this suggests that there's no solution where both numbers are multiples of 11, which is required for the GCF to be 11. So the problem might be wrong.\n\nBut since the problem gives an answer, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the given number is 350, which is a multiple of 11. Let me check again. 350 /11=31.818... No, it's not. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem meant that one of the numbers is 350, but the other isn't necessarily a multiple of 11. But that can't be because the GCF is 11, so both must be multiples of 11. So that can't be.\n\nSo this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem. But since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the other number is 242, but the GCF is 11. But according to the factors, it's 2. So I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 * x =11 *7700=84,700. So x=242. But then, perhaps the GCF is 11, but my earlier calculation was wrong. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation. Let me compute the GCF of 350 and 242 again using another method.\n\nList the factors of each number.\n\n350: factors include 1,2,5,7,10,14,25,35,50,70,175,350.\n\n242: factors include 1,2,11,22,121,242.\n\nThe common factors are 1 and 2. So the greatest is 2. So yes, the GCF is 2. So the problem's statement that the GCF is 11 is incorrect.\n\nSo this suggests that the problem is wrong, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem meant that the GCF is 2, but that's not the case. So I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the initial answer of 242, even though it contradicts the GCF condition. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any of the options have a GCF of 11 with 350.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 242. GCF with 350 is 2.\n\nOption B:308. GCF is 14.\n\nOption C:352. GCF is 2.\n\nOption D:412. GCF is 2.\n\nOption E:456. GCF is 2.\n\nNone have GCF 11. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but that's not stated. Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but the problem expects me to proceed despite the GCF being incorrect. So the answer would be 242, but that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check for a different approach.\n\nWait, let me try to find the other number x such that GCF(350, x)=11 and LCM(350, x)=7700.\n\nSince GCF is 11, x must be 11 times some integer k, and 350 must be 11 times some integer m. But 350 isn't divisible by 11, so that's impossible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me think again. The formula is a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So 350 * x =11 *7700=84,700. So x=242.\n\nBut as we've determined, the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So the problem's condition can't be satisfied. So perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but that's not possible because the options are given.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. The formula suggests x=242, but the GCF condition isn't met. So perhaps the problem has a mistake, but I have to choose from the options. So perhaps the intended answer is A)242, despite the GCF being incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation. Let me compute it again.\n\nCompute GCF(350,242):\n\nUsing prime factors:\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242: 2 *11^2.\n\nCommon factors: 2. So GCF is 2.\n\nSo no, the GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is wrong, but I have to choose from the options. Since 242 is the only option that fits the formula, perhaps the answer is 242, despite the GCF not being 11. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should choose the option that has a GCF of 11 with 350, but none do.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any of the options, when paired with 350, have a GCF of 11. Let me check option B)308.\n\n350 and 308.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\n308=2^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo the common factors are 2 and 7. So GCF is 2*7=14. So no.\n\nOption C)352: 352=2^5*11.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\nCommon factor: 2. So GCF=2.\n\nOption D)412: 412=2^2 *103.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\nCommon factor:2. GCF=2.\n\nOption E)456: 456=2^3 *3 *19.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\nCommon factor:2. GCF=2.\n\nSo none have GCF 11 with 350.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since I have to choose an option, perhaps the intended answer is A)242, despite the contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but the problem is that one number is 350, which is not a multiple of 11, so the GCF can't be 11. Therefore, there's no solution, but the options are given, so perhaps the problem intended that the GCF is 2, but that's not what the question says.\n\nHmm, I'm really stuck here. The only way I can proceed is to choose the answer as A)242, but it contradicts the GCF condition. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but that's not what was stated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the other number is 350 multiplied by something. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the other number is 350 multiplied by 7700 divided by (11*350). Let me compute that.\n\nWait, the formula is x = (GCF * LCM) / a = (11 * 7700)/350.\n\nCompute 11 *7700 =84,700.\n\n84,700 /350=242.\n\nSo yes, x=242. But as we saw, the GCF is 2, not 11. So the problem's conditions can't be satisfied. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b). So perhaps I should proceed with that and accept that the answer is 242, even though the GCF condition isn't met. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended that the GCF is 11, but in that case, the given number must be a multiple of 11, which 350 isn't. So perhaps the problem has a mistake.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the formula suggesting x=242, the GCF condition isn't satisfied. But since the options are given, and 242 is the only one that fits the formula, perhaps the intended answer is A)242.\n\n\nThe problem states that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350. The task is to find the other integer.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Relationship Between GCF and LCM**: The formula connecting GCF and LCM is:\n   \\[\n   a \\times b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b)\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given values:\n   \\[\n   350 \\times x = 11 \\times 7700\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the right-hand side:\n   \\[\n   11 \\times 7700 = 84,700\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{84,700}{350} = 242\n   \\]\n\n2. **Verification of GCF**: The calculated value of \\(x\\) is 242. To verify if the GCF of 350 and 242 is indeed 11:\n   - Prime factorization:\n     - \\(350 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7\\)\n     - \\(242 = 2 \\times 11^2\\)\n   - The common prime factor is 2, so the GCF is \\(2\\), not 11. This contradicts the problem's condition that the GCF is 11.\n\n3. **Checking Other Options**: The problem provides five options, and each is analyzed for the GCF with 350:\n   - **Option A (242)**: GCF is 2 (as shown above).\n   - **Option B (308)**: \\(308 = 2^2 \\times 7 \\times 11\\). Common factors with 350 are 2 and 7, so GCF is \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\).\n   - **Option C (352)**: \\(352 = 2^5 \\times 11\\). Common factor with 350 is 2, so GCF is 2.\n   - **Option D (412)**: \\(412 = 2^2 \\times 103\\). Common factor with 350 is 2, so GCF is 2.\n   - **Option E (456)**: \\(456 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 19\\). Common factor with 350 is 2, so GCF is 2.\n\n   None of the options satisfy the condition that the GCF is 11.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The formula suggests \\(x = 242\\), but this does not satisfy the GCF condition. The problem likely contains an inconsistency, as the given conditions cannot be simultaneously satisfied. However, since the options are provided, and \\(242\\) is the only value that fits the formula, it is the most reasonable choice despite the contradiction.\n\nANSWER: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the other integer when given the greatest common factor (GCF) and the least common multiple (LCM). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe question says that the GCF of two positive integers is 11, and their LCM is 7700. One of the integers is 350, and I need to find the other. The options are A)242, B)308, C)352, D)412, E)456.\n\nWait, I remember there's a formula that relates GCF and LCM of two numbers. Oh right! The product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So, if the two numbers are a and b, then a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b).\n\nRight, so let me apply that here. Let's denote the two integers as a and b. We know a is 350, so 350 * b = 11 * 7700. Let me compute the right side first.\n\n11 multiplied by 7700. Let's see, 7700 divided by 11 is 700, because 11 * 700 is 7700. So 11 * 7700 would be 7700 * 11. Wait, no, that's the same as 7700 * 11. Let me calculate that. 7700 * 10 is 77,000, plus another 7700 is 84,700. So the product a*b is 84,700.\n\nSo 350 * b = 84,700. To find b, I divide both sides by 350. Let's do that: b = 84,700 / 350.\n\nHmm, let me compute that. 350 goes into 84,700 how many times? Well, 350 * 200 is 70,000. Subtracting that from 84,700 gives 14,700. 350 * 40 is 14,000, so that leaves 700. 350 * 2 is 700. So adding those together: 200 + 40 + 2 = 242. So b is 242. Oh wait, but 242 is option A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. I should check if that makes sense with the GCF being 11. Because sometimes, just because the product fits, the GCF might not match.\n\nSo, the two numbers are 350 and 242. Let's find their GCF.\n\nFirst, factor both numbers into primes.\n\n350: Let's break it down. 350 = 35 * 10 = (5*7) * (2*5) = 2 * 5^2 * 7.\n\n242: 242 divided by 2 is 121. 121 is 11 squared. So 242 = 2 * 11^2.\n\nSo the prime factors of 350 are 2, 5, 5, 7. For 242, they are 2, 11, 11.\n\nThe GCF is the product of the smallest power of all common primes. The common prime here is 2. Both have at least one 2. So GCF is 2. But wait, the problem states the GCF is 11, not 2. Oh no, that's a problem. That means I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, so my initial calculation gave me 242, but that doesn't have GCF 11 with 350. So that can't be the correct answer. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me go back. The formula says a*b = GCF * LCM. So 350 * b = 11 *7700. So 11 *7700 is 84,700. 84,700 divided by 350 is indeed 242. So mathematically, that's correct. But since the GCF isn't 11, I must have a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me double-check the formula. Oh wait, the formula is correct: product equals GCF multiplied by LCM. So the calculation is correct. So why is the GCF coming out as 2 instead of 11?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the GCF of 350 and 242. Let me check that again. 350 is 2 *5^2 *7. 242 is 2 *11^2. So the common factors are only 2. So GCF is 2, not 11. That contradicts the problem statement, which says the GCF is 11.\n\nSo that means that 242 can't be the correct answer. Therefore, I must have done something wrong. But according to the formula, it's 242. So what's the issue here?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again. Let me denote the two numbers as a and b. a is 350, and GCF(a,b)=11. So a must be a multiple of 11, right? Because the GCF is 11.\n\nWait, 350 divided by 11. Let me check: 11*31 is 341, 11*32 is 352. So 350 is between 341 and 352, meaning it's not a multiple of 11. Oh no! So 350 is not a multiple of 11. But the GCF of 350 and the other number is 11, which implies that both numbers must be multiples of 11. Because GCF is the greatest common factor, so 11 must divide both numbers.\n\nWait, but 350 is not a multiple of 11. That's a problem. Because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818, which is not an integer. So that's impossible. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, wait. Is there a mistake in the problem statement? Because if one of the numbers is 350, and the GCF is 11, then 350 must be divisible by 11, but it's not. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating whether 350 is divisible by 11.\n\nLet me check: 11 times 31 is 341, and 341 plus 11 is 352. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. So that can't be. So how is this possible? Because the problem states that the GCF is 11. So either I'm misunderstanding the problem or I'm missing something.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I should re-examine the problem. It says, the greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. One of the integers is 350. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, because 11 is a common factor.\n\nBut 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So that's a contradiction. That suggests that the problem has no solution, but that's not possible because the options are given. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated 350 divided by 11. Let me compute 11*31. 31*10 is 310, 31*1 is 31, so 341. 341 plus 11 is 352. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. So how can the GCF be 11?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something here. The GCF is 11, which must divide both numbers. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't, which suggests that the problem is flawed, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me write the two numbers as a = 11 * m and b = 11 * n, where m and n are integers such that their GCF is 1, because 11 is the highest common factor. Because if m and n had a common factor greater than 1, then the GCF would be higher than 11.\n\nSo a = 11m, b = 11n, and GCF(m,n)=1.\n\nThe LCM of a and b is given as 7700. But the LCM of a and b is equal to (a*b)/GCF(a,b) = (11m *11n)/11 = 11 * m *n. Because GCF(a,b)=11.\n\nSo 11 * m *n = 7700.\n\nSo m *n = 7700 /11 = 700.\n\nSo m and n are two integers with GCF 1, and their product is 700.\n\nWe know that a is 350. So a =11m =350. So 11m =350 \u2192 m=350/11. Let's compute that: 350 \u00f7 11. 11*31=341, so 350-341=9. So m=31.818... which is not an integer. That can't be right because m has to be an integer.\n\nWait a minute, this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem because a is 350, which isn't a multiple of 11, but the GCF is 11, which requires that a is a multiple of 11. So this is impossible. But the problem gives options, so perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try a different approach. Let me represent the two numbers as a=350 and b= x, where GCF(350, x)=11, and LCM(350, x)=7700.\n\nWe know that 350 can be written as 2 * 5^2 *7.\n\nWe also know that GCF(350, x)=11. But 350 doesn't have 11 as a factor. Therefore, this is impossible because the GCF can't have a prime factor that neither number has. So that's a problem. Because 350 doesn't have 11 as a factor, the GCF cannot be 11.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the problem states that the GCF is 11. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but that's unlikely. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the GCF must be a factor of both numbers. Oh wait, that's correct. So if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But 350 is not. So this is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since it's given, I must have made a mistake. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says the GCF is 11, but 350 is not a multiple of 11, which would make this impossible. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's not possible. So perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, let me recheck the problem statement. The question says the GCF is 11, and one of the integers is 350. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the formula. The product of the two numbers is GCF multiplied by LCM. So 350 * x = 11 *7700. Which is 350x = 84,700 \u2192 x=84,700/350= 242. But 242 and 350 have a GCF of 2, not 11. So that can't be.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect. But since this is a multiple-choice question, I must choose one of the options. Let me check each option to see which one, when paired with 350, has a GCF of 11 and an LCM of 7700.\n\nLet's test each option:\n\nOption A: 242. As before, GCF(350,242)=2, which is wrong.\n\nOption B: 308. Let's compute GCF(350,308). Let's factor both.\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n308: Let's see, 308 divided by 2 is 154. 154 divided by 2 is 77. 77 is 7*11. So 308 = 2^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo the common factors between 350 and 308 are 2 and 7. So GCF is 2*7=14. That's higher than 11, so no.\n\nOption C:352. Let's factor 352.\n\n352: 32 * 11. 32 is 2^5. So 352=2^5 *11.\n\n350 is 2*5^2*7.\n\nCommon factors: only 2. So GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nOption D:412. Let's factor 412.\n\n412 divided by 2 is 206. 206 divided by 2 is 103. 103 is a prime. So 412=2^2 *103.\n\n350 is 2*5^2*7.\n\nCommon factors: only 2. GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nOption E:456. Let's factor 456.\n\n456 divided by 2 is 228. 228 divided by 2 is 114. 114 divided by 2 is 57. 57 is 3*19. So 456=2^3 *3 *19.\n\n350 is 2*5^2*7.\n\nCommon factors: 2. So GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nWait, none of the options have a GCF of 11 with 350. That suggests that the problem is flawed, but that's unlikely. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that the product a*b = GCF * LCM. Let me double-check that formula. Yes, I'm pretty sure that's correct: a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b).\n\nSo if the formula is correct, and the given data is correct, then the other number must be 242. But that doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I factorized the numbers.\n\nWait, let me check 350 and 242 again. 350 is 2 *5^2 *7. 242 is 2 *11^2. So the GCF is 2. But the problem says it's 11. So that's a problem. So perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula a*b = GCF * LCM applies when the two numbers are co-prime. No, no, the formula holds for any two positive integers. So that's not the issue.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in the problem statement. Maybe the LCM is 7700 and the GCF is 11, but one of the numbers is 350. So let's compute the other number.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me denote the two numbers as a=350 and b. Their GCF is 11. So 11 divides both a and b. But 350 isn't divisible by 11, which is a problem. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the factors.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong in thinking that 350 isn't divisible by 11. Let me compute 350 \u00f711.\n\n11 * 31 = 341. 341 +11=352. So 350 is 31*11=341, plus 9. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. So this is a problem.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrectly set. But the options are given, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the other number using the formula, even though the GCF seems to not match. Because according to the formula, the other number is 242. But that doesn't have GCF 11 with 350. So perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the GCF again. 350=2*5^2*7. 242=2*11^2.\n\nThe common prime factors are just 2, so GCF is 2. So that's correct. So the problem is impossible as stated, because 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So none of the options would work.\n\nBut the options are given, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should pick the option that gives the correct product, even if the GCF isn't 11. But that's not logical.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says the GCF is 11, but the numbers are 350 and 242, which have GCF 2. So the problem is wrong. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but that's not what's stated.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the LCM is 7700, but the GCF is 2. Let me check what would happen then.\n\nIf GCF is 2, then using the formula: 350 * b = 2 *7700=15400. So b=15400/350=44. But 44 isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 7. Let's see: 350 *b=7*7700=53900 \u2192 b=53900/350=154. 154 is not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 5. Then 350*b=5*7700=38,500 \u2192 b=38500/350=110. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the other number to be 242, but the GCF is 2. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. But the options are given, so perhaps I have to choose option A, 242.\n\nBut that's not correct because the GCF is 2, not 11. So I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says the GCF is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. So the other number must be a multiple of 11. Let me check the options to see which one is a multiple of 11.\n\nOption A:242. 242 divided by 11 is 22, so yes.\n\nOption B:308. 308/11 is 28, yes.\n\nOption C:352. 352/11 is 32, yes.\n\nOption D:412. 412/11 is approximately 37.45, so no.\n\nOption E:456. 456/11 is about 41.45, so no.\n\nSo options A, B, C are multiples of 11.\n\nSo perhaps I should check which of these, when paired with 350, gives an LCM of 7700.\n\nBecause the problem says the LCM is 7700.\n\nSo let's compute the LCM of 350 and each option.\n\nOption A:242.\n\nWe can compute LCM(350,242). First, find the prime factors.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\n242=2*11^2.\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present: 2^1,5^2,7^1,11^2.\n\nSo LCM is 2 *25 *7 * 121.\n\nCompute that: 2*25=50; 50*7=350; 350*121=42,350.\n\nWhich is much larger than 7700. So that's not the answer.\n\nOption B:308.\n\n308 is 2^2 *7 *11.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nLCM is 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nCompute that: 4 *25=100; 100 *7=700; 700 *11=7700.\n\nAh! So the LCM of 350 and 308 is 7700, which matches the problem's condition.\n\nAdditionally, the GCF of 350 and 308.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\n308=2^2 *7 *11.\n\nCommon factors: 2^1 and 7^1. So GCF is 2*7=14. But the problem states the GCF is 11. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the GCF is 11, but in this case, it's 14. So that can't be the correct option.\n\nHmm, but the LCM is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation.\n\nWait, 350 and 308.\n\n350's factors: 2,5,5,7.\n\n308's factors: 2,2,7,11.\n\nSo the GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of the common primes. Common primes are 2 and 7.\n\nSo 2^1 and 7^1. So GCF is 2*7=14. So that's correct. So the problem's condition for GCF is 11, which isn't met here. So option B is out.\n\nOption C:352.\n\n352 is 2^5 *11.\n\n350 is 2*5^2*7.\n\nSo LCM is 2^5 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nCompute that: 32 *25=800; 800 *7=5600; 5600 *11=61,600. Which is way larger than 7700. So not the option.\n\nSo none of the options meet both conditions. Wait, but option B met the LCM condition but not the GCF.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial formula was applied correctly, but the problem requires that the other number is 242, even though it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. So perhaps the answer is option A.\n\nBut that can't be because the GCF would be 2, not 11. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended that the GCF is 11, and the LCM is 7700, but one of the numbers is 350. So the other number must be (11 *7700)/350 = (84700)/350 = 242. But then the GCF is 2, which doesn't fit. So perhaps the problem is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 14, but that's not what's stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the LCM for option B. Let me recheck.\n\nFor option B, 308.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\n308=2^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo the LCM would be the product of the highest exponents: 2^2,5^2,7^1,11^1.\n\nSo 4 *25 =100, *7=700, *11=7700. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the LCM is correct, but the GCF is 14, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but since the problem requires it, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem states that the GCF is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, which it isn't. So this suggests that the problem is impossible as stated. But the options are given, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem actually meant that the GCF is 7, not 11. Let me check that. If GCF is 7, then the other number would be (7 *7700)/350= (53900)/350=154. 154 is not an option, but perhaps I'm just grasping at straws now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should pick the option that gives the correct product, even if the GCF is wrong. But that's not a good approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the initial formula.\n\nWait, another approach: if the GCF is 11, then both numbers can be expressed as 11*a and 11*b, where a and b are coprime (their GCF is 1).\n\nSo the two numbers are 11a and 11b. Their LCM is 11*a*b because since a and b are coprime, LCM(11a,11b)=11ab.\n\nSo the problem states that LCM is 7700, so 11ab=7700 \u2192 ab=700.\n\nOne of the numbers is 350, which is 11a or 11b. But 350 must be divisible by 11, which it isn't. So this is impossible. Therefore, the problem is incorrect, but the options are given.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is 242, even though the GCF is 2. But that doesn't fit the problem's condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but that's not what's stated. So I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the other number to be 308, which gives the correct LCM but incorrect GCF. So perhaps the correct answer is B)308, but that's not what the problem says.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. I think I made a mistake earlier in the approach. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let's compute the product 350 * x =11 *7700=84700.\n\nSo x=84700/350=242.\n\nSo x is 242.\n\nNow, check if the GCF of 350 and 242 is 11.\n\n350 factors: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242 factors: 2 *11^2.\n\nThe common factors are 2. So GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nThus, the problem is impossible as stated. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but since that's not possible, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, and the other number is 242. So the answer would be A)242.\n\nBut the problem says GCF is 11, which makes this impossible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but I have to choose the option that fits the product, even if it doesn't fit the GCF condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the option where the product of 350 and the option is 84700, which is 11 *7700.\n\nSo 350 * x =84700 \u2192 x=242, which is option A.\n\nBut that doesn't fit the GCF condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 11, but one of the numbers is 350, which isn't a multiple of 11, making this impossible. So perhaps the answer is none of the options, but that's not given.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just go back to the initial formula and proceed.\n\nThe other number is 242, but the GCF is 2. So the problem is incorrect, but perhaps the intended answer is A)242.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the LCM of 350 and 242.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\n242=2*11^2.\n\nSo LCM is 2*5^2*7*11^2=2*25*7*121=2*25=50; 50*7=350; 350*121=42350. Which is way higher than 7700. So that's not correct.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since the options are given, I must choose the best possible one.\n\nWait, let me recheck option B:308.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\n308=2^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo LCM is 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11=4*25=100; 100*7=700; 700*11=7700. So LCM is correct.\n\nGCF is 2*7=14.\n\nSo the problem states GCF is 11, but it's 14 here. So no.\n\nBut perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 14, and the answer is B)308. But the problem says GCF is 11, so that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem says the GCF is 11, and the LCM is 7700. One number is 350. So the other number is 242, which doesn't have the correct GCF. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but the intended answer is A)242.\n\nSo after all this, perhaps the answer is A)242.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves finding the other integer when given that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350. The relationship between GCF and LCM is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\na \\cdot b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\cdot \\text{LCM}(a, b)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 350\\), \\(\\text{GCF}(a, b) = 11\\), and \\(\\text{LCM}(a, b) = 7700\\). Substituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n350 \\cdot b = 11 \\cdot 7700\n\\]\n\n\\[\n350 \\cdot b = 84700\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(b\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{84700}{350} = 242\n\\]\n\nThus, the other integer is 242. However, the problem states that the GCF of the two integers is 11. To verify this, the prime factorizations of 350 and 242 are:\n\n\\[\n350 = 2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7\n\\]\n\\[\n242 = 2 \\cdot 11^2\n\\]\n\nThe GCF is the product of the smallest powers of the common prime factors. The only common prime factor is 2, so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(350, 242) = 2\n\\]\n\nThis contradicts the problem's condition that the GCF is 11. Therefore, 242 does not satisfy the GCF requirement. Despite this, the formula calculation suggests that 242 is the other integer. Given the constraints of the problem and the options provided, the answer must be **242**.\n\nANSWER: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the other integer when given the greatest common factor (GCF) and the least common multiple (LCM). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe question says that the GCF of two positive integers is 11, and their LCM is 7700. One of the integers is 350, and I need to find the other. The options are A)242, B)308, C)352, D)412, E)456.\n\nWait, I remember there's a formula that relates GCF and LCM of two numbers. Oh right! The product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So, if the two numbers are a and b, then a * b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b).\n\nRight, so let me apply that here. Let's denote the two integers as a and b. We know a is 350, so 350 * b = 11 * 7700. Let me compute the right side first.\n\n11 multiplied by 7700. Let's see, 7700 divided by 11 is 700, because 11 * 700 is 7700. So 11 * 7700 would be 7700 * 11. Wait, no, that's the same as 7700 * 11. Let me calculate that. 7700 * 10 is 77,000, plus another 7700 is 84,700. So the product a*b is 84,700.\n\nSo 350 * b = 84,700. To find b, I divide both sides by 350. Let's do that: b = 84,700 / 350.\n\nHmm, let me compute that. 350 goes into 84,700 how many times? Well, 350 * 200 is 70,000. Subtracting that from 84,700 gives 14,700. 350 * 40 is 14,000, so that leaves 700. 350 * 2 is 700. So adding those together: 200 + 40 + 2 = 242. So b is 242. Oh wait, but 242 is option A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. I should check if that makes sense with the GCF being 11. Because sometimes, just because the product fits, the GCF might not match.\n\nSo, the two numbers are 350 and 242. Let's find their GCF.\n\nFirst, factor both numbers into primes.\n\n350: Let's break it down. 350 = 35 * 10 = (5*7) * (2*5) = 2 * 5^2 * 7.\n\n242: 242 divided by 2 is 121. 121 is 11 squared. So 242 = 2 * 11^2.\n\nSo the prime factors of 350 are 2, 5, 5, 7. For 242, they are 2, 11, 11.\n\nThe GCF is the product of the smallest power of all common primes. The common prime here is 2. Both have at least one 2. So GCF is 2. But wait, the problem states the GCF is 11, not 2. Oh no, that's a problem. That means I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, so my initial calculation gave me 242, but that doesn't have GCF 11 with 350. So that can't be the correct answer. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me go back. The formula says a*b = GCF * LCM. So 350 * b = 11 *7700. So 11 *7700 is 84,700. 84,700 divided by 350 is indeed 242. So mathematically, that's correct. But since the GCF isn't 11, I must have a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me double-check the formula. Oh wait, the formula is correct: product equals GCF multiplied by LCM. So the calculation is correct. So why is the GCF coming out as 2 instead of 11?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the GCF of 350 and 242. Let me check that again. 350 is 2 *5^2 *7. 242 is 2 *11^2. So the common factors are only 2. So GCF is 2, not 11. That contradicts the problem statement, which says the GCF is 11.\n\nSo that means that 242 can't be the correct answer. Therefore, I must have done something wrong. But according to the formula, it's 242. So what's the issue here?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again. Let me denote the two numbers as a and b. a is 350, and GCF(a,b)=11. So a must be a multiple of 11, right? Because the GCF is 11.\n\nWait, 350 divided by 11. Let me check: 11*31 is 341, 11*32 is 352. So 350 is between 341 and 352, meaning it's not a multiple of 11. Oh no! So 350 is not a multiple of 11. But the GCF of 350 and the other number is 11, which implies that both numbers must be multiples of 11. Because GCF is the greatest common factor, so 11 must divide both numbers.\n\nWait, but 350 is not a multiple of 11. That's a problem. Because if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818, which is not an integer. So that's impossible. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, wait. Is there a mistake in the problem statement? Because if one of the numbers is 350, and the GCF is 11, then 350 must be divisible by 11, but it's not. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating whether 350 is divisible by 11.\n\nLet me check: 11 times 31 is 341, and 341 plus 11 is 352. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. So that can't be. So how is this possible? Because the problem states that the GCF is 11. So either I'm misunderstanding the problem or I'm missing something.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I should re-examine the problem. It says, the greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. One of the integers is 350. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, because 11 is a common factor.\n\nBut 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So that's a contradiction. That suggests that the problem has no solution, but that's not possible because the options are given. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated 350 divided by 11. Let me compute 11*31. 31*10 is 310, 31*1 is 31, so 341. 341 plus 11 is 352. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. So how can the GCF be 11?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something here. The GCF is 11, which must divide both numbers. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't, which suggests that the problem is flawed, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me write the two numbers as a = 11 * m and b = 11 * n, where m and n are integers such that their GCF is 1, because 11 is the highest common factor. Because if m and n had a common factor greater than 1, then the GCF would be higher than 11.\n\nSo a = 11m, b = 11n, and GCF(m,n)=1.\n\nThe LCM of a and b is given as 7700. But the LCM of a and b is equal to (a*b)/GCF(a,b) = (11m *11n)/11 = 11 * m *n. Because GCF(a,b)=11.\n\nSo 11 * m *n = 7700.\n\nSo m *n = 7700 /11 = 700.\n\nSo m and n are two integers with GCF 1, and their product is 700.\n\nWe know that a is 350. So a =11m =350. So 11m =350 \u2192 m=350/11. Let's compute that: 350 \u00f7 11. 11*31=341, so 350-341=9. So m=31.818... which is not an integer. That can't be right because m has to be an integer.\n\nWait a minute, this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem because a is 350, which isn't a multiple of 11, but the GCF is 11, which requires that a is a multiple of 11. So this is impossible. But the problem gives options, so perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try a different approach. Let me represent the two numbers as a=350 and b= x, where GCF(350, x)=11, and LCM(350, x)=7700.\n\nWe know that 350 can be written as 2 * 5^2 *7.\n\nWe also know that GCF(350, x)=11. But 350 doesn't have 11 as a factor. Therefore, this is impossible because the GCF can't have a prime factor that neither number has. So that's a problem. Because 350 doesn't have 11 as a factor, the GCF cannot be 11.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the problem states that the GCF is 11. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but that's unlikely. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the GCF must be a factor of both numbers. Oh wait, that's correct. So if the GCF is 11, both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But 350 is not. So this is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since it's given, I must have made a mistake. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says the GCF is 11, but 350 is not a multiple of 11, which would make this impossible. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's not possible. So perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, let me recheck the problem statement. The question says the GCF is 11, and one of the integers is 350. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem is incorrect, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the formula. The product of the two numbers is GCF multiplied by LCM. So 350 * x = 11 *7700. Which is 350x = 84,700 \u2192 x=84,700/350= 242. But 242 and 350 have a GCF of 2, not 11. So that can't be.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrect. But since this is a multiple-choice question, I must choose one of the options. Let me check each option to see which one, when paired with 350, has a GCF of 11 and an LCM of 7700.\n\nLet's test each option:\n\nOption A: 242. As before, GCF(350,242)=2, which is wrong.\n\nOption B: 308. Let's compute GCF(350,308). Let's factor both.\n\n350: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n308: Let's see, 308 divided by 2 is 154. 154 divided by 2 is 77. 77 is 7*11. So 308 = 2^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo the common factors between 350 and 308 are 2 and 7. So GCF is 2*7=14. That's higher than 11, so no.\n\nOption C:352. Let's factor 352.\n\n352: 32 * 11. 32 is 2^5. So 352=2^5 *11.\n\n350 is 2*5^2*7.\n\nCommon factors: only 2. So GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nOption D:412. Let's factor 412.\n\n412 divided by 2 is 206. 206 divided by 2 is 103. 103 is a prime. So 412=2^2 *103.\n\n350 is 2*5^2*7.\n\nCommon factors: only 2. GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nOption E:456. Let's factor 456.\n\n456 divided by 2 is 228. 228 divided by 2 is 114. 114 divided by 2 is 57. 57 is 3*19. So 456=2^3 *3 *19.\n\n350 is 2*5^2*7.\n\nCommon factors: 2. So GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nWait, none of the options have a GCF of 11 with 350. That suggests that the problem is flawed, but that's unlikely. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that the product a*b = GCF * LCM. Let me double-check that formula. Yes, I'm pretty sure that's correct: a*b = GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b).\n\nSo if the formula is correct, and the given data is correct, then the other number must be 242. But that doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I factorized the numbers.\n\nWait, let me check 350 and 242 again. 350 is 2 *5^2 *7. 242 is 2 *11^2. So the GCF is 2. But the problem says it's 11. So that's a problem. So perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula a*b = GCF * LCM applies when the two numbers are co-prime. No, no, the formula holds for any two positive integers. So that's not the issue.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in the problem statement. Maybe the LCM is 7700 and the GCF is 11, but one of the numbers is 350. So let's compute the other number.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me denote the two numbers as a=350 and b. Their GCF is 11. So 11 divides both a and b. But 350 isn't divisible by 11, which is a problem. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the factors.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong in thinking that 350 isn't divisible by 11. Let me compute 350 \u00f711.\n\n11 * 31 = 341. 341 +11=352. So 350 is 31*11=341, plus 9. So 350 is not a multiple of 11. So this is a problem.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is incorrectly set. But the options are given, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the other number using the formula, even though the GCF seems to not match. Because according to the formula, the other number is 242. But that doesn't have GCF 11 with 350. So perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the GCF again. 350=2*5^2*7. 242=2*11^2.\n\nThe common prime factors are just 2, so GCF is 2. So that's correct. So the problem is impossible as stated, because 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So none of the options would work.\n\nBut the options are given, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should pick the option that gives the correct product, even if the GCF isn't 11. But that's not logical.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says the GCF is 11, but the numbers are 350 and 242, which have GCF 2. So the problem is wrong. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but that's not what's stated.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the LCM is 7700, but the GCF is 2. Let me check what would happen then.\n\nIf GCF is 2, then using the formula: 350 * b = 2 *7700=15400. So b=15400/350=44. But 44 isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 7. Let's see: 350 *b=7*7700=53900 \u2192 b=53900/350=154. 154 is not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 5. Then 350*b=5*7700=38,500 \u2192 b=38500/350=110. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the other number to be 242, but the GCF is 2. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. But the options are given, so perhaps I have to choose option A, 242.\n\nBut that's not correct because the GCF is 2, not 11. So I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says the GCF is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. So the other number must be a multiple of 11. Let me check the options to see which one is a multiple of 11.\n\nOption A:242. 242 divided by 11 is 22, so yes.\n\nOption B:308. 308/11 is 28, yes.\n\nOption C:352. 352/11 is 32, yes.\n\nOption D:412. 412/11 is approximately 37.45, so no.\n\nOption E:456. 456/11 is about 41.45, so no.\n\nSo options A, B, C are multiples of 11.\n\nSo perhaps I should check which of these, when paired with 350, gives an LCM of 7700.\n\nBecause the problem says the LCM is 7700.\n\nSo let's compute the LCM of 350 and each option.\n\nOption A:242.\n\nWe can compute LCM(350,242). First, find the prime factors.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\n242=2*11^2.\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present: 2^1,5^2,7^1,11^2.\n\nSo LCM is 2 *25 *7 * 121.\n\nCompute that: 2*25=50; 50*7=350; 350*121=42,350.\n\nWhich is much larger than 7700. So that's not the answer.\n\nOption B:308.\n\n308 is 2^2 *7 *11.\n\n350 is 2 *5^2 *7.\n\nLCM is 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nCompute that: 4 *25=100; 100 *7=700; 700 *11=7700.\n\nAh! So the LCM of 350 and 308 is 7700, which matches the problem's condition.\n\nAdditionally, the GCF of 350 and 308.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\n308=2^2 *7 *11.\n\nCommon factors: 2^1 and 7^1. So GCF is 2*7=14. But the problem states the GCF is 11. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the GCF is 11, but in this case, it's 14. So that can't be the correct option.\n\nHmm, but the LCM is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation.\n\nWait, 350 and 308.\n\n350's factors: 2,5,5,7.\n\n308's factors: 2,2,7,11.\n\nSo the GCF is the product of the minimum exponents of the common primes. Common primes are 2 and 7.\n\nSo 2^1 and 7^1. So GCF is 2*7=14. So that's correct. So the problem's condition for GCF is 11, which isn't met here. So option B is out.\n\nOption C:352.\n\n352 is 2^5 *11.\n\n350 is 2*5^2*7.\n\nSo LCM is 2^5 *5^2 *7 *11.\n\nCompute that: 32 *25=800; 800 *7=5600; 5600 *11=61,600. Which is way larger than 7700. So not the option.\n\nSo none of the options meet both conditions. Wait, but option B met the LCM condition but not the GCF.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial formula was applied correctly, but the problem requires that the other number is 242, even though it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. So perhaps the answer is option A.\n\nBut that can't be because the GCF would be 2, not 11. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended that the GCF is 11, and the LCM is 7700, but one of the numbers is 350. So the other number must be (11 *7700)/350 = (84700)/350 = 242. But then the GCF is 2, which doesn't fit. So perhaps the problem is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 14, but that's not what's stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the LCM for option B. Let me recheck.\n\nFor option B, 308.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\n308=2^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo the LCM would be the product of the highest exponents: 2^2,5^2,7^1,11^1.\n\nSo 4 *25 =100, *7=700, *11=7700. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the LCM is correct, but the GCF is 14, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but since the problem requires it, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem states that the GCF is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11, which it isn't. So this suggests that the problem is impossible as stated. But the options are given, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem actually meant that the GCF is 7, not 11. Let me check that. If GCF is 7, then the other number would be (7 *7700)/350= (53900)/350=154. 154 is not an option, but perhaps I'm just grasping at straws now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should pick the option that gives the correct product, even if the GCF is wrong. But that's not a good approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the initial formula.\n\nWait, another approach: if the GCF is 11, then both numbers can be expressed as 11*a and 11*b, where a and b are coprime (their GCF is 1).\n\nSo the two numbers are 11a and 11b. Their LCM is 11*a*b because since a and b are coprime, LCM(11a,11b)=11ab.\n\nSo the problem states that LCM is 7700, so 11ab=7700 \u2192 ab=700.\n\nOne of the numbers is 350, which is 11a or 11b. But 350 must be divisible by 11, which it isn't. So this is impossible. Therefore, the problem is incorrect, but the options are given.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is 242, even though the GCF is 2. But that doesn't fit the problem's condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, but that's not what's stated. So I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the other number to be 308, which gives the correct LCM but incorrect GCF. So perhaps the correct answer is B)308, but that's not what the problem says.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. I think I made a mistake earlier in the approach. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let's compute the product 350 * x =11 *7700=84700.\n\nSo x=84700/350=242.\n\nSo x is 242.\n\nNow, check if the GCF of 350 and 242 is 11.\n\n350 factors: 2 *5^2 *7.\n\n242 factors: 2 *11^2.\n\nThe common factors are 2. So GCF is 2, not 11.\n\nThus, the problem is impossible as stated. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but since that's not possible, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 2, and the other number is 242. So the answer would be A)242.\n\nBut the problem says GCF is 11, which makes this impossible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but I have to choose the option that fits the product, even if it doesn't fit the GCF condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the option where the product of 350 and the option is 84700, which is 11 *7700.\n\nSo 350 * x =84700 \u2192 x=242, which is option A.\n\nBut that doesn't fit the GCF condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 11, but one of the numbers is 350, which isn't a multiple of 11, making this impossible. So perhaps the answer is none of the options, but that's not given.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just go back to the initial formula and proceed.\n\nThe other number is 242, but the GCF is 2. So the problem is incorrect, but perhaps the intended answer is A)242.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the LCM of 350 and 242.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\n242=2*11^2.\n\nSo LCM is 2*5^2*7*11^2=2*25*7*121=2*25=50; 50*7=350; 350*121=42350. Which is way higher than 7700. So that's not correct.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since the options are given, I must choose the best possible one.\n\nWait, let me recheck option B:308.\n\n350=2*5^2*7.\n\n308=2^2 *7 *11.\n\nSo LCM is 2^2 *5^2 *7 *11=4*25=100; 100*7=700; 700*11=7700. So LCM is correct.\n\nGCF is 2*7=14.\n\nSo the problem states GCF is 11, but it's 14 here. So no.\n\nBut perhaps the problem intended the GCF to be 14, and the answer is B)308. But the problem says GCF is 11, so that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem says the GCF is 11, and the LCM is 7700. One number is 350. So the other number is 242, which doesn't have the correct GCF. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but the intended answer is A)242.\n\nSo after all this, perhaps the answer is A)242.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the other integer when given that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350. The relationship between GCF and LCM is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\na \\cdot b = \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\cdot \\text{LCM}(a, b)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 350\\), \\(\\text{GCF}(a, b) = 11\\), and \\(\\text{LCM}(a, b) = 7700\\). Substituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n350 \\cdot b = 11 \\cdot 7700\n\\]\n\n\\[\n350 \\cdot b = 84700\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(b\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{84700}{350} = 242\n\\]\n\nThus, the other integer is 242. However, the problem states that the GCF of the two integers is 11. To verify this, the prime factorizations of 350 and 242 are:\n\n\\[\n350 = 2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7\n\\]\n\\[\n242 = 2 \\cdot 11^2\n\\]\n\nThe GCF is the product of the smallest powers of the common prime factors. The only common prime factor is 2, so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(350, 242) = 2\n\\]\n\nThis contradicts the problem's condition that the GCF is 11. Therefore, 242 does not satisfy the GCF requirement. Despite this, the formula calculation suggests that 242 is the other integer. Given the constraints of the problem and the options provided, the answer must be **242**.\n\nANSWER: A",
