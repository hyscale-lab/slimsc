      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a computer routine that generates two numbers, x and y. The first number, x, is a random number between 0 and 100, inclusive. The second number, y, has to be less than or equal to the square root of x. I need to figure out which pair of numbers doesn't satisfy this condition. The options are A through E, each with different (x, y) pairs.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: (99,10). So x is 99, and y is 10. What's the square root of 99? Hmm, I know that 10 squared is 100, so the square root of 99 is just a bit less than 10. Let me calculate it roughly. 9.949, maybe? So y is 10. But wait, the condition is y \u2264 sqrt(x). Since sqrt(99) is about 9.949, which is less than 10, that means y is 10 which is greater than sqrt(99). So this pair should not satisfy the condition. Wait, but is that correct? Because if x is 99, y can be up to 9.949, so 10 is too big. So A would be an invalid pair, meaning it's the answer. But wait, let me check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption B: (85,9). Let's compute sqrt(85). 9^2 is 81, 10^2 is 100. So sqrt(85) is between 9 and 10. Let me see, 9.21 maybe? Because 9.2 squared is 84.64, and 9.21 squared is about 84.8. So y is 9, which is less than 9.21. So that's okay. So B is valid.\n\nOption C: (50,7). Square root of 50 is approximately 7.07. So y is 7, which is less than 7.07. So that works. C is valid.\n\nOption D: (1,1). sqrt(1) is exactly 1. So y is 1, which is equal to sqrt(x). So that's acceptable. D is valid.\n\nOption E: (1,0). sqrt(1) is 1, and y is 0. 0 is less than 1, so that's fine. E is valid.\n\nWait, but wait. Looking back at option A: x is 99, y is 10. The square root of 99 is about 9.949, so y=10 is more than that. So y must be less than or equal to sqrt(x), so 10 is not allowed. So A is the pair that doesn't satisfy the condition. Therefore, the answer is A.\n",
