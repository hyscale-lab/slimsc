      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Julie's yard. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So, the yard is rectangular, right? And one of the sides is 100 feet wide. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, right, a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides. So if one side is 100 feet, then the opposite side is also 100 feet. But the question is asking about the other side, so the one that's not 100 feet.\n\nThe total area is given as 3,000 square feet. Oh, right, area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying length and width. So area equals length multiplied by width. But wait, in this case, which one is which? Oh, wait, sometimes people refer to the longer side as length and the shorter as width, but in this problem, they say one side is 100 feet wide. So maybe that's the width.\n\nWait, the question is about the length of the other side. So let's think. Let's say the width is 100 feet. Then the other dimension, which would be the length, is what we need to find. Because area is length times width, so 3000 equals length times 100.\n\nSo solving for length: length equals area divided by width. So 3000 divided by 100 is 30. So the length would be 30 feet. Looking at the options, option A is 30 feet. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I get the sides right? Because sometimes, in some contexts, the longer side is called the length, but here, the problem says one side is 100 feet wide. Oh, but wait, 100 feet is a pretty long width. Let me think again. If the area is 3000, and one side is 100, then 3000/100 is 30. So the other side is 30 feet. That seems correct. So the options are A)30, E)60, etc. So yeah, A is the right choice.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the length of the other side of Julie's rectangular yard, we start by noting that the area of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}\n\\]\n\nThe problem states that one side of the yard is 100 feet wide, and the total area is 3,000 square feet.

One side is 100 feet wide, and the total area is 3,000 square feet. I need to find the length of the other side. \n\nWait, rectangular yards... right, so a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides. So if one side is 100 feet, the opposite side is also 100 feet. The other two sides are the same length, which I need to find. \n\nThe area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. Oh wait, but sometimes people get confused about which is which. But in this case, I think it doesn't matter which is length or width since they're just two sides. So the formula is area = side1 \u00d7 side2. \n\nGiven that the area is 3,000 sq ft, and one side is 100 ft, I can set up the equation. Let's call the unknown side 'x'. So 100 * x = 3,000. \n\nTo find x, I can divide both sides by 100. So x = 3,000 / 100. Let me calculate that. 3,000 divided by 100 is 30. So x is 30 feet. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 30 feet. That should be the answer. Let me just double-check. 100 ft multiplied by 30 ft gives 3,000 sq ft, which matches the given area.
