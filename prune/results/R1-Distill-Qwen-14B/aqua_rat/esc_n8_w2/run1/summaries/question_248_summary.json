      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where John is making 3-letter codes. The conditions are a bit specific, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the question. The codes are three letters long. The vowels available are 5, and consonants are 20. The middle letter must be a vowel, and the first and third letters must be different consonants. Oh wait, wait\u2014so the first letter is a consonant, the middle is a vowel, and the third is also a consonant, but they can't be the same as each other.\n\nSo the structure is: consonant (C1) - vowel (V) - consonant (C2), where C1 and C2 are different.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the number of possible codes. It's a combinatorics problem, so I'll approach it by considering each position separately and then multiply the possibilities.\n\nThe middle letter is a vowel. There are 5 vowels, so for the middle position, I have 5 choices.\n\nNow the first letter: it's a consonant. There are 20 consonants. So for the first letter, 20 options.\n\nThe third letter is also a consonant, but it must be different from the first. So after choosing the first consonant, the third can't be the same. So for the third letter, how many options? Well, since the first took one consonant, the third has 19 left.\n\nWait, but does the problem say that all consonants are different? No, I think each code is a sequence, so letters can be repeated unless specified otherwise. But wait, the condition says the first and third letters must be different. So repetition is not allowed between C1 and C2.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nNumber of codes = (number of choices for first consonant) \u00d7 (number of vowels) \u00d7 (number of choices for third consonant that's different from first).\n\nSo that would be 20 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 19.\n\nLet me calculate that. 20 times 5 is 100. 100 times 19 is 1900.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 1900. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes these problems have a twist.\n\nWait, could the third letter be any consonant except the first? Yes, because the condition is that the first and third are different. So the third has 19 options. So yes, 20 * 5 * 19 = 1900.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 1,980\nB)2,020\nC)2,100\nD)2,200\nE)1,900\n\nSo E is 1900. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Are there any other constraints? The problem states that the code is made with different vowels and consonants\u2014wait, no, the problem says \"diffenrent 5 vowels and 20 consonants\" (probably a typo, but the way it's written, maybe they're distinct sets). So each code uses one vowel and two consonants, which are different.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be E) 1900.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the number of 3-letter codes John can make, we analyze the constraints and structure of the problem:\n\n1. **Structure of the code**: The code consists of three letters, where the middle letter must be a vowel, and the first and third letters must be consonants that are different from each other.\n\n2. **Choices for the middle letter**: There are 5 vowels available for the middle position.
