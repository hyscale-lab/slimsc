      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Roy has this problem with severe headaches and goes to the doctor. The doctor gives him five tablets and tells him to take one every 15 minutes. I need to figure out how long it'll take him to consume all five. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nWait, so he takes one tablet every 15 minutes. But wait, when does he start? Like, does he take the first tablet immediately, and then the next ones every 15 minutes after that? Or does the first tablet count as the starting point?\n\nLet's think. Suppose the first tablet is taken at time zero. Then the next one at 15 minutes, then 30, 45, 60, and so on. But wait, he has five tablets to take. So how many intervals are there between them?\n\nIf he takes the first one right away, then the second is 15 minutes later, third 30, fourth 45, fifth 60. Wait, no, that can't be right because with five tablets, the intervals would be four 15-minute gaps. Because the first is at 0, then four more each 15 minutes. So let me calculate that.\n\nThe first tablet: time 0.\nSecond: 15 min.\nThird: 30 min.\nFourth: 45 min.\nFifth: 60 min.\n\nSo the total time from the first to the fifth is 60 minutes. But wait, does that mean it takes an hour to take all five? Because the fifth is taken at 60 minutes. But wait, the question is about how much time it takes to consume all five. So if the first is at 0, the fifth is at 60, so the total time from start to finish is 60 minutes. That would be option E, 60 minutes.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me recount. Five tablets: 1,2,3,4,5. The time between each is 15 minutes. So how many intervals are there? Between 1 and 2 is one interval, 2-3 another, etc. So for five tablets, there are four intervals. So 4 * 15 is 60 minutes. So yes, total time is 60 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think is, the first tablet is taken at time zero, and each subsequent one is 15 minutes after the previous. So tablet 1: 0, tablet 2:15, tablet3:30, tablet4:45, tablet5:60. So the last tablet is taken at 60 minutes, meaning the total time taken is 60 minutes. So the answer should be E)60 Min.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Does the time include the last tablet? So for example, if you start at time zero, then after 15 minutes, you've taken two. So for five tablets, how many 15-minute intervals? Let's see:\n\nNumber of intervals = number of tablets - 1.\n\nSo 5 tablets: 5-1=4 intervals. Each interval 15 mins. 4*15=60. So yes, 60 minutes.\n\nAnother way: imagine you have two tablets. You take the first at time 0, the second at 15. Total time is 15 minutes. So 2 tablets take 15 mins. 3 tablets would take 30 mins, because 3-1=2 intervals, 2*15=30. So five tablets: 4*15=60. So the answer is E.\n",

The question is asking how long it'll take him to take all five tablets. Hmm, let's break it down.\n\nSo the doctor told him to take one tablet every 15 minutes. Wait, but how many times does he need to take it? Well, he has five tablets, right? So he needs to take each one at 15-minute intervals.\n\nWait, wait, but the timing. Let me think. If he takes the first tablet right away, like at time zero, then the next one would be at 15 minutes, then another at 30, then 45, then 60. Wait, does that make five? Let me count: 1st at 0, 2nd at 15, 3rd at 30, 4th at 45, and 5th at 60. So that's five times, right? So the last tablet is taken at 60 minutes. But the question is how much time does it take to consume all five. So the time starts when he takes the first one, and ends when he takes the fifth.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. If he takes the first tablet immediately, then the time between the first and the last is the time to take all five. So the first is at 0, then each subsequent every 15 minutes. So the intervals are 15 minutes each. For five tablets, how many intervals are there between them?\n\nLet's see. Between tablet 1 and 2: 15 min. 2 to 3: another 15. 3 to 4: another, and 4 to 5: another. So that's four intervals of 15 minutes each. So 4 *15=60 minutes. So the total time from the first to the last is 60 minutes.\n\nBut wait, the question is how much time will it take to consume all five. So from the first to the fifth, it's 60 minutes. So the answer should be 60 minutes, which is option E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. Each tablet is taken every 15 minutes. So for five tablets, how many doses are spaced 15 minutes apart.\n\nWait, the first tablet is taken at time zero. Then each next tablet is 15 minutes after the previous. So for five tablets, the time taken is (5-1)*15 = 60 minutes. So yeah, 60 minutes is the total time from the first to the last dose.\n\nSo the answer should be E)60 Min.\n",
