      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says that in a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs they liked best. Each song was selected 5 times. How many students were surveyed? The options are A)96, B)48, C)32, D)25, E)18.\n\nHmm, so each student picks two songs. And each song is picked a total of five times across all students. I need to find out how many students there were.\n\nLet me break it down. Each student contributes 2 song selections. So if there are N students, the total number of song selections is 2*N. Because each student chooses two songs.\n\nNow, each of the 10 songs was selected 5 times. So the total number of selections is 10 songs * 5 selections each = 50 selections.\n\nSo, 2*N = 50. Because the total selections from the students must equal the total selections each song received summed up.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So if 2N equals 50, then N is 25. Because 2 times 25 is 50.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 25. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Suppose there are 25 students. Each picks 2 songs, so 25*2=50 total song choices. Each song is chosen 5 times, so 10 songs *5=50. Yep, that adds up. So 25 is correct.\n",

The question is about a survey where each student picks their top two songs from a list of 10. Each song was selected 5 times, and I need to find out how many students were surveyed. Hmm.\n\nAlright, so let me break it down. Each student selects 2 songs. So for each student, they contribute 2 song selections. If there are, say, N students, then the total number of song selections would be 2*N, right? Because each student adds two to the total count.\n\nWait, but the problem says each song was selected 5 times. There are 10 songs in total. So each of these 10 songs was picked 5 times. So the total number of song selections across all students would be 10 songs multiplied by 5 selections each. Let me calculate that: 10 *5 =50. So the total number of song choices is 50.\n\nBut wait, each student contributes 2 song choices, so the total is also 2 times the number of students. Let me represent the number of students as S. So 2*S = 50. Solving for S, I get S=50/2=25. Oh, so 25 students.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Each student picks exactly 2 songs, and each of the 10 songs is picked exactly 5 times. So the total selections are 10*5=50. Since each student makes 2 selections, the number of students is 50/2=25. Yeah, that seems to add up.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 25. So the answer should be D.\n",
