      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a map scale, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe question states that on a map, the distance from Town F to Town G is measured as 20 inches. Then it says that on this map, 1/4 inch represents an actual distance of 10 miles. The question is asking for the actual distance in miles between these two towns.\n\nHmm, I remember that map scales are about converting distances on the map to real-life distances. So I think I need to find out how many real miles each inch on the map corresponds to.\n\nWait, the scale is 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. Oh, right, so each 1/4 inch on the map is 10 miles in reality. But how do I find out how many miles one inch represents? Maybe I can calculate that.\n\nIf 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then one inch would be four times that, because 1/4 is a quarter. So 10 miles multiplied by 4 equals 40 miles per inch. Let me write that down: 1 inch = 40 miles.\n\nNow, the measured distance on the map between Town F and G is 20 inches. So to find the actual distance, I should multiply the number of inches by the miles per inch.\n\nSo 20 inches multiplied by 40 miles per inch. Let me do that math: 20 * 40 = 800 miles. Oh, so that would be 800 miles in real life.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The scale is 1/4 inch = 10 miles. So for each 1/4 inch, it's 10 miles. So for 1 inch, which is four times as long, it's 4 * 10 = 40 miles. Right, that makes sense.\n\nSo the map distance is 20 inches. So actual distance is 20 * 40. 20 times 40 is 800. So the answer should be 800 miles.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 800. So I think the correct answer is A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the actual distance between Town F and Town G, we start by understanding the scale of the map.

I need to find the actual distance in miles.\n\nWait, so the scale is 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. That means for every quarter inch on the map, it's 10 miles in real life. So, if I have 20 inches on the map, how much is that in real distance?\n\nLet me break it down. First, I can find out how many quarter inches are in 20 inches. Since one quarter is 0.25 inches, I can divide 20 by 0.25 to find the number of units. Wait, 20 divided by 0.25 is the same as 20 multiplied by 4, right? Because 1 divided by 0.25 is 4. So 20 * 4 is 80. So there are 80 quarter inches in 20 inches.\n\nEach quarter inch is 10 miles, so 80 of them would be 80 times 10 miles. Let me calculate that. 80 * 10 is 800 miles. So the actual distance should be 800 miles.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another way to approach it is to find out how many miles per inch. Since 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then one inch would be 10 miles divided by 1/4, which is the same as 10 *4 = 40 miles per inch. So each inch on the map is 40 miles. Then, 20 inches would be 20 *40 = 800 miles. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo the options are A)800, B)720, etc. So the correct answer must be A)800.\n",
