      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again. Hmm, it says that when 30 is subtracted from a number, it's reduced to its one third. I need to find the value of 50% of that number. The options are A) 22.5, B) 84, C)21, D)24, E)25.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I think I should set up an equation based on the problem. Let me call the number 'x' because that's usually what we do. So, the problem says when we subtract 30 from x, it becomes one third of the original number. So the equation would be:\n\nx - 30 = (1/3)x\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because subtracting 30 reduces it to a third of itself. Now I need to solve for x. Let's rearrange the equation. Subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get all the x terms on one side.\n\nx - (1/3)x -30 =0\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's do it step by step. So, x minus 30 equals (1/3)x. So, I can subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get:\n\nx - (1/3)x -30 =0\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me try that again. Subtract (1/3)x from both sides:\n\nx - (1/3)x = 30\n\nAh, yes, because (x - 30) = (1/3)x, so moving (1/3)x to the left gives x - (1/3)x = 30.\n\nNow, x is the same as (3/3)x, so (3/3)x - (1/3)x is (2/3)x. So:\n\n(2/3)x =30\n\nTo solve for x, I can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (2/3), which is (3/2).\n\nx = 30 * (3/2)\n\nLet me calculate that. 30 times 3 is 90, divided by 2 is 45. So x is 45.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me double-check that. So 30 times 3 is 90, divided by 2 is indeed 45. So the original number is 45.\n\nNow the question asks for 50% of that number. 50% is the same as half, so I need to find half of 45.\n\nHalf of 45 is 22.5. So 50% of 45 is 22.5.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 22.5. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my steps. Let me go through it again quickly.\n\nProblem: x -30 = (1/3)x.\n\nSubtract (1/3)x: (2/3)x =30.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3/2: x=45.\n\nHalf of 45 is 22.5, which is option A.\n\nHmm, but looking at the options, option E is 25, which is close but not the same. Did I do something wrong? Let me check the initial equation again.\n\nWait, the problem says when 30 is subtracted from a number, it's reduced to its one third. So x -30 = (1/3)x. That's correct. So the steps are right.\n\nWait, another thought: Could the problem be interpreted differently? Like, maybe it's reduced to one third of its original value, but perhaps the wording is tricky. Let me read again.\n\n\"When 30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third.\" So, the number after subtracting 30 is a third of the original number. So the equation is correct.\n\nSo I think my answer is correct. The 50% is 22.5, so the answer should be option A.\n",

When we subtract 30 from this number, the result is equal to one third of the original number. So, mathematically, that translates to x - 30 = (1/3)x. That's the equation I need to solve to find the value of x.\n\nWait, let me write that down to visualize it better. So:\n\nx - 30 = (1/3)x\n\nHmm, how do I solve for x here?

Alternatively, I can bring all the x terms to one side. So, subtract (1/3)x from both sides:\n\nx - (1/3)x = 30\n\nYes, that looks better. Let me compute the left side. Since x is the same as (3/3)x, subtracting (1/3)x would give (2/3)x.\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n(2/3)x = 30\n\nTo solve for x, I can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (2/3), which is (3/2). Let's do that.\n\nx = 30 * (3/2)\n\nCalculating that, 30 divided by 2 is 15, multiplied by 3 is 45. So x equals 45.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me double-check that. If I subtract 30 from 45, I get 15. And one third of 45 is 15, right? Because 45 divided by 3 is 15. So yes, that checks out. So x is 45.\n\nBut the question isn't asking for x directly.

So that would be the correct answer. Let me just quickly check if I made any mistakes in my calculations.\n\nWait, another way to approach the initial equation: x - 30 = (1/3)x. Maybe I can get rid of the fraction by multiplying both sides by 3. Let's see:\n\n3*(x - 30) = x\n\nExpanding the left side: 3x - 90 = x\n\nSubtract x from both sides: 2x -90 =0 \u2192 2x=90 \u2192 x=45. Yep, same result.
