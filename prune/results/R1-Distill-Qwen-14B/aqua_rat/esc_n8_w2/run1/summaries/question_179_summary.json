      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the cost of gardening around a rectangular plot. Hmm, let's see. The problem says the boundary is 1 metre broad, the perimeter is 340 metres, and the rate is 10 per square metre. I need to find the cost.\n\nWait, wait. So the question is about the cost of gardening a 1-metre wide boundary around the plot. So I think that means I need to find the area of this boundary and then multiply by the rate to get the cost.\n\nBut how do I find the area of the boundary? I remember that when you have a border around a rectangle, the area can be found by subtracting the area of the inner rectangle from the area of the outer rectangle. But wait, since the border is 1 metre wide, the outer rectangle's dimensions would be increased by 1 metre on each side. So for a rectangle, the length and width each increase by 2 metres in total (1m on each side). Wait, no, actually, each dimension increases by 1m on one side and 1m on the other, so the length becomes L + 2 and the width becomes W + 2. So the area of the border would be (L+2)(W+2) - L*W.\n\nBut wait, I don't know the actual length and width of the plot, only the perimeter. The perimeter is 340 meters. For a rectangle, perimeter P = 2(L + W). So 2(L + W) = 340, which means L + W = 170. Hmm, but without knowing L and W individually, how can I find the area of the border?\n\nOh, wait, maybe there's another way. Let me think. The area of the border is the same as the perimeter multiplied by the width of the border, plus the area of the four corners. Because when you add a border around a rectangle, the area added is like a frame. So the area would be perimeter * width + 4*(width^2). Since the width is 1m, the area would be perimeter *1 + 4*(1)^2.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think. Imagine the border is 1m wide. The area would be the area of the larger rectangle (original plus 1m border all around) minus the original area. The larger rectangle has length L+2 and width W+2. So area is (L+2)(W+2) = LW + 2L + 2W +4. Original area is LW. So the area of the border is 2L + 2W +4. Which can be written as 2(L + W) +4. And since L + W is 170 (from perimeter), 2*170 +4= 340 +4= 344. So the area is 344 square meters.\n\nOh, right, because the perimeter is 340, which is 2(L+W)=340, so L+W=170. So 2*(170) is 340, plus 4, giving 344. Then multiply by the rate, which is 10 per square meter. So 344 *10=3440. \n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 3440. So the answer should be C.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: the area of the border can also be calculated as the perimeter multiplied by the width of the border plus the area added at the corners. So perimeter is 340, width is 1m. 340 *1=340, plus 4*(1)^2=4. So 340+4=344. Same result.\n\nSo the cost is 344 *10=3440. So the correct answer is C.\n",

I remember that the perimeter is given, and I need to find the area of the boundary, then multiply by the rate to get the cost. But wait, I'm a bit confused about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The plot is rectangular, and the perimeter is 340 meters. The boundary around it is 1 meter broad. So, I think this means there's a 1-meter wide strip all around the rectangle where the gardening is done. So, I need to find the area of this strip.\n\nWait, but how do I find the area of that strip? I remember that when you add a border around a shape, the area of the border is the area of the larger shape minus the area of the original shape. But in this case, the border is 1 meter wide. So, the larger shape would be a rectangle that's 1 meter wider on all sides.\n\nWait, no, actually, the original plot is the inner rectangle, and the boundary is the area that's 1 meter around it. So, the outer rectangle would have a length and width each increased by 2 meters. Because you add 1 meter on each side. For example, if the original length is L and width is W, the outer length is L+2 and width is W+2.\n\nSo, the area of the boundary (the strip) would be the area of the outer rectangle minus the area of the inner rectangle. So, area_boundary = (L+2)(W+2) - L*W. Let me expand that: (L*W + 2L + 2W +4) - L*W = 2L + 2W +4. So, the area is 2(L + W) +4. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nBut wait, the perimeter of the original plot is given. Perimeter P = 2(L + W) = 340. So, L + W = 340 / 2 = 170. Oh, right. So, substituting into the area_boundary equation: 2*(170) +4 = 340 +4 = 344 square meters.\n\nOh, wait, but wait a second. Because the perimeter is 340, so 2(L + W)=340, so L + W=170. So, the area of the boundary is 2(L+W) +4 = 2*170 +4 = 340 +4=344. So, the area is 344 m\u00b2.\n\nNow, the rate is 10 per square meter. So, the cost is 344 * 10 = 3440. Let me check the options. Option C is 3440. So, the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me think again. The area of the border is the outer area minus the inner area. The outer area is (L+2)(W+2) and inner is L*W. So, the difference is 2(L + W) +4. Which, since L + W is 170, gives 2*170 +4=344. Yep, that's right. So, cost is 344 *10=3440.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: The boundary is 1 meter wide, so it's like a frame around the rectangle. The area of such a frame can be thought of as the perimeter multiplied by the width of the frame, plus the corners. Wait, because when you add a border, each corner is a square of 1x1, and there are four of them. So, the area would be perimeter * width + 4*(width^2). But wait, in this case, width is 1, so 4*(1)=4.\n\nWait, but perimeter is 340, and width is 1. So, 340 *1 = 340. Adding 4 gives 344. Same as before. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the area is 344 m\u00b2, cost is 344 *10 =3440. So, the correct option is C.\n",
