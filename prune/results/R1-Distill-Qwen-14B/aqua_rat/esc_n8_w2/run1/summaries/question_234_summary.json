      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest, and I need to find the rate of interest per annum. Hmm, let's see what the problem says.\n\nAlright, the professor borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university. So the principal amount, P, is 5000. Then, after 3 years, the university got Rs. 300 on interest. Wait, wait. So the interest earned over three years is 300. I think I remember the formula for simple interest is something like I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is principal, R is the rate of interest per annum, and T is time in years.\n\nSo the formula is I = (P \u00d7 R \u00d7 T)/100. Oh wait, right, because the rate is a percentage. So let me plug in the numbers.\n\nI have I = 300, P =5000, T=3. I need to find R. So rearranging the formula to solve for R: R = (I \u00d7 100) / (P \u00d7 T).\n\nPlugging in the numbers: R = (300 \u00d7 100) / (5000 \u00d7 3). Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 5000 multiplied by 3 is 15,000. Then, 300 multiplied by 100 is 30,000. So R is 30,000 divided by 15,000. Wait, 30,000 divided by 15,000 is 2. So R is 2% per annum. \n\nLet me check the options. Option A is 2%, so that should be the answer. But wait, did I do that right? Let me recalculate.\n\n300 is the interest over 3 years. So simple interest is calculated each year on the original principal. So each year, the interest would be (5000 * R * 1)/100. So for three years, it's 3 times that. So 3*(5000 * R)/100 = 300. So 3*(5000R) = 300 * 100. 3*(5000R) = 30,000. Divide both sides by 3: 5000 R = 10,000. Then R = 10,000 /5000 = 2. Yep, same result. So the rate is 2%, which is option A. So I think the answer is A.\n",

Hmm, the question says that professors borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest. After 3 years, the university got Rs. 300 on interest.

Oh wait, rearranging it to solve for R, that would be R = I / (P * T). Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: R = 300 / (5000 * 3). Let me calculate the denominator first. 5000 multiplied by 3 is 15,000. So R is 300 divided by 15,000. Hmm, 300 divided by 15,000. Let's see, 300 \u00f7 15,000. \n\nWait, 15,000 divided by 300 is 50. So 300 divided by 15,000 is 1/50. Because 300 * 50 = 15,000. Oh, 1/50 is 0.02. So 0.02 is 2%.
