      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. \n\nThe question says: M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. D. If 3 men drop out, how much more will each have to contribute towards the purchase of the gift? The options are A to E, with E being none of these.\n\nHmm, okay. So initially, M men are buying a gift that costs D rupees. That means each man's share is the total cost divided by the number of men. So each would pay D divided by M. Right, so initial contribution per person is D/M.\n\nBut then, 3 men drop out. So the number of men becomes M minus 3. Now, the total cost D is still the same, but there are fewer people to split the cost. So each remaining man will have to pay more. I need to find how much more each has to pay compared to before.\n\nLet me think. After 3 drop out, the new number of men is (M - 3). So the new contribution per person is D divided by (M - 3). So the new amount per person is D/(M-3).\n\nThe question asks how much more each has to contribute. That means I subtract the original contribution from the new contribution. So the increase per person is [D/(M-3)] minus [D/M].\n\nLet me write that as an equation: \n\nIncrease = (D/(M-3)) - (D/M)\n\nI can factor out D from both terms, so:\n\nIncrease = D [1/(M-3) - 1/M]\n\nTo subtract the fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (M-3) and M. The common denominator would be M*(M-3). So:\n\n1/(M-3) = M/(M(M-3))\n1/M = (M-3)/(M(M-3))\n\nSo subtracting them:\n\nM/(M(M-3)) - (M-3)/(M(M-3)) = [M - (M-3)] / [M(M-3)]\n\nSimplify numerator: M - M +3 = 3.\n\nSo the difference is 3/(M(M-3)).\n\nSo now, the increase is D multiplied by 3/(M(M-3)), which is 3D/(M(M-3)).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Oh, right, because I had D multiplied by [3/(M(M-3))], so that's 3D divided by (M*(M-3)).\n\nSo the increase per person is 3D/(M(M-3)). Hmm.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: D/(M-3) \u2192 that's the new contribution, not the increase.\nOption B: MD/3 \u2192 Not sure what that represents. Maybe if someone thought 3 men drop out, so 3 multiplied by something else? Not sure. Doesn't seem right.\nOption C: M/(D-3) \u2192 Doesn't make much sense. The units don't match. D is the total, and M is the number of men. So D-3 would be in rupees, M is a count, so that would be rupees per man, but the structure doesn't fit.\nOption D: 3D/(M\u00b2 - 3M) \u2192 Oh wait, M squared minus 3M is M(M-3), so this is the same as 3D/(M(M-3)), which matches what I calculated. So option D is correct.\n\nWait, but let me look again. The options are A to E. Option D is written as 3D/(M2-3M). Oh, right, M2 probably stands for M squared. So yes, same as M(M-3). So that's the correct formula for the increase.\n\nSo the answer should be option D.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. So initial contribution is D/M. After 3 drop, it's D/(M-3). The increase is D/(M-3) - D/M. Let me compute that again.\n\nCompute [D/(M-3)] - [D/M] = D [1/(M-3) - 1/M] \n\nWhich is D [ (M - (M-3)) / (M(M-3)) ) ] = D [ 3/(M(M-3)) ] = 3D/(M(M-3)).\n\nYes, that's correct. So the increase is 3D/(M(M-3)), which matches option D. So the correct answer is D.\n",

So the increase per person is (D/(M-3)) minus (D/M).\n\nLet me compute that. Let's write it down:\n\nIncrease = (D/(M-3)) - (D/M)\n\nFactor D out: D [1/(M-3) - 1/M]\n\nTo subtract the fractions, find a common denominator, which would be M(M-3).
