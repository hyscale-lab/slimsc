      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about Sam's hard drive with 250 files, all of which are infected by either a virus or a worm, or both. I need to find out how many files were not infected by a worm. Hmm, let's see.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The problem mentions that all files are infected by either a virus, a worm, or both. So, the total number of files is 250. No files are uninfected by both, right? So the union of virus and worm infections covers all 250 files.\n\nNext, it says the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both. So, let's assign some variables. Let me think\u2014maybe let\u2019s say that the number of files infected by both is B. Then the number of files only infected by the worm is 2.5B.\n\nWait, right. Because only worm is 2.5 times the both. So, that's one part. Now, what about the virus? The problem also says that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Oh, wait, 50% not infected by virus means 50% are infected by a virus. So, half of 250 is 125. So, 125 files are infected by a virus. But wait, that includes those infected by both virus and worm, right? Because if a file has both, it's still counted as being infected by the virus.\n\nSo, the total number of files with a virus is 125, which includes both only virus and both. Let me think: the virus total is only virus plus both. Let me denote V as the number of files with only a virus infection. So, V + B = 125.\n\nAnd the worm-only is 2.5B, as I thought earlier.\n\nNow, the total number of files is all the files. So, the sum of only virus, only worm, and both should be 250. Because all are infected by at least one.\n\nSo, that equation would be V + 2.5B + B = 250. Because V is only virus, 2.5B is only worm, and B is both. So, V + 3.5B =250.\n\nBut I also have V + B =125 from earlier. So, I can substitute V from that equation into the first.\n\nFrom V + B =125, V = 125 - B.\n\nSubstituting into the other equation: (125 - B) + 3.5B =250.\n\nSimplify that: 125 - B +3.5B =250 \u2192 125 + 2.5B =250.\n\nSubtract 125 from both sides: 2.5B = 125.\n\nDivide both sides by 2.5: B=125/2.5. Let me calculate that: 125 divided by 2.5 is 50. Because 2.5 times 50 is 125.\n\nSo, B is 50. That means 50 files are infected by both.\n\nNow, the only worm is 2.5B, which is 2.5 *50=125. So, 125 files have only the worm.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let's check the total. Only virus is V=125 - B=125-50=75. So, only virus is 75, only worm is 125, both is 50. Adding them up:75+125+50=250. Yep, that adds up correctly.\n\nBut the question is asking for the number of files not infected by a worm. So, which files are not infected by a worm? They are the files that are only virus, because if a file is not infected by a worm, it must be only virus or neither. But since all files are infected by at least one, it's only the ones with only virus.\n\nSo, the number of files not infected by a worm is V, which is 75.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, C is 75. So, the answer should be C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by defining variables and setting up equations based on the given information:\n\n1. Let \\( B \\) represent the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.\n2. The number of files infected only by a worm is \\( 2.5B \\).\n3. The total number of files is 250, and all files are infected by at least one of the two (virus or worm).

Let me read through the problem again.\n\nSo, all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So that means the total number of files is 250, and every single one is infected by at least one of the two. \n\nThe problem says the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both. Oh right, so let's denote some variables to make this clearer. \n\nLet me define:\n- Let V be the number of files infected by a virus.\n- Let W be the number of files infected by a worm.\n- Let B be the number of files infected by both virus and worm.\n- Let V_only be the number infected only by virus (so V_only = V - B).\n- Let W_only be the number infected only by worm (so W_only = W - B).\n\nFrom the problem, W_only is 2.5 times B. So W_only = 2.5 * B. That's one equation.\n\nAlso, the problem states that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, 50% of 250 is 125. So 125 files are not infected by a virus. That means these 125 files are only infected by a worm or neither. But wait, the problem says all files are infected by either virus or worm or both. So those 125 files are only infected by a worm. Because if they're not infected by a virus, but all files are infected, they must be only worm.\n\nSo W_only = 125. Because 125 files are not infected by virus, so they're only worm. Wait, no. Wait, if 50% are not infected by virus, that means 50% are infected by virus. So 50% of 250 is 125. So the number of files infected by virus (V) is 125? No, wait. Wait, 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. So the number of files NOT infected by virus is 125. So the number of files that are infected by virus is 250 - 125 = 125. Oh, right. Because all files are either infected by virus or worm or both. So V is 125.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If 50% were not infected by a virus, that means 50% are infected by a virus (since all are infected by either). So the number of files infected by virus is 125. So V = 125.\n\nWait, but V includes the files that are infected by both virus and worm. So V = V_only + B = 125.\n\nFrom earlier, W_only is 125, right? Because those 125 are only worm. So W_only = 125.\n\nBut wait, another part says W_only is 2.5 times B. So 125 = 2.5 * B. Let me compute that. 2.5 * B = 125. So B = 125 / 2.5. Hmm, 125 divided by 2.5 is 50. Because 2.5 * 50 = 125. So B is 50.\n\nSo now, V = V_only + B. We know V is 125, so V_only is 125 - B = 125 -50=75.\n\nSo, V_only is 75. So the number of files only virus is 75, only worm is 125, and both is 50. Let me check if the total adds up. 75 + 125 +50 = 250. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThe question asks: How many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Well, the files not infected by a worm would be those only infected by virus, which is V_only. Because worm only and both are infected by worm, so the ones not infected by worm are only virus.\n\nSo V_only is 75. So the answer should be 75.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 75. So the answer is C.\n\nLet me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recap:\n\n- Total files: 250.\n- 50% not infected by virus \u2192 125 files.
