      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Peter wants to form a scavenger hunt team, and he needs 10 additional people. Hmm, wait, but he's the one starting it, so maybe he's including himself in the team? Oh, wait, the question says he wants to find 10 more, so the total team size would be 11, including himself. But I'm not sure if that's relevant yet.\n\nHe has 10 friends who would like to participate. So he's looking to choose 10 people from his 10 friends. Wait, that makes sense. He needs 10 more, and he has exactly 10 friends available. So he's trying to choose all 10 of them to join the team.\n\nSo the question is asking how many choices he has for forming his team. Since he needs exactly 10 people and he has exactly 10 friends, how many ways can he choose them? Well, he can't choose any more or any fewer. So he has to choose all 10 friends.\n\nIn combinatorics, the number of ways to choose all items from a set is 1. Because there's only one way to include everyone. For example, if you have 3 apples and you choose all 3, there's only one combination possible.\n\nSo the number of choices here is 1. Looking at the options, B is 1. So the correct answer should be B.\n",

Oh, right, because he's the one organizing it, so the team would consist of himself plus 10 others. Or wait, maybe not. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says, \"Peter wants to find 10 additional people to form a scavenger hunt team with him.\" So the team size is Peter plus 10, making it 11 people in total. But wait, the question is about how many choices he has for forming his team. Oh, wait, the friends he has are 10, and he wants to choose 10 additional people. So he has exactly 10 friends available, and he needs 10 more. So that would mean he has only one choice, which is to take all of his friends.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. If he has 10 friends and he needs to choose 10, how many ways can he do that? Because the number of choices is about combinations. The number of ways to choose 10 people out of 10 is 1.
