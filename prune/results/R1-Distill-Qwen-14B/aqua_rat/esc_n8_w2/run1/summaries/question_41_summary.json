      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Jack buying sharpeners. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says Jack buys 18 sharpeners, which are white and brown. He spends a total of 100 rupees. Also, he pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than each brown one. I need to find out how many white and brown sharpeners he bought.\n\nLet me break this down. I think I should set up some variables first. Let's say the number of white sharpeners is W and the number of brown ones is B. So, the total number of sharpeners is W + B = 18. That's our first equation.\n\nNow, about the cost. He pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than each brown one. Let me think, if the cost per brown sharpener is, say, x rupees, then each white one would cost x + 1 rupees. So, the total cost would be the number of white ones multiplied by (x+1) plus the number of brown ones multiplied by x.\n\nSo the total cost equation would be: W*(x+1) + B*x = 100.\n\nBut wait, I have two variables here: W and B, and also x. Hmm, but I have another equation from the total number of sharpeners. So maybe I can substitute that.\n\nSince W + B = 18, I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let's say B = 18 - W. So substituting B into the cost equation.\n\nSo, the cost equation becomes: W*(x+1) + (18 - W)*x = 100.\n\nLet me expand this. Wx + W + 18x - Wx = 100. Wait, the Wx and -Wx will cancel each other out. So, that leaves me with W + 18x = 100.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So now I have W + 18x = 100, and I know that W + B = 18, which is B = 18 - W.\n\nBut I have two variables here: W and x. I need another equation to solve for both. Wait, maybe I can express x in terms of W or something else.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find integer values since the number of sharpeners and the cost per unit must be whole numbers. Let me think about possible integer solutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can rearrange the equation. From W + 18x = 100, I can express x as (100 - W)/18.\n\nSince x must be an integer (because you can't pay a fraction of a rupee for each sharpener), 100 - W must be divisible by 18. Let's see which of the options satisfy this.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 10 white, 8 brown. So W=10. Then x = (100 -10)/18 =90/18=5. So x=5. That's an integer. So for each brown sharpener, it's 5 rupees, white is 6. Let's check the total cost: 10*6 +8*5 =60 +40=100. Yep, that works.\n\nOption B: W=9. x=(100-9)/18=91/18\u22485.055\u2026 Not an integer. So this option is probably not correct.\n\nOption C: W=7. x=(100-7)/18=93/18=5.166\u2026 Not integer. So no.\n\nOption D: W=5. x=(100-5)/18=95/18\u22485.277\u2026 Not integer.\n\nOption E: W=11. x=(100-11)/18=89/18\u22484.944\u2026 Not integer.\n\nSo the only option where x is integer is option A. Therefore, Jack bought 10 white and 8 brown sharpeners.\n\nWait, but let me double-check with the other options just in case. Because sometimes there might be another way.\n\nLet me check option E again: W=11. So x=89/18. That's about 4.944, which is not an integer. So no.\n\nSo the correct answer must be option A: 10 white and 8 brown.\n",

The tricky part is that he pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than he does for each brown one.

Let's say the number of white sharpeners is W and the number of brown ones is B. So, since he buys a total of 18 sharpeners, I can write the first equation as:\n\nW + B = 18.\n\nThat's straightforward. Now, the second part is about the cost. He pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than each brown one. So, let's let the cost of a brown sharpener be x rupees. Then, the cost of a white sharpener would be x + 1 rupees.\n\nSo, the total cost for the white sharpeners would be W*(x + 1), and for the brown ones, it's B*x. The sum of these is 100 rupees. So the second equation is:\n\nW*(x + 1) + B*x = 100.\n\nBut wait, I have two equations and three variables now: W, B, x. Hmm, that's not good because usually, I need as many equations as variables. Maybe I can express everything in terms of W or B to reduce the variables.\n\nFrom the first equation, I can express B as 18 - W. So, substitute B into the second equation.\n\nSo, substituting B = 18 - W into the second equation gives:\n\nW*(x + 1) + (18 - W)*x = 100.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nWx + W + 18x - Wx = 100.\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute each term. So, W*(x+1) is Wx + W, and (18-W)*x is 18x - Wx. Adding them together:\n\n(Wx + W) + (18x - Wx) = 100.\n\nHmm, let me simplify this. The Wx and -Wx terms cancel each other. So what's left is:\n\nW + 18x = 100.\n\nSo, W + 18x = 100. Now, I have this equation, but I'm still stuck because I have two variables, W and x. Hmm, maybe I can express W in terms of x or vice versa.\n\nWait, let me think. W is the number of white sharpeners, so it has to be an integer between 0 and 18. Similarly, B is also an integer, same range. So perhaps I can find possible integer values for x that satisfy the equation W + 18x = 100, and also make W an integer.\n\nWait, but W is 18 - B, which is also an integer. So, maybe I can find x such that 18x is close to 100, and W is 100 - 18x, which must be a positive integer less than or equal to 18.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. Let me solve for W:\n\nW = 100 - 18x.\n\nBut since W must be a positive integer less than or equal to 18, 100 - 18x must be between 1 and 18, inclusive.\n\nSo, 1 \u2264 100 - 18x \u2264 18.\n\nLet me solve for x. Let's split this into two inequalities.\n\nFirst, 100 - 18x \u2265 1:\n100 -1 \u2265 18x \u2192 99 \u2265 18x \u2192 x \u2264 99/18 \u2192 x \u2264 5.5.\n\nSecond, 100 -18x \u226418:\n100 -18 \u226418x \u2192 82 \u226418x \u2192 x \u226582/18 \u2192 x \u22654.555... approximately.\n\nSo x must be between approximately 4.555 and 5.5.\n\nBut x is the cost of a brown sharpener. Since we can't have a fraction of a rupee in this context (assuming x is an integer), x must be 5, because 4.555 is just above 4.5, so the next integer is 5.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check: if x=5, then W=100 -18*5 = 100-90=10. So W=10. Then B=18-10=8. So that's 10 white and 8 brown sharpeners.\n\nWait, let me check if that fits into the total cost. So each white is 5+1=6 rupees, brown is 5. So 10 *6=60, 8*5=40. 60+40=100. Yep, that works.\n\nBut wait, what if x=4? Let's see. Then W=100-18*4=100-72=28. But 28 is more than 18, which isn't possible because total is 18. So x can't be 4.\n\nWhat about x=6? Let's see. Then W=100-18*6=100-108= -8. Negative, which doesn't make sense. So x=6 is too high.\n\nSo x must be 5, leading to W=10, B=8. So the answer would be 10 white and 8 brown. Looking at the options, option A is 10,8.\n\nWait, but let me check the other options just to be thorough. Let's see the options are:\n\nA)10,8\nB)9,8\nC)7,8\nD)5,6\nE)11,12.\n\nWait, option E is 11,12, but 11+12=23, which is more than 18. So E is out.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake earlier? Because in the equation, I have W + B =18. So in option E, 11+12=23, which is impossible. So E is wrong.\n\nNow, let's see the other options. Option A:10 and 8, which sums to 18. So that's correct.\n\nBut what about the cost? Let me recheck. If x is 5, brown is 5, white is 6. So 10*6=60, 8*5=40. 60+40=100. Correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another possible x. For example, if x is 4.555, but that's not an integer. So the only possible integer x is 5.\n\nSo the answer should be A)10,8.\n\nWait, but the options have B as 9,8. Let me see what happens if x is not 5. Suppose x is 4. Let's compute W=100-18*4=28, which is impossible because W can't be more than 18. So x=5 is the only possibility.\n\nSo the correct answer is A)10,8.\n",

Let's split this into two inequalities.\n\nFirst, 100 - 18x \u2265 1:\n100 -1 \u2265 18x \u2192 99 \u2265 18x \u2192 x \u2264 99/18 \u2192 x \u2264 5.5.\n\nSecond, 100 -18x \u226418:\n100 -18 \u226418x \u2192 82 \u226418x \u2192 x \u226582/18 \u2192 x \u22654.555... approximately.\n\nSo x must be between approximately 4.555 and 5.5.\n\nBut x is the cost of a brown sharpener. Since we can't have a fraction of a rupee in this context (assuming x is an integer), x must be 5, because 4.555 is just above 4.5, so the next integer is 5.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check: if x=5, then W=100 -18*5 = 100-90=10. So W=10. Then B=18-10=8. So that's 10 white and 8 brown sharpeners.\n\nWait, let me check if that fits into the total cost. So each white is 5+1=6 rupees, brown is 5. So 10 *6=60, 8*5=40. 60+40=100. Yep, that works.\n\nBut wait, what if x=4? Let's see. Then W=100-18*4=100-72=28. But 28 is more than 18, which isn't possible because total is 18. So x can't be 4.\n\nWhat about x=6? Let's see. Then W=100-18*6=100-108= -8. Negative, which doesn't make sense. So x=6 is too high.\n\nSo x must be 5, leading to W=10, B=8. So the answer would be 10 white and 8 brown. Looking at the options, option A is 10,8.\n\nWait, but let me check the other options just to be thorough. Let's see the options are:\n\nA)10,8\nB)9,8\nC)7,8\nD)5,6\nE)11,12.\n\nWait, option E is 11,12, but 11+12=23, which is more than 18. So E is out.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake earlier? Because in the equation, I have W + B =18. So in option E, 11+12=23, which is impossible. So E is wrong.\n\nNow, let's see the other options. Option A:10 and 8, which sums to 18. So that's correct.\n\nBut what about the cost? Let me recheck. If x is 5, brown is 5, white is 6. So 10*6=60, 8*5=40. 60+40=100. Correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another possible x. For example, if x is 4.555, but that's not an integer. So the only possible integer x is 5.\n\nSo the answer should be A)10,8.\n\nWait, but the options have B as 9,8. Let me see what happens if x is not 5. Suppose x is 4. Let's compute W=100-18*4=28, which is impossible because W can't be more than 18. So x=5 is the only possibility.\n\nSo the correct answer is A)10,8.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Let \\( W \\) be the number of white sharpeners and \\( B \\) be the number of brown sharpeners.  \n   Since Jack buys a total of 18 sharpeners, we have:  \n   \\[\n   W + B = 18\n   \\]\n\n2. Let the cost of each brown sharpener be \\( x \\) rupees. Then, the cost of each white sharpener is \\( x + 1 \\) rupees (since he pays 1 rupee more for white sharpeners). The total cost is 100 rupees, so:  \n   \\[\n   W(x + 1) + Bx = 100\n   \\]\n\n3. Substitute \\( B = 18 - W \\) from the first equation into the second equation:  \n   \\[\n   W(x + 1) + (18 - W)x = 100\n   \\]\n   Expanding and simplifying:  \n   \\[\n   Wx + W + 18x - Wx = 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   W + 18x = 100\n   \\]\n\n4. Solve for \\( W \\):  \n   \\[\n   W = 100 - 18x\n   \\]\n   Since \\( W \\) must be a positive integer between 1 and 18, \\( 100 - 18x \\) must also fall within this range. This implies:  \n   \\[\n   1 \\leq 100 - 18x \\leq 18\n   \\]\n\n5. Solve the inequalities:  \n   - From \\( 100 - 18x \\geq 1 \\):  \n     \\[\n     99 \\geq 18x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x \\leq \\frac{99}{18} \\approx 5.5\n     \\]\n   - From \\( 100 - 18x \\leq 18 \\):  \n     \\[\n     82 \\leq 18x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x \\geq \\frac{82}{18} \\approx 4.56\n     \\]\n\n   Since \\( x \\) must be an integer, the only possible value is \\( x = 5 \\).\n\n6. Substitute \\( x = 5 \\) into \\( W = 100 - 18x \\):  \n   \\[\n   W = 100 - 18(5) = 100 - 90 = 10\n   \\]\n   Then, \\( B = 18 - W = 18 - 10 = 8 \\).\n\n7. Verify the total cost:  \n   - Cost of white sharpeners: \\( 10 \\times (5 + 1) = 10 \\times 6 = 60 \\) rupees  \n   - Cost of brown sharpeners: \\( 8 \\times 5 = 40 \\) rupees  \n   - Total cost: \\( 60 + 40 = 100 \\) rupees  \n\n   The calculations are consistent with the problem statement.\n\n8. Check the options:  \n   - Option A: \\( 10, 8 \\) is correct.  \n   - Other options either do not sum to 18 or fail the cost verification.\n\nThus, Jack bought **10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners**.\n\nAnswer: A",
