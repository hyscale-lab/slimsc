      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem says an organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh by getting equal contributions from each employee. Then, it says that if each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. The question is asking how many employees are in the organization. The options are A)300, B)200, C)400, D)100, E)500.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's break this down. I think I should use algebra to solve for the number of employees. Let me define some variables.\n\nLet's let the number of employees be 'n'. So each employee contributes some amount, say 'x' rupees. So the total contribution is n multiplied by x, which equals 6 lakh. So, the first equation is:\n\nn * x = 6,00,000.\n\nThen, the problem states that if each employee contributed Rs. 60 more, the total would be 6.24 lakh. So in that case, each employee's contribution becomes (x + 60), and the total is n*(x+60) = 6,24,000.\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1. n*x = 6,00,000\n2. n*(x + 60) = 6,24,000\n\nI can solve these equations to find 'n'. Let's see.\n\nFrom the first equation, x = 6,00,000 / n.\n\nSubstituting x into the second equation:\n\nn*( (6,00,000 / n) + 60 ) = 6,24,000.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's simplify the left side:\n\nn*(6,00,000/n + 60) = 6,24,000.\n\nThe n in the denominator and the n in the numerator cancel out for the first term. So it becomes:\n\n6,00,000 + 60n = 6,24,000.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Now, subtract 6,00,000 from both sides:\n\n60n = 6,24,000 - 6,00,000.\n\nWhich is 60n = 24,000.\n\nSo, n = 24,000 / 60.\n\nLet me compute that. 24,000 divided by 60. Well, 60 times 400 is 24,000. Because 60*400 is 24,000. So n=400.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, 60n = 24,000. Dividing both sides by 60:\n\nn = 24,000 / 60 = 400. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the number of employees is 400. Looking back at the options, option C is 400. So the answer should be C.\n\nJust to double-check, let's plug the numbers back in. If there are 400 employees, the initial contribution per person is 6,00,000 / 400 = 1,500. So each contributes 1,500. If they contribute 60 more, that's 1,560 each. Multiply by 400: 400 * 1,560 = 624,000, which is 6.24 lakh. Yep, that matches the problem statement.\n",

Then, it says if each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. I need to find out how many employees there are.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. I think I'll start by assigning variables to make things clearer. Let me denote the number of employees as N. And each employee's contribution is equal, so let's say each contributes X rupees.\n\nSo, the total contribution is N multiplied by X, which equals 6 lakh. So, the equation would be:\n\nN * X = 6,00,000\n\nThat's the first part. Now, the second scenario is that each employee contributes Rs.60 more, so each contributes (X + 60). And the total in this case is 6.24 lakh. So the second equation is:\n\nN * (X + 60) = 6,24,000\n\nWait, I think I should write this in terms of numbers without the commas for clarity. So, 6,00,000 is 600,000 and 6,24,000 is 624,000.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. N * X = 600,000\n2. N * (X + 60) = 624,000\n\nI can solve these equations simultaneously to find N. Let me subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate some variables.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\nN*(X + 60) - N*X = 624,000 - 600,000\n\nSimplify the left side: N*X + 60N - N*X = 60N\n\nRight side: 24,000\n\nSo 60N = 24,000\n\nNow, solving for N: N = 24,000 / 60\n\nLet me calculate that. 24,000 divided by 60. Hmm, 60 times 400 is 24,000. So N is 400.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me plug this back into the first equation to find X.\n\nN is 400, so 400 * X = 600,000. So X = 600,000 / 400.\n\n600,000 divided by 400. Let's see, 400 * 1500 is 600,000. So X is 1500.\n\nNow, if each contributes 60 more, that's 1560 each. So 400 employees contributing 1560 each would be 400 * 1560. Let me calculate that.\n\n400 * 1500 is 600,000. 400 * 60 is 24,000. So total is 624,000, which matches the second scenario. So it all checks out.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 400. So that's the answer.\n",
