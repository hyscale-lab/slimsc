      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about bus and train fares. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that the bus fare for two persons traveling between Agra and Aligarh is four-thirds the train fare for one person. Wait, that sounds a bit tricky. Let me write that down to make it clearer.\n\nSo, if I let the train fare for one person be, say, T rupees. Then the bus fare for two persons would be (4/3)*T. That makes sense because it's four-thirds of the train fare. So, the bus fare per two people is (4/3)T.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the fare for each person by bus. Because the problem later talks about 6 persons traveling by bus. So, if two people pay (4/3)T together, then one person's bus fare would be half of that. Let me calculate that.\n\nSo, for one person by bus, it's (4/3)T divided by 2. That would be (4/3)T * (1/2) = (2/3)T. Oh, okay, so the bus fare per person is (2/3)T.\n\nNow, the problem states that 6 persons are traveling by bus and 8 by train. The total amount they paid together is Rs.1512. I need to set up an equation for this.\n\nLet me denote the train fare as T. Then, the total fare for the bus travelers would be 6 persons multiplied by the per-person bus fare. So that's 6 * (2/3)T. And the train travelers would pay 8 * T. Adding these together gives the total of 1512.\n\nSo the equation is:\n6*(2/3)T + 8*T = 1512.\n\nLet me compute each part. First, 6*(2/3)T. Let's see, 6 multiplied by 2 is 12, divided by 3 is 4. So 6*(2/3)T equals 4T.\n\nThen, 8*T is just 8T.\n\nSo adding those together: 4T + 8T = 12T. And this equals 1512.\n\nSo, 12T = 1512. To find T, I divide both sides by 12. Let me do that: 1512 \u00f7 12.\n\nHmm, what's 12 times 126? Let's see, 12*100 is 1200, 12*26 is 312, so 1200+312=1512. So T is 126.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 126. So that must be the answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake in fractions.\n\nSo the bus fare for two is (4/3)T. So per person, it's (4/3)T divided by 2, which is indeed (2/3)T. Then, 6 people by bus: 6*(2/3)T. 6*(2/3) is 4, so 4T. 8 people by train: 8T. 4T +8T is 12T. 12T=1512 \u2192 T=126. Yep, that seems correct. So the train fare per person is Rs.126.\n",

Hmm, let's read it carefully.\n\nThe question says the bus fare for two persons traveling between Agra and Aligarh is four-thirds the train fare for one person. Oh wait, that's a bit tricky. Let me break it down. So if the train fare for one person is, say, T rupees, then the bus fare for two people is (4/3) * T. That makes sense because it's four-thirds the train fare.\n\nThen, the total fare paid by 6 persons taking the bus and 8 persons taking the train is Rs.1512. I need to find the train fare for one person, which is T.\n\nLet me set up the equations. The bus fare for two people is (4/3)T, so for one person on the bus, it would be (4/3)T divided by 2, right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the bus fare for two persons is (4/3)T. So if I have 6 persons on the bus, how many bus fares do I have? Well, each bus fare covers two people, so 6 divided by 2 is 3. So the total bus fare is 3 times (4/3)T. Let me compute that: 3 * (4/3)T = 4T.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. If two people pay (4/3)T together, then for each pair, it's (4/3)T. So 6 people would be 3 such pairs. So 3*(4/3)T = 4T. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nAnd for the train, 8 persons. Each person pays T, so 8*T = 8T.\n\nThe total is 4T (bus) + 8T (train) = 12T. But wait, the total is 1512. So 12T = 1512. So T would be 1512 / 12. Let me calculate that. 1512 divided by 12. Hmm, 12 times 126 is 1512 because 12*120=1440, and 12*6=72, so 1440+72=1512. So T is 126. Wait, but looking at the options, A is 126. So that's the answer.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check my initial setup. Because sometimes I might mix up the per person and per two persons part.\n\nThe bus fare for two persons is (4/3)T. So for 6 persons, how many two-person sets are there? 6 / 2 = 3. So 3*(4/3)T = 4T. That part is correct. And 8 persons by train is 8T. So 4T +8T = 12T =1512. So T=1512/12=126. So the train fare is 126, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, A is 126, but let me check if I made any mistake in the initial setup. Did I confuse the bus fare for one person with two? Let me think again.\n\nThe bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one. So, Bus Fare (for 2) = (4/3) * Train Fare (for 1). So, for 6 persons by bus, the fare is (6/2) * Bus Fare per 2 persons. Which is 3 * (4/3 T) =4T. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Let me denote the train fare as T. Then, the bus fare for two is (4/3)T. So per person bus fare is (4/3 T)/2 = 2/3 T.\n\nWait, that's another way to look at it. So if each person on the bus pays 2/3 T, then for 6 people, it's 6*(2/3 T) =4T. Same as before. So yes, 4T +8T=12T=1512, so T=126. So the answer is A)126.\n",
