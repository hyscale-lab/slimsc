      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about making identical bouquets with white and red tulips. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. \n\nThe question is, what's the greatest number of identical bouquets I can make using 28 white and 98 red tulips, without leaving any flowers out. And the bouquets are identical if they have the same number of each color. So each bouquet has the same count of white and red tulips.\n\nHmm, so I think I need to find how many bouquets I can make where each bouquet has a certain number of white and red tulips, and all the bouquets are the same. Also, all the flowers must be used, so none are left over.\n\nLet me think about this. So, the problem is essentially about dividing both the white and red tulips into equal groups, and the number of such groups will be the number of bouquets. Each group (bouquet) will have a certain number of white and red tulips.\n\nWait, this sounds like finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers, 28 and 98. Because the GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. So if I can find the GCD of 28 and 98, that should give me the maximum number of identical bouquets.\n\nLet me calculate the GCD of 28 and 98. \n\nFirst, list the factors of each number. \n\nFactors of 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.\n\nFactors of 98: 1, 2, 7, 14, 49, 98.\n\nNow, the common factors are 1, 2, 7, 14. The largest of these is 14. So the GCD is 14. \n\nWait, but does that make sense? If the GCD is 14, then each bouquet would have 28/14 = 2 white tulips and 98/14 = 7 red tulips. So each bouquet has 2 white and 7 red, and there would be 14 bouquets. That uses all the flowers because 14*2=28 white and 14*7=98 red. \n\nBut wait, let me check the options. The options are A)4, B)7, C)10, D)14, E)21. So 14 is an option, option D. \n\nBut wait, could there be a higher number than 14? Like, for example, 21? Because 21 is option E. But 21 doesn't divide 28. 28 divided by 21 is more than 1 but leaves a remainder. So no, 21 isn't a divisor of 28. So 14 is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe I should think in terms of the number of bouquets possible. Let's say I make 'n' bouquets. Each bouquet will have w white tulips and r red tulips. Then, the total white used is n*w =28, and the total red is n*r=98. So both 28 and 98 must be divisible by n. So n must be a common divisor of 28 and 98. The maximum n is the GCD, which is 14.\n\nSo yeah, the answer should be D)14.\n",

The question is asking for the greatest number of identical bouquets I can make without leaving any flowers unused. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, I've got 28 white tulips and 98 red ones. Each bouquet must use some number of white and red tulips, and all bouquets need to be identical. That means each bouquet will have the same count of white and red tulips. And I can't leave any flowers, so all of them must be used up.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding how many bouquets I can make such that when I multiply the number of bouquets by the number of white tulips per bouquet, I get exactly 28. Similarly, for the red ones, multiplying the number by the red per bouquet should give 98. And I need the maximum number of bouquets possible.\n\nWait, right, this sounds like a problem involving factors and greatest common divisors. Because the number of bouquets has to divide both 28 and 98 evenly. So, the number of bouquets, let's call it 'b', must be a common divisor of 28 and 98. And we need the greatest such number.\n\nSo, I should find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98. Once I have that, that's the maximum number of bouquets I can make.\n\nLet me calculate the GCD of 28 and 98. I remember the Euclidean algorithm for this. Let's see, 98 divided by 28 is 3 with a remainder of 14 (because 28*3=84, 98-84=14). Then, take 28 divided by 14, which is 2 with no remainder. So the GCD is 14.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. 28 is 2^2 * 7, and 98 is 2 * 7^2. So the common prime factors are 2 and 7. The minimum exponents are 1 for 2 and 1 for 7, so 2*7=14. Yep, so the GCD is 14.\n\nSo, the greatest number of identical bouquets would be 14. Each bouquet would have 28/14 = 2 white tulips, and 98/14 = 7 red tulips. So each bouquet is 2 white and 7 red.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, D is 14. So that should be the answer. But let me make sure I'm not making any mistake.\n\nWait, is there a possibility that the GCD isn't the right approach? Because the problem is about the maximum number of bouquets such that both 28 and 98 are exactly divided by the number of bouquets. So yes, the GCD is the right approach because it's the largest number that divides both quantities without remainder.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of the number of bouquets being a common factor. So, the number of bouquets can't be higher than the GCD, because otherwise, you can't split both 28 and 98 into equal parts. So 14 is the maximum.\n\nLooking at the options again, E is 21, which is higher than 14. But 21 doesn't divide 28? Wait, 28 divided by 21 is about 1.333, which isn't an integer. So 21 can't be a divisor of 28. So E is out.\n\nSo the correct answer is D)14.\n",
