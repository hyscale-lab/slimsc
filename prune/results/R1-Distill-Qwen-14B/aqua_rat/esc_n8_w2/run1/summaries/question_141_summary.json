      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe store has only yellow and white golf balls. At the start of the day, they had 600 golf balls. By the end, they sold 80% of their inventory. So, they sold 80% of 600, right? Let me calculate that first. \n\n80% of 600 is 0.8 * 600 = 480. So, they sold 480 golf balls that day. That means they have 600 - 480 = 120 left, but wait, maybe I don't need that right now.\n\nThe problem says they sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. Hmm, so the number of yellow sold equals the number of white sold. Also, in selling those, they sold all of their white golf balls. Oh, that's important. So, they sold all the white ones, but only some of the yellow ones.\n\nLet me try to break it down. Let's say the store had Y yellow balls and W white balls at the beginning. So, Y + W = 600.\n\nThey sold 480 balls in total, and that's 80% of the initial stock. And the number of yellow sold equals the number of white sold. So, if they sold all white balls, that means W is equal to the number of white balls sold. Since the number of white and yellow sold are equal, the yellow sold is also W. \n\nSo, total sold is W (white) + W (yellow) = 2W. But wait, the total sold was 480. So 2W = 480. Solving for W gives W = 240. So, the store had 240 white balls at the beginning.\n\nSince the total initial was 600, Y + W = 600. W is 240, so Y = 600 - 240 = 360. So, the store had 360 yellow balls at the start. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. If there were 360 yellows and 240 whites, that's 600. They sold 240 white balls (all of them) and 240 yellow balls. So, total sold is 240 + 240 = 480, which is correct. After selling, yellows left are 360 - 240 = 120. Whites left are zero, which makes sense because they sold all the white balls.\n\nSo the answer should be 360, which is option E. Let me check the options. Option E is 360, so that's the correct answer.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a sporting goods store that only sells yellow and white golf balls. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nAlright, the store starts the day with 600 golf balls in total. By the end of the day, they've sold 80% of their inventory. Hmm, so first I should figure out how many they sold. Let me calculate that: 80% of 600 is... 0.8 * 600 equals 480. So they sold 480 golf balls.\n\nWait, but the problem says that they sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. Oh, right, and also, by selling those, they sold all of their white golf balls. So that means the number of white golf balls they had initially must be equal to the number of white balls they sold, which is half of the total sold, since yellow and white sold are equal. Wait, wait, wait. No, because they sold all of their white balls, but maybe not all of their yellow ones.\n\nLet me clarify. The total sold is 480, which is split equally between yellow and white. So the number of white balls sold is 480 divided by 2, which is 240. So they sold 240 white balls. And since they sold all of their white balls, that means the store had exactly 240 white balls at the beginning.\n\nNow, the total initial stock is 600. If 240 of those are white, the rest must be yellow. So subtracting 240 from 600 gives me 360. So the store had 360 yellow balls at the start.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So they sold 240 white balls and 240 yellow balls, right? So total sold is 480, which checks out. The initial white was 240, so after selling all, none left. The initial yellow was 360, so after selling 240, they have 120 left. But the question is about how many yellows they had to begin with, which is 360.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 360. So that should be the answer.\n",
