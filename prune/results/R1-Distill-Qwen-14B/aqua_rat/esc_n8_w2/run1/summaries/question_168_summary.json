      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two ants moving towards each other. Let's see, I need to find the distance that ant A travels before they meet. Hmm. Alright, let me break this down.\n\nSo, the ants are starting from their respective farms which are 75 cm apart. Ant A's speed is 9 cm per hour, and ant B is moving at 6 cm per hour. I think I remember that when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So, adding 9 and 6 would give me 15 cm per hour. That makes sense because they're moving towards each other, so their speeds add up.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how long it takes for them to meet. Since they're starting 75 cm apart, the time taken until they meet should be the total distance divided by their combined speed. So that's 75 cm divided by 15 cm per hour. Let me calculate that: 75 /15 is 5. So it takes them 5 hours to meet. Wait, 15 times 5 is 75, yes that's correct.\n\nNow, the question is asking how far ant A travels until they meet. Since ant A is moving at 9 cm per hour for 5 hours, I can find the distance by multiplying speed and time. So 9 cm/hour * 5 hours equals 45 cm. Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 45. That seems right.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check. So, in 5 hours, ant A goes 9 *5 =45, ant B goes 6*5=30. Together, 45+30=75, which is the initial distance. That adds up correctly. So yes, 45 cm is the correct distance for ant A. So the answer should be option A.\n",

I think I remember that when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.
