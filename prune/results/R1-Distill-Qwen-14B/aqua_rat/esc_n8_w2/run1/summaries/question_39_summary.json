      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a shop assistant's salary. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. \n\nThe question says that the monthly salary S is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. We need to find out what the monthly sales should be so that her salary reaches $1500. \n\nHmm, right. So her total salary is made up of two parts: a fixed part which is $500 every month, and a variable part which is 5% of her sales. So if she sells a lot, her salary goes up. \n\nWe need to find the sales amount, let's call it S, that makes her total salary $1500. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait, no, the problem says the salary is S, and it's equal to 500 plus 5% of sales. Oh, but wait, the question is asking about the sales needed to make her salary $1500. So maybe I should let the sales be another variable. Let me think.\n\nLet me define variables to make it clear. Let me say that her fixed salary is $500. Then, she earns 5% of her monthly sales as a commission. So her total salary S_total would be 500 + 0.05 * sales. \n\nBut wait, the problem says the monthly salary S is 500 plus 5% of sales. So S = 500 + 0.05 * sales. And we want S to be $1500. So we set S equal to 1500 and solve for sales.\n\nSo let's write that equation:\n\n1500 = 500 + 0.05 * sales.\n\nWait, that's the equation I need to solve. So let me subtract 500 from both sides to isolate the commission part. \n\n1500 - 500 = 0.05 * sales.\n\nWhich simplifies to 1000 = 0.05 * sales.\n\nThen, I need to solve for sales. So I can divide both sides by 0.05. \n\nSales = 1000 / 0.05.\n\nHmm, what's 1000 divided by 0.05? Let me think. 0.05 is the same as 5 cents, right? So 1000 divided by 0.05 is the same as 1000 multiplied by 20, because 1/0.05 is 20. So 1000 * 20 = 20,000.\n\nWait, so sales should be $20,000. Let me check that. If she sells $20,000, then 5% of that is $1000. So her total salary is 500 + 1000 = 1500. Yep, that matches the target.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is $20,000. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations just to be sure. So 5% of 20,000 is (5/100)*20000 = 1000. Add 500, get 1500. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the monthly sales required for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500, we start with the given formula for her salary:\n\n\\[\nS = 500 + 0.05 \\times \\text{sales}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( S \\) is the total salary, and \"sales\" is the monthly sales amount. We are given that \\( S = 1500 \\), so we substitute this into the equation:\n\n\\[\n1500 = 500 + 0.05 \\times \\text{sales}\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 500 from both sides to isolate the commission part:\n\n\\[\n1000 = 0.05 \\times \\text{sales}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \"sales,\" divide both sides by 0.05:\n\n\\[\n\\text{sales} = \\frac{1000}{0.05} = 20000\n\\]\n\nThus, the monthly sales must be $20,000. Verifying, 5% of $20,000 is $1000, and adding the fixed salary of $500 gives a total salary of $1500, which matches the target. \n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: D**",

Let's let S be the salary and let's say the sales are X dollars. So the formula would be S = 500 + 0.05 * X.\n\nWe're given that S should be $1500. So substituting that in, it's 1500 = 500 + 0.05X. Now I need to solve for X.\n\nLet me subtract 500 from both sides to get the 0.05X by itself. So 1500 minus 500 is 1000. So 1000 = 0.05X. \n\nNow, to find X, I need to divide both sides by 0.05. Hmm, 1000 divided by 0.05. Let me think about that. 0.05 is the same as 5/100, so dividing by 5/100 is the same as multiplying by 100/5, which is 20. So 1000 times 20 is 20,000. So X is 20,000.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my math. 0.05 times 20,000 is 1000, right? Because 20,000 times 0.05 is the same as 20,000 * 5% which is 1000. Then adding the fixed 500, 500 + 1000 is 1500. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nSo the required sales should be $20,000. Looking at the options, option D is $20,000. So the answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Sometimes I might mix up the percentage. Oh wait, no, the equation is correct. Because 5% is 0.05, and that's multiplied by sales. So yeah, the calculation seems right.\n",
