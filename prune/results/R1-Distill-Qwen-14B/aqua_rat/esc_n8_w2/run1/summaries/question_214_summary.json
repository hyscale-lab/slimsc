      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a boy trying to climb a staircase with 10 steps. The question is asking how many different ways he can reach the top if he can take either one or two steps each time. Hmm, I've heard about these kinds of problems before; I think they have something to do with the Fibonacci sequence or something like that.\n\nWait, right. So each step, the boy has two choices: take one step or two steps. So for each step he's on, he can come from either one step before (if he took a single step) or two steps before (if he took a double step). That sounds recursive. So the number of ways to get to step n is the sum of the ways to get to step n-1 and step n-2.\n\nLet me think about the base cases. For n=1, there's only one way: take a single step. For n=2, he can either take two single steps or one double step, so that's two ways. So for n=1, it's 1 way; n=2, 2 ways.\n\nThen for n=3: he can come from n=2 by taking a single step, or from n=1 by taking a double. So the ways would be the sum of the ways for n=2 and n=1. So 2 + 1 = 3 ways.\n\nWait, let's list them to make sure. For 3 steps:\n1. 1+1+1\n2. 1+2\n3. 2+1\nYes, that's 3 ways. So the pattern is each term is the sum of the two previous terms.\n\nSo this is the Fibonacci sequence, but shifted a bit. Because Fibonacci starts with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc. But here, for n=1, it's 1, n=2 is 2, n=3 is 3, n=4 would be 5, right?\n\nSo maybe the number of ways for n steps is the (n+1)th Fibonacci number. Let me see. Let's map it out:\n\nn | ways | Fibonacci number (F(n+1))\n1 | 1    | F(2) = 1\n2 | 2    | F(3) = 2\n3 | 3    | F(4) = 3\n4 | 5    | F(5) =5\nYes, that seems to fit. So for n=10, the number of ways should be F(11).\n\nWait, what's the Fibonacci sequence? Let me write it out:\n\nF(1)=1\nF(2)=1\nF(3)=2\nF(4)=3\nF(5)=5\nF(6)=8\nF(7)=13\nF(8)=21\nF(9)=34\nF(10)=55\nF(11)=89\nF(12)=144\n\nSo for n=10 steps, the number of ways is F(11) which is 89. Let me check the options. The options are A)88, B)89, C)90, D)91, E)92. So the correct answer should be B)89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I'm getting the initial terms wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering F(n) where F(1)=1, F(2)=2, etc. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of ways for n steps is the (n+1)th term in the Fibonacci sequence starting from F(0)=0, F(1)=1.\n\nLet me try that approach. So if F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8, F(7)=13, F(8)=21, F(9)=34, F(10)=55, F(11)=89.\n\nWait, then for n=10, it's F(10+1) = F(11)=89. So that still holds. So I think B)89 is correct.\n",
