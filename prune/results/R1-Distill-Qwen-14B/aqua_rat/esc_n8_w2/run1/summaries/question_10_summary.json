      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this math problem. Let's read it again. The question is about a salesperson who gets a 10% commission on each sale. I need to find out how many sales of $250 each he must make to reach a salary of at least $1000. The options are A to E, with numbers ranging from 15 to 52.\n\nHmm, right. So commission is based on the sales he makes. Each sale is $250, and the commission rate is 10%. So for each sale, he earns 10% of 250. Let me calculate that first. \n\n10% of 250 is 0.10 * 250. Let me do that: 0.10 * 250 equals 25. So for each sale, he makes $25.\n\nHe wants his total salary to be at least $1000. So we need to find the number of sales (let's call it 'n') such that 25 * n is greater than or equal to 1000.\n\nSo the equation is 25n \u2265 1000. To find n, I can divide both sides by 25.\n\nn \u2265 1000 / 25. Let me calculate that. 1000 divided by 25. Hmm, 25 times 40 is 1000. So 1000/25 is 40. So n must be at least 40.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So each sale gives $25, right? So 40 sales would give 40 * 25 = 1000. So yes, exactly 1000. But the question says \"at least $1000\". So 40 sales would give exactly 1000, which meets the condition.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 40. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the numbers because sometimes I might have miscalculated. Let me go through again.\n\nEach sale is $250, 10% of that is $25. So per sale, he gets $25. To get $1000, he needs 1000 / 25 = 40. So yes, 40 sales. So the correct answer is D)40.\n",

Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem is about a salesperson who gets a 10% commission on each sale. They need to find out how many sales of $250 each are required for the salary to be at least $1000. The options are given as A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52.\n\nHmm, so first, I think I should understand what a commission is. From what I remember, commission is like a percentage of the sales that the salesperson earns as their pay. So if they make a sale of, say, $100 and their commission rate is 10%, they get $10. Right?\n\nIn this case, the commission rate is 10%, and each sale is $250. So for each sale, the commission would be 10% of 250. Let me calculate that. 10% of 250 is 0.10 * 250 = $25. So each sale gives them $25.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach a salary of at least $1000. So I think I need to find the number of sales needed so that the total commission is $1000 or more.\n\nWait, is the question asking for the minimum number of sales? Yes, because it's saying \"at least $1000.\" So the total commission should be \u2265 $1000.\n\nLet me set this up as an equation. Let's say the number of sales is 'n'. Each sale gives $25 in commission, so the total commission is 25 * n. We want this to be \u22651000.\n\nSo the inequality is: 25n \u2265 1000.\n\nTo find n, I can divide both sides by 25. So n \u2265 1000 / 25.\n\nCalculating 1000 divided by 25. Hmm, 25 times 40 is 1000, right? Because 25*40=1000. So n must be \u226540. So the salesperson needs to make at least 40 sales.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If each sale is $250, 10% is $25 per sale. 40 sales would give 40 *25 = $1000. So that's exactly 1000. But the question says \"at least\" $1000, so 40 sales would reach exactly 1000. So that's the minimum number needed.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 40. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. What if I considered the total sales and then the commission? Another way to think about it: each sale is $250, so n sales would be n*250. The commission is 10% of that, which is 0.10*(n*250). So that's 25n, same as before.\n\nSo the equation is 25n \u2265 1000 \u2192 n\u226540. So yeah, 40 sales. So the correct answer is D)40.\n",
