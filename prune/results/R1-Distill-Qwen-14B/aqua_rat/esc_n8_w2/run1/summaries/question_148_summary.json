      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question here about logarithms. The question is asking for the value of log base 2 of 4. Hmm, I remember logarithms are the inverses of exponentials, right? So, log base 2 of 4 is like asking, \"2 raised to what power gives me 4?\" \n\nLet me think. I know that 2 squared is 4 because 2 times 2 equals 4. So if the base is 2 and the result is 4, the exponent must be 2. So log2(4) should be 2. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 2. So that should be the correct answer. I don't think I'm mixing up any steps here. Wait, just to make sure. Another way to think about it is using the logarithm formula. The formula is log_b(a) = c if b^c = a. So here, b is 2, a is 4, and we're solving for c. 2^c =4. We know that 2^2=4, so c is 2. Yep, that confirms it. So the answer must be A.\n",

Oh right, because logarithms answer the question: to what exponent should the base be raised to get the number?\n\nSo 2 to the power of 2 is 4. Because 2*2=4.
