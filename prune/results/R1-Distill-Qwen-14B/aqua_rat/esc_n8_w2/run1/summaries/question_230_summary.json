      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this algebra problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. The question says: If 6x minus y equals 24 and y equals 3x, what is the value of x? The options are A)8, B)9, C)10, D)11, E)12.\n\nHmm, I remember from my classes that when you have two equations with the same variables, you can use substitution or elimination to find the solution. In this case, since the second equation gives y directly in terms of x, substitution seems like the way to go.\n\nSo, the first equation is 6x - y = 24. And the second equation is y = 3x. Since I know y is 3x, I can substitute that into the first equation. Let me write that out.\n\nSubstituting y in the first equation, it becomes 6x - (3x) = 24. Wait, because y is 3x, so replacing y with 3x gives that.\n\nNow, simplifying that: 6x minus 3x is 3x. So, 3x equals 24. To find x, I just divide both sides by 3. So, 3x/3 is x, and 24/3 is 8. So x equals 8.\n\nWait a minute, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me plug the value back into the original equations to verify.\n\nIf x is 8, then y is 3 times 8, which is 24. Let's check the first equation: 6x - y. 6*8 is 48, and y is 24. 48 minus 24 is 24. That's correct because the first equation is equal to 24. So that works.\n\nLet me check the options again. Option A is 8. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but another thought: sometimes I might mix up the substitution. Did I substitute correctly? The first equation is 6x - y =24. I replaced y with 3x, so yes, that's correct. 6x minus 3x is 3x, equals 24, so x=8. Yep, that's right.\n\nI think I'm confident that A)8 is the right answer.\n",

Hmm, that sounds like a system of equations. I remember from class that when you have two equations with the same variables, you can solve them together, maybe by substitution or elimination. \n\nSince one of the equations is already solved for y, substitution might be easier. Let me think about substitution. So, in substitution, you take one equation and solve for one variable and then plug that into the other equation.
