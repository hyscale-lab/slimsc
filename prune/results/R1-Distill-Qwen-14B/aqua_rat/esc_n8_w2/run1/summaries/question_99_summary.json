      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where Meenu tells Silu her weight in a bit of a tricky way. I need to figure out how much Meenu actually weighs based on what she said. Let's break this down.\n\nThe problem says Meenu replied, \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. So she's not giving her weight directly but using an equation. Let me try to translate her words into a mathematical equation because that might make it easier to solve.\n\nSo, if I let Meenu's weight be represented by W, her statement would be: W equals 29 plus half of W. Because she said, \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" So the equation would be:\n\nW = 29 + (1/2)W\n\nNow, I need to solve for W. Let's see. Let me write that down:\n\nW = 29 + (1/2)W\n\nTo solve for W, I should get all the terms involving W on one side. So I'll subtract (1/2)W from both sides to get the W terms together.\n\nW - (1/2)W = 29\n\nHmm, what's W minus half of W? That's like (1 - 0.5)W, which is 0.5W. So:\n\n0.5W = 29\n\nNow, to find W, I can divide both sides by 0.5. Or, since 0.5 is the same as 1/2, I can multiply both sides by 2.\n\n0.5W / 0.5 = 29 / 0.5  \nWhich is the same as:\nW = 29 * 2  \nSo W = 58.\n\nWait, that would make Meenu's weight 58 kg. Looking at the options, D is 58. So the answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Did I set up the equation correctly? Meenu says she weighs 29 plus half her weight. So yes, W = 29 + (1/2)W. Solving that gives 58.\n\nAnother way to think about it: if half her weight is 29, then her full weight would be 58. Because if W = 29 + (W/2), then subtracting W/2 from both sides gives W/2 =29, so W=58. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nSo the correct answer is D)58.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Silu and Meenu. Let's see what it's asking. Silu says she weighs 51 kg and asks Meenu her weight. Meenu doesn't want to say directly, but she gives a clue: \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. I need to figure out what Meenu's actual weight is.\n\nWait, so Meenu says her weight is 29 kg plus half of her weight. That sounds like a riddle. Let me think about how to translate that into an equation. Let's let Meenu's weight be represented by W. So according to her statement, W equals 29 plus half of W. Because she's saying her weight is 29 kg plus half of her own weight.\n\nSo the equation would be: W = 29 + (1/2) * W. Oh, okay, that makes sense. Now I need to solve for W.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation. Let's subtract (1/2)W from both sides to get all the W terms on one side. So, W - (1/2)W = 29. That simplifies to (1/2)W = 29. Then, to find W, I can multiply both sides by 2. So W = 29 * 2. That gives me W = 58.\n\nWait, but that's one of the options. Let me check the options again. The options are A)12, B)28, C)27, D)58, E)91. So D is 58, which matches my calculation.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes these riddles can be tricky. So if Meenu's weight is 58 kg, then half of her weight is 29. So 29 plus 29 is 58. That adds up correctly. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nBut wait a second, why is the option D 58? Because 58 is the weight I calculated. So the answer should be D. Let me think if there's any other way to interpret the statement.\n\nAnother way to look at it: Meenu says she weighs 29 kg plus half of her weight. So her weight is 29 plus half of herself. So yeah, that's the same equation as before. So I don't see any other way to interpret it. So I think D is correct.\n",
