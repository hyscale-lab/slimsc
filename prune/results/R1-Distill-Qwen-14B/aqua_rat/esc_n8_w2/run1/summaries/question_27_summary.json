      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about simple interest, and I need to figure out how much Rahul will pay back after 4 years. Hmm, let's see. I remember that simple interest is calculated using the formula I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years.\n\nThe problem says Rahul borrowed Rs. 500 at 6% per annum simple interest. He's going to pay it back after 4 years. So I think I need to calculate the interest for those 4 years and then add it to the principal to get the total amount he has to pay.\n\nLet me break it down. The principal P is 500, the rate R is 6%, which I should convert to a decimal, so 0.06. Time T is 4 years.\n\nSo the interest I = 500 * 0.06 * 4. Let me compute that. 500 times 0.06 is 30, right? Because 500 * 0.06 is like 500 * 6% which is 30. Then, 30 multiplied by 4 years would be 120. So the interest is 120 rupees.\n\nWait, so the total amount to pay back would be the principal plus interest. That's 500 + 120 = 620. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 620. So that must be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Did I calculate everything correctly? 6% of 500 is 30 per year. Over four years, 30 *4 is 120. So yes, 500 +120 is 620. So the correct option is C.\n",

Let's see what the question says.\n\nRahul borrowed Rs. 500 at 6% per annum simple interest. He needs to pay it back after 4 years. I need to find out how much he'll pay in total. Hmm, right, simple interest is calculated using the formula I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is principal, R is rate, and T is time.\n\nSo the principal here is 500 rupees. The rate is 6% per annum. Time is 4 years. Let me plug those numbers into the formula.\n\nWait, wait. R is 6%, so I think I need to convert that to a decimal. So 6% is 0.06. So R = 0.06.\n\nCalculating the interest: I = 500 * 0.06 * 4. Let me compute that step by step. 500 multiplied by 0.06 is 30. Because 500 * 0.06 = 30. Then, 30 multiplied by 4 is 120. So the interest over four years is 120 rupees.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Oh, right, because simple interest is calculated on the principal each year. So for each year, the interest is 500 * 0.06 = 30. Over four years, it's 30 *4 = 120. So that's correct.\n\nSo the total amount Rahul has to pay is the principal plus the interest. So 500 + 120 = 620 rupees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 620. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. 6% of 500 is 30 per year. 4 years would be 30 *4=120. 500+120=620. Yep, that's right. So the correct answer is C.\n",
