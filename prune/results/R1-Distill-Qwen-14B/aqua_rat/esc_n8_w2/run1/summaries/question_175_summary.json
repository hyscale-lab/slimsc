      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, a rope that's 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. One piece is 3 meters shorter than the other. I need to find the length of the longer piece.\n\nWait, okay, so the total length is 20 meters. Let me think about how to model this. Maybe I can use algebra. Let me assign variables to the lengths. Let's say the longer piece is x meters. Then the shorter one must be x minus 3 meters, because it's 3 meters shorter.\n\nSo, the two pieces are x and x-3. Together, they add up to 20 meters. So, I can set up an equation: x + (x -3) = 20. Let me write that down.\n\nx + x -3 =20. Combining like terms, that's 2x -3 =20. Hmm, solving for x. I'll add 3 to both sides. 2x = 23. Oh wait, wait, 20 plus 3 is 23, right? So 2x=23. Then x is 23 divided by 2. 23/2 is 11.5. So the longer piece is 11.5 meters.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If the longer piece is 11.5, the shorter is 11.5 -3=8.5. Adding them together, 11.5 +8.5=20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 11.5. So that's the answer.\n",
