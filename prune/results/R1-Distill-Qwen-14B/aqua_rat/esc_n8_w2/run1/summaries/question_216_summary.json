      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here: What is the units digit of 9 cubed minus 7? The options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)2, E)4. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that the units digit is the last digit of a number. So when you subtract or add numbers, the units digit of the result depends only on the units digits of the original numbers. That makes sense because higher digits don't affect the last digit. \n\nLet me break it down. The problem is 9^3 minus 7. So I'll compute each part separately and then subtract. \n\nStarting with 9 cubed. 9^1 is 9. 9^2 is 81, right? And 9^3 is 9 multiplied by 9^2, which is 9*81. Let me calculate that. 9 times 80 is 720, and 9 times 1 is 9, so 720 +9 = 729. So 9^3 is 729. \n\nNow the units digit of 729 is 9 because the last digit is 9. So the units digit of 9^3 is 9. \n\nNext, I need to subtract 7 from 729. Wait, but I'm only looking for the units digit of the result. So instead of subtracting the whole numbers, maybe I can just subtract the units digits. \n\nSo 729 has a units digit of 9, and 7 has a units digit of 7. So 9 minus 7 is 2. Therefore, the units digit of 729 - 7 should be 2. \n\nLooking back at the options, D is 2. So I think D is the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check my steps. \n\nWait, another way to think about this is to compute 9^3 -7 directly. 9^3 is 729, so 729 minus 7 is 722. The units digit of 722 is indeed 2. Yep, that matches. So the correct answer is D. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The calculation seems straightforward. Another approach: maybe using modular arithmetic? The units digit is the remainder when divided by 10. So 9^3 mod 10 is 9, and 7 mod 10 is 7. So 9 -7 mod 10 is 2. Same result. \n\nYeah, that's solid. So the answer must be D.\n",
