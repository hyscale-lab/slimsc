      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is: If 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of a number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. I need to find the number. The options are A)100, B)160, C)150, D)210, E)220.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. I'll try to translate the words into an equation. Let me call the number x.\n\nThe problem says, \"10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number.\" So that would be (2/3)x minus 10. And this equals the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. So the sum is 40 plus (1/3)x.\n\nPutting that together, the equation should be: (2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow I need to solve for x. Let me write that equation again:\n\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nI think the first step is to get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. So I'll subtract (1/3)x from both sides to eliminate it from the right.\n\n(2/3)x - (1/3)x -10 = 40.\n\nWait, (2/3)x minus (1/3)x is (1/3)x. So now the equation is:\n\n(1/3)x - 10 = 40.\n\nNext, I'll add 10 to both sides to get rid of the -10 on the left.\n\n(1/3)x = 50.\n\nNow, to solve for x, I'll multiply both sides by 3.\n\nx = 50 * 3.\n\nSo x is 150. Let me check the options. Option C is 150. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me plug 150 back into the original problem.\n\nTwo-thirds of 150 is (2/3)*150. Let's calculate that: 150 divided by 3 is 50, multiplied by 2 is 100. Then subtract 10: 100 - 10 =90.\n\nOn the other side, 40 plus one-third of 150. One-third of 150 is 50, so 40 +50=90. Yep, both sides are equal. So 150 is correct. Therefore, the answer is C.\n",
