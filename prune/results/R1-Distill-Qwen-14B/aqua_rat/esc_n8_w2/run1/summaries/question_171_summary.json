      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about magazine subscriptions and savings. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nThe question says that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, and this represents a 25% saving compared to buying each issue individually at the cover price. I need to find the cover price per issue. Hmm, so I guess the subscription is cheaper because it's a bulk purchase, so each issue is cheaper than the cover price, but by how much?\n\nWait, the saving is 25%. Oh right, so the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price. So the $42 is 75% of the total cover price for 15 issues. Because 100% minus 25% saving equals 75% of the original price.\n\nLet me structure this. Let's say the total cover price for 15 issues is X. The subscription is X minus 25% of X, which is 0.75X. And this is equal to $42. So 0.75X = $42. \n\nTo find X, I can rearrange that. X = 42 divided by 0.75. Let me calculate that. 42 divided by 0.75. Hmm, 0.75 is three-fourths, so 42 divided by 3/4 is the same as 42 multiplied by 4/3. 42 times 4 is 168, divided by 3 is 56. So X is $56.\n\nSo the total cover price for 15 issues is $56. Now, to find the cover price per issue, I divide 56 by 15. Let's do that. 56 divided by 15. Hmm, 15 times 3 is 45, 15 times 3.7 is 55.5, because 0.7 times 15 is 10.5. So 3.7 times 15 is 55.5. 56 minus 55.5 is 0.5, so that's 0.5/15, which is approximately 0.0333. So adding up, 3.7 + 0.0333 is about 3.7333. \n\nWait, so that's approximately $3.7333 per issue. Looking at the options, E is $3.73. But wait, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, 15 issues at the cover price sum to $56. So each issue is 56/15. Let me compute this precisely. 15 into 56. 15*3 is 45, 15*3.7 is 55.5, as before. So 56.00 minus 55.5 is 0.5. 0.5 divided by 15 is 0.0333... So 3.7 + 0.0333 is 3.7333, which is about $3.73 when rounded to the nearest cent. So E is the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check if I interpreted the 25% saving correctly. The problem says the subscription represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices. So the subscription is cheaper by 25% of the total cover price. So yes, that makes the subscription 75% of the total cover price. So yes, 42 = 0.75 * X, so X = 56.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the options don't have E as the first option. Let me see the options again. The options are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73. So E is the last option, $3.73. So according to my calculation, E is correct. But wait, let me think again. Maybe I should think about it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 25% saving is per issue. But that doesn't make much sense because the way it's phrased is \"represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices.\" I think that refers to the total saving, not per issue. So the total saving is 25% off the total cover price.\n\nWait, another approach: The total cover price is X, and the subscription is X minus 0.25X = 0.75X. So 0.75X = 42. X=56. So per issue, it's 56/15 \u22483.7333. So E is correct.\n\nBut wait, another thought. Maybe the 25% saving is per issue, so each issue is 25% cheaper. Then the subscription price per issue would be 75% of the cover price. Then total subscription is 15 * (0.75 * cover price per issue). Let's see what that would give.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the first approach, because if each issue is 25% off, then the total is 15 * (0.75 * cover per issue). So the total subscription is 15 * 0.75 * (cover per issue) = 11.25 * cover per issue. But the subscription is $42. So 11.25 * c =42 \u2192 c=42/11.25 = 3.7333. So same answer. Hmm.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is E, $3.73. But wait, why is the option C 5.73? Because perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recalculate 42 divided by 0.75. 42 / 0.75. 0.75 is 3/4, so 42 * (4/3) = (42/3)*4=14*4=56. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo total cover price is 56, per issue 56/15. Let me compute 56 \u00f715. 15 goes into 56 three times (3*15=45), remainder 11. Bring down a zero: 110. 15 goes into 110 seven times (105), remainder 5. Bring down a zero: 50. 15 goes into 50 three times (45), remainder 5. Bring down a zero: 50 again. So this is 3.7333... So 3.7333 is approximately $3.73. So option E is correct.\n",
