      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a square piece of cloth. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on.\n\nSo, the cloth is square. Then, it's trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, making it a rectangle. After that, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half, creating two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. I need to find the perimeter of the original square.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original shape is a square. Let me call the side length of the square 's'. So, the area of the square is s squared, s\u00b2.\n\nThen, it's trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. Wait, does that mean that one side becomes s - 4, and the other remains s? Because trimming 4 feet from one edge would reduce the length of that edge by 4, making it a rectangle with sides s and (s-4). Wait, no, wait. Because if it's a square, all sides are equal. So, if you trim 4 feet from one edge, that edge becomes s-4, and the other edge remains s. So the rectangle's dimensions are s and (s-4).\n\nWait, but wait a second\u2014could it be that when you trim one edge, the other edge is the same? So the original is a square, say 10x10. If you trim 4 feet on one edge, you get a rectangle that's 10x6, right? Because 10-4 is 6.\n\nSo after trimming, the rectangle has sides of s and (s-4). Then, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half, resulting in two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70. So, the area of the rectangle must be twice that, which is 140.\n\nWait, because each triangle is half of the rectangle. So the area of the rectangle is 140. So, the area of the rectangle is s*(s-4) = 140.\n\nSo the equation is s(s-4) = 140.\n\nLet me write that down: s^2 -4s = 140 \u2192 s^2 -4s -140 = 0.\n\nI need to solve for s. Let's use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0. The coefficients are a=1, b=-4, c=-140.\n\nThe quadratic formula is s = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)] / (2a).\n\nPlugging in the numbers: b\u00b2 is 16. 4ac is 4*1*(-140) = -560. So the discriminant is 16 + 560 = 576. The square root of 576 is 24.\n\nSo s = [4 \u00b124]/2. We can ignore the negative solution because length can't be negative. So (4+24)/2 = 28/2=14. So s is 14 feet.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So the original square has sides of 14 feet. So the perimeter is 4 times 14, which is 56 feet. But wait, looking at the options, option A is 56. But wait, the options are A)56, B)58, C)60, D)62, E)64.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, the area of the rectangle is s*(s-4) = 140. So 14 *10 = 140, which is correct. So s=14.\n\nPerimeter is 4*14=56. So the answer should be A)56.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me think again. When the square is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, are both the length and the width of the rectangle s and s-4? Or is it s-4 and s? Because the square has four edges, so trimming on one edge would reduce that edge's length by 4, but the other edges remain the same. So yes, the rectangle is s by (s-4).\n\nWait, but let me think about the rectangle's area. The area is 140, which is s(s-4) =140.\n\nWait, s=14 gives 14*(10)=140. That's correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says after trimming, the cloth is rectangular. Then, it's cut diagonally in half, creating two triangles. Each triangle has area 70.\n\nWait, the area of each triangle is 70, so two triangles make 140. So that's correct.\n\nSo the perimeter of the original square is 4*14=56. So the answer is option A.\n\nBut wait, wait another moment. Let me think again. Did I make any mistake in the setup?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's say the original square has side s. After trimming 4 feet on one edge, the rectangle's dimensions are (s) and (s-4). So area is s*(s-4). Then, this rectangle is cut into two triangles along the diagonal. Each triangle's area is (s*(s-4))/2 =70. So s*(s-4) = 140. So that's correct.\n\nWait, yes. So s\u00b2-4s-140=0. The solutions are [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 560)]/2. 16+560=576. sqrt(576)=24. So (4+24)/2=28/2=14.\n\nSo s=14, perimeter is 4*14=56, which is option A.\n\nHmm, so why is the option C)60? Maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I misread the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says the cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. So perhaps the original square is s, and after trimming, the new rectangle is (s-4) by s. But wait, no, that's the same as before. Or perhaps the trimming is on both edges? No, the problem says 'on one edge'. So only one edge is trimmed by 4 feet. So the rectangle is s by (s-4). So my initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area of the triangle. Let me think again. The rectangle is cut diagonally, so each triangle has half the area of the rectangle. So each triangle's area is 70, so the rectangle's area is 140. So the equation is s*(s-4)=140. Correct.\n\nSo s\u00b2 -4s -140=0 \u2192 s=14. Perimeter is 4*14=56. So the answer is A)56.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 56 as the correct answer? No, the options are A)56, B)58, etc. So 56 is option A. So the answer is A.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought 56 seems low. Let me make sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe I misread the problem. Let me read again.\n\nThe square is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle. So original square has side s. Trim 4 feet on one edge, so the rectangle is (s-4) by s. Then, cut diagonally into two triangles. Each triangle's area is 70.\n\nSo area of the rectangle is 2 *70=140. So (s)(s-4) =140. Which is correct.\n\nSo s\u00b2 -4s -140=0. Using quadratic formula, s=(4+sqrt(16+560))/2=(4+24)/2=14. So s=14.\n\nPerimeter of square is 4*14=56. So the answer is A.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So why is option C)60 an option? Oh wait, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, another thought: Could it be that the square is trimmed on two edges, each by 4 feet? No, the problem says trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, so only one edge is reduced.\n\nSo I think my initial approach is correct. Therefore, the answer is A)56.\n",

Hmm.\n\nAlright, let's break it down step by step. First, the cloth is square, so all sides are equal. Let's call the original length of each side 'x' feet. So, the original area would be x squared, right?\n\nThen, the cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. Wait, when it says \"trimmed by 4 feet on one edge\", does that mean one side becomes shorter by 4 feet? Because trimming one edge would reduce that side's length. So, if the original square is x by x, trimming one edge by 4 would make that side (x-4) feet. But wait, which edge? Oh, it's trimmed on one edge, so maybe it's only one side that's reduced by 4. So, the resulting shape is a rectangle with sides x and (x-4).

So, x= [4 \u00b124]/2. \n\nSo, two solutions: (4+24)/2 =28/2=14, and (4-24)/2= -20/2=-10. Since length can't be negative, x=14 feet.

Yep, that's correct. So, the original perimeter is 4*14=56. So the answer should be A)56.\n\n\nThe problem involves a square piece of cloth with side length \\( x \\) feet. After trimming one edge by 4 feet, the cloth becomes a rectangle with dimensions \\( x \\) and \\( x-4 \\). The area of this rectangle is \\( x(x-4) \\). Since the rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles, each with an area of 70 square feet, the total area of the rectangle is \\( 2 \\times 70 = 140 \\) square feet. Thus, the equation \\( x(x-4) = 140 \\) must be solved.\n\nExpanding and rearranging gives the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x - 140 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -140 \\), we calculate:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 560}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{576}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 24}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis yields two solutions: \\( x = 14 \\) and \\( x = -10 \\). Since the side length cannot be negative, \\( x = 14 \\) feet. The original square had a perimeter of \\( 4x = 4 \\times 14 = 56 \\) feet.\n\nThus, the perimeter of the original square cloth is **56 feet**.\n\nAnswer: A",
