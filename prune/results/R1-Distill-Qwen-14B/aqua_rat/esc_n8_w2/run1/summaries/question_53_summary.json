      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of word problems. But I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nThe question is: Five dozen toys are packed in a box and 98 boxes are kept in a tempo. How many tempos can lift 29400 toys in one round? The options are A)4, B)5, C)7, D)6, E)8.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out how many toys are in each box and then how many boxes each tempo can carry. Wait, no, wait. The first part says five dozen toys are packed in a box. So one box holds five dozen toys. A dozen is 12, right? So five dozen is 5 * 12. Let me calculate that: 5 *12=60. So each box has 60 toys.\n\nNext part: 98 boxes are kept in a tempo. So each tempo can carry 98 boxes. But each box has 60 toys, so I guess each tempo can carry 98 boxes * 60 toys per box. Let me compute that: 98 * 60. Hmm, 100 *60 would be 6000, but that's 2 more than 98, so subtract 2*60=120. So 6000-120=5880. So each tempo can carry 5880 toys in one round.\n\nNow the question is, how many tempos are needed to lift 29400 toys in one round? So I need to find how many times 5880 goes into 29400. That is, 29400 divided by 5880. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, maybe I can simplify this division. Let's see. 29400 \u00f7 5880. Hmm, both numbers end with two zeros, so I can divide numerator and denominator by 100 to make it easier: 294 \u00f758.8. Wait, but decimals might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can factor both numbers.\n\nLet me think about the factors. 5880 is 588 * 10. 588 is 588, which is 588= let's see, 588 divided by 12 is 49. Because 12*49=588. So 5880 is 12*49*10. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to see how many times 5880 fits into 29400.\n\nWait, another approach: 5880 multiplied by what gives 29400? Let me see. 5880 * 5 is 29400, because 5000 *5=25000, 880*5=4400, so 25000+4400=29400. Oh wait, so 5880 *5 = 29400. So that would mean 5 tempos are needed because each tempo carries 5880 toys. So 5 tempos carry 5*5880=29400.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So 5 tempos each carrying 5880 toys: 5 *5880 = 29400, which matches the total needed. So the answer should be 5, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, wait another thing. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculations. Did I correctly compute how many toys each tempo can carry? Because that's crucial.\n\nEach box has 60 toys. Each tempo holds 98 boxes. So 98 boxes *60 toys each = 5880 toys per tempo. Yeah, that's correct. So 5 tempos would carry 5 *5880 =29400. So yeah, that's correct.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, first determine how many toys each box holds. Since there are five dozen toys in a box and one dozen equals 12, each box contains:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 12 = 60 \\text{ toys}.\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate how many toys a single tempo can carry. Each tempo holds 98 boxes, and each box contains 60 toys. Therefore, the number of toys a tempo can carry is:\n\n\\[\n98 \\times 60 = 5880 \\text{ toys}.\n\\]\n\nNow, determine how many tempos are needed to carry a total of 29,400 toys.
