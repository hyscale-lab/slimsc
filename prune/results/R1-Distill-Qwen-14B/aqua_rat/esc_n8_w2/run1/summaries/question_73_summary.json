      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the perimeter of a rectangle. Hmm, I remember that perimeter is the total distance around the shape. Right, so for a rectangle, I think the formula is something like adding up all the sides. Wait, yeah, I think the formula is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. Or maybe it's 2*(length + width). Oh right, that's the same thing because 2l + 2w is the same as 2(l + w). So the formula is 2*(l + w).\n\nThe problem says the length is 8 centimeters and the width is 3 centimeters. So let me plug those numbers into the formula. So l is 8, w is 3. Then, 2*(8 + 3) would be the calculation. Let me compute that. 8 plus 3 is 11, and then multiplied by 2 gives 22. So the perimeter is 22 centimeters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 22cm. So that should be the correct answer. Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. Each pair of opposite sides in a rectangle are equal. So there are two lengths and two widths. So two times 8 is 16, and two times 3 is 6. Adding those together, 16 +6 is 22. Yep, that's right. So the perimeter is definitely 22 centimeters. So the answer should be B.\n",

Oh right, for a rectangle, the formula should be something like adding up all the sides.\n\nWait, rectangles have two pairs of equal sides. So, the opposite sides are the same. That means if the length is 8 cm, the opposite side is also 8 cm. And the width is 3 cm, so the other two sides are 3 cm each. So to find the perimeter, I think I need to add all four sides together. Or maybe there's a shortcut formula I can use.\n\nOh right, the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2*(length + width). Yeah, that makes sense because you're adding the two lengths and the two widths. So plugging in the numbers, length is 8 and width is 3. So 8 plus 3 is 11. Then multiply that by 2. 11 times 2 is 22.
