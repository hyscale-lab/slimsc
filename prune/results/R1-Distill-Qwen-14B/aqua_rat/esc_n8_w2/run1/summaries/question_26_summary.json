      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a retailer selling an appliance. Hmm, let's see. The question says the retailer sold it for 40 percent above cost, and that 40 percent represents a gross profit of $20.00. I need to find out the selling price. The options are A to E, with various dollar amounts.\n\nWait, wait. Let me break this down. So, the cost price is what the retailer paid for the appliance, right? And then they sold it at 40% above that cost. The difference between the selling price and the cost is the gross profit, which is $20 here.\n\nSo, let me denote the cost price as 'C'. The selling price would then be C plus 40% of C, which is 1.4 times C. Or, another way, Selling Price = C * 1.4.\n\nThe profit is the selling price minus the cost. So, Profit = 1.4C - C = 0.4C. And the problem says that this profit is $20. So, 0.4C = $20.\n\nOh wait, right. So to find C, I can rearrange that. C = $20 / 0.4. Let's calculate that. 20 divided by 0.4 is... 20 / 0.4 = 50. So the cost price is $50.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the selling price. Oh right, because the selling price is 40% above cost. So Selling Price = C + 0.4C = 1.4 * C. Which would be 1.4 * 50. Let's compute that. 1.4 * 50 is 70. So the selling price is $70.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is $70.00. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If the cost is $50, then 40% of 50 is 20, so the selling price is 50 +20 =70. Yeah, that's correct. So the profit is $20, which matches the problem statement.\n",

Let's see, the problem says the retailer sold it for 40 percent above cost, and that represented a gross profit of $20.00. Oh wait, so the profit is $20, and that's 40% above the cost. \n\nWait, wait. I should clarify what \"40 percent above cost\" means. So, when they say they sold it 40% above cost, that probably means the selling price is 40% higher than the cost price. So if the cost is, say, C dollars, then the selling price S is C plus 40% of C. Alternatively, S = C + 0.4C = 1.4C. \n\nBut the problem also mentions that this 40% above cost equals a gross profit of $20. Gross profit is usually calculated as selling price minus cost price. So, profit = S - C. But in this case, they say that this profit is $20. \n\nWait, but according to the way they phrased it, the 40% is the profit margin. Because when you sell something for a certain percentage above cost, that percentage is usually the profit margin. So, 40% above cost would mean that the profit is 40% of the cost. Because profit is the amount over cost. \n\nSo, if the profit is 40% of cost, then profit = 0.4 * C. And that's equal to $20. So, 0.4C = 20. Then, solving for C, I divide both sides by 0.4. So C = 20 / 0.4. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 0.4 is 50. So the cost price is $50.\n\nNow, the selling price is 40% above the cost. So S = C + 0.4C = 1.4C. Plugging in C = 50, S = 1.4 * 50. Let me do that math: 1.4 times 50 is 70. So the selling price is $70.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is $70.00. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If the cost is $50 and the selling price is $70, the profit is $20, which is 40% of 50. Yep, that makes sense. So yes, D is correct.\n",
