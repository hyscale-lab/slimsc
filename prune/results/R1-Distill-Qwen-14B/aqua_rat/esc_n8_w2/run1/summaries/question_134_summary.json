      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the total bus fare for a group of people. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that the bus fare for one adult is Rs. 140 from Ranchi to Patna. And the child's fare is half of that adult fare. I need to find the total fare for 4 adults and 3 children.\n\nWait, right, so first I should calculate the child's fare. Since it's half of the adult's, I can do 140 divided by 2. Let me do that: 140 / 2 equals 70. So each child's ticket is Rs. 70.\n\nNow, I need to find the total cost. That means I'll have to calculate the cost for the adults and the cost for the children separately and then add them together.\n\nFor the adults: There are 4 adults, each paying Rs. 140. So I multiply 4 by 140. Let me compute that: 4 * 140. Hmm, 140 times 4 is 560. So the total for adults is 560 rupees.\n\nFor the children: There are 3 children, each paying Rs. 70. So 3 multiplied by 70. That's 210. So the children's total is 210 rupees.\n\nAdding both amounts together: 560 (adults) + 210 (children) = 770. Wait, that's a total of 770 rupees.\n\nNow I look at the options. Option E is Rs.770, so that should be the correct answer. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAdult fare: 140 *4 = 560. Correct. Child fare: 70 *3=210. Correct. Sum: 560+210=770. Yep, that's right. So the answer must be E.\n",

Hmm, I think I can break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the adult fare is Rs. 140. The child fare is half of that. So, I need to calculate the child's fare first. Let me do that: half of 140 is 70. So each child ticket is Rs. 70.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the total fare for 4 adults and 3 children. That means I have to calculate the total for the adults and the total for the children separately and then add them together.\n\nLet me start with the adults. Each adult is 140, and there are 4 of them. So 4 multiplied by 140. Let me compute that. 4 times 140... 4*100 is 400, and 4*40 is 160. Adding those together gives 560. So the total for adults is 560 rupees.\n\nNext, the children's fare. Each child is 70, and there are 3. So 3 times 70. 3*70 is 210. So the children's total is 210 rupees.\n\nNow, adding both totals together: 560 (adults) + 210 (children) equals... 560 plus 200 is 760, plus 10 more is 770. Wait, but let me double-check that addition. 560 plus 200 is indeed 760, plus 10 is 770. So the total fare is 770 rupees.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is Rs. 770. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait a second, wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Did I calculate the child's fare correctly? Yes, half of 140 is 70. Then 4 adults: 4 *140=560. 3 children:3*70=210. Sum is 560+210=770. Yep, that looks right. So the answer must be E.\n",
