      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this age-related problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. The sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. We need to find the definite difference between R and Q's age. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. So, the first sentence is a bit tricky. \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.\" I think this means that the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. So, if I denote the ages as Q, R, T, then the difference R - Q equals Q - T. Wait, because Q is younger than R, so R is older than Q by some amount, and Q is older than T by the same amount. So, yes, R - Q = Q - T. That makes sense.\n\nSo, let's write that equation. R - Q = Q - T. Let me rearrange this to find another form. Adding Q to both sides and adding T to both sides, I get R + T = 2Q. Oh, interesting. Because R - Q = Q - T implies R + T = 2Q. \n\nWait, the problem also says that the sum of R and T's ages is 50. So, R + T = 50. From the equation I just derived, R + T = 2Q. So substituting, 2Q = 50. That would mean Q = 25. Oh, so Q is 25 years old.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. So, the difference is R - Q. But from the earlier equation, R - Q = Q - T. So if I can find R - Q, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, since I know R + T = 50 and R - Q = Q - T, maybe I can find R and T's values in terms of Q.\n\nWait, let's think again. I have R + T = 50 and R - Q = Q - T. Let me write these two equations:\n\n1) R + T = 50\n\n2) R - Q = Q - T \u2192 rearranged as R + T = 2Q.\n\nSo, equation 2 tells me that 2Q = 50. Therefore, Q = 25.\n\nSo Q is 25. Now, the problem is to find the difference between R and Q's age, which is R - Q.\n\nBut I don't have the values for R or T individually. I only know their sum is 50. So, let me see if I can express R in terms of Q or T.\n\nFrom equation 2, R = 2Q - T. Wait, but since R + T = 50, substituting R as 2Q - T would give 2Q - T + T = 50 \u2192 2Q =50, which we already know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find R - Q.\n\nWe know R - Q = Q - T \u2192 let's call this difference x. So, x = Q - T and x = R - Q.\n\nSo, x is the same in both cases. Since Q is 25, let's express T as Q - x \u2192 T = 25 - x.\n\nSimilarly, R = Q + x \u2192 R =25 +x.\n\nBut R + T is 50. So substituting R and T:\n\n(25 +x) + (25 -x) =50 \u2192 50=50. Hmm, that's an identity, which means it's always true regardless of x. So, this doesn't help me find x because x can be any value, right?\n\nWait, that can't be. Because x is R - Q, which is the same as Q - T. But without more information, like individual ages, x could be any value. So, I can't determine the exact value of x, meaning the difference between R and Q can't be determined from the given information.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because I know R + T =50 and R = Q + x, T = Q -x. So substituting, (Q +x) + (Q -x) =2Q =50 \u2192 Q=25. So, R =25 +x, T=25 -x.\n\nSo, the difference between R and Q is x, and the difference between Q and T is x. But since R and T could be any values as long as they average to 25, the difference x isn't fixed. For example, if R is 30, T is 20, then x is 5. If R is 35, T is15, x is10. So, x can vary. Therefore, the difference between R and Q isn't fixed\u2014it can be any number. So, we can't determine the exact difference; thus, the answer would be that it cannot be determined.\n\nWait, but the options don't include 'Cannot be determined' as D, but the options are:\n\nA)22\n\nB)27\n\nC)29\n\nD)Cannot be determined\n\nE)None of the above.\n\nSo, since we can't determine x, the answer is D.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me check my reasoning again. Because the question is asking for the definite difference between R and Q. So, if R + T =50, and R - Q = Q - T, we have 2Q=50, so Q=25. Then R =25 +x, T=25 -x. But we don't have more info to find x. So, the difference R-Q is x, which can vary based on R and T's ages as long as R + T =50. So, x isn't determined, so the answer is D.\n",

So, the question says, \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.\" Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful, but I'll break it down.\n\nFirst, I think I should translate the words into mathematical equations. Let me assign variables to each person's age: let Q be Q's age, R be R's age, and T be T's age.\n\nThe statement says Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. Let me write that as equations. \n\nIf Q is younger than R, that means R is older than Q by some number of years. Let's call that difference 'x'. So, R = Q + x. Similarly, since Q is older than T, the difference between Q and T is also 'x'. So, T = Q - x. Wait, no, because if Q is older than T by x, then T would be Q - x. Right, because if Q is bigger, subtracting x would give T's age.\n\nSo, R = Q + x and T = Q - x.\n\nNow, the problem also states that the sum of R and T's ages is 50 years. So, R + T = 50. Let's substitute the expressions for R and T we have from before.\n\nSubstituting, we get (Q + x) + (Q - x) = 50. Let's simplify that. The x and -x would cancel out, so Q + Q = 50. That's 2Q = 50. So, Q = 25.\n\nWait, so Q's age is 25. But the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. From earlier, we have R = Q + x. So, R - Q = x. But from the equation R + T = 50, and knowing R and T in terms of Q and x, but we found that the x terms canceled out, so maybe we don't have enough information to find x?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. We have R = Q + x and T = Q - x. Adding them gives R + T = (Q + x) + (Q - x) = 2Q. So, R + T = 2Q. And we know that R + T is 50, so 2Q = 50, which gives Q =25. \n\nSo, Q is 25. Now, R is Q + x, so R =25 +x. Similarly, T is 25 -x. But without knowing x, can we find R - Q? Because R - Q is x. But the question asks for the difference between R and Q's age, which is x. But we don't have any other equations to find x.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. So that's x. But from the given information, can we find x? Let me see.\n\nWait, the only other equation we have is R + T =50, which we already used to find Q=25. So without any more info, x can be any number, right? Because if I plug in x=10, then R=35 and T=15. If x=20, R=45 and T=5. So, x could be anything, as long as R and T's ages are positive. So, the difference between R and Q is x, but we don't know what x is. So, the problem is asking, what is definitely the difference between R and Q's age? But without knowing x, we can't determine a specific number. So, the answer must be that it cannot be determined from the given information.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. The problem says Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, R is x years older than Q, and T is x years younger than Q. So, the difference between R and Q is x, and the difference between Q and T is x. So, the difference between R and T would be R - T = (Q+x) - (Q -x) )= 2x. So, R and T's ages differ by 2x. But the sum of R and T is 50, which we used to find Q=25. \n\nBut without knowing R and T's individual ages or the difference between R and T, we can't find x. Because we only have R + T =50, but R and T could be any pair of numbers that add up to 50, and their difference is 2x. So, 2x could be any even number, but without knowing R and T's ages, x could be any number. Hence, the difference between R and Q's age is x, which is unknown. So, the answer is that we cannot determine the difference between R and Q's age based on the given information.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D is \"Cannot be determined.\" So the answer should be D.\n",
