      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nA shopkeeper gave a 20% discount on all items for one day. Now he has to sell them at the original price the next day. The question is asking by what percentage he must increase the discounted price to get back to the original price. The options are A)21%, B)20%, C)25%, D)33%, E)18%.\n\nHmm. So, I think I remember that when you have a discount and then need to reverse it, the percentage increase isn't the same as the discount percentage. Because percentages are based on different starting points.\n\nLet me think with numbers. Maybe that'll help. Let's assume the original price of an item is $100. It's a nice round number, easy to calculate.\n\nSo, if the original price is $100 and there's a 20% discount, the discounted price becomes $80. Because 20% of 100 is 20, subtract that and you get 80.\n\nNow, the next day, the shopkeeper wants to sell it back at the original price, which is $100. But the discounted price was $80. So, he needs to increase $80 to $100. How much of a percentage increase is that?\n\nThe formula for percentage increase is ((New Price - Original Price) / Original Price) * 100%. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in this case, the original price after discount is $80, and he wants to go back to $100. So the increase is from 80 to 100. So the increase amount is 20.\n\nSo the percentage increase is (20 / 80) * 100%. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 80 is 0.25, times 100 is 25%. So the percentage increase needed is 25%, right?\n\nWait, but why can't it be 20% again? Because 20% of 80 is 16, which would bring it to 96, not 100. So that's not enough. So 25% is the correct increase.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 25%, so that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Suppose the original price is P. After 20% discount, the price is 0.8P. To get back to P, what percentage do you add to 0.8P?\n\nLet the required percentage be x. So, 0.8P * (1 + x) = P. Divide both sides by 0.8P, we get 1 + x = 1 / 0.8. 1/0.8 is 1.25. So x is 0.25, which is 25%. Yep, that's correct.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the percentage increase needed to return to the original price after a 20% discount, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Assume the original price of an item is $100**.  \n   - After a 20% discount, the price becomes:  \n     \\[\n     100 - 0.2 \\times 100 = 80 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n     \\]\n\n2. **The goal is to increase the discounted price ($80) back to the original price ($100)**.  \n   - The amount of increase needed is:  \n     \\[\n     100 - 80 = 20 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the percentage increase** using the formula:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Increase Amount}}{\\text{Original Discounted Price}}\\right) \\times 100\\%.\n   \\]  \n   Substituting the values:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left(\\frac{20}{80}\\right) \\times 100\\% = 0.25 \\times 100\\% = 25\\%.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification**:  \n   - If the discounted price ($80) is increased by 25%, the new price is:  \n     \\[\n     80 + 0.25 \\times 80 = 100 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n     \\]  \n   This confirms that a 25% increase is correct.\n\nThus, the shopkeeper must increase the discounted price by **25%** to return to the original price.\n\nAnswer: C",

The question is asking by what percentage he must increase the discounted price to get back to the original price. \n\nWait, so on the first day, everything was 20% off. Let me think about how that affects the price. If the original price is, say, $100, then a 20% discount would make it $80. Because 20% of 100 is 20, so 100 minus 20 is 80. So the discounted price is $80.\n\nNow, the next day, he wants to go back to the original $100. So he's currently selling at $80, and he wants to increase this to $100. The question is, what percentage increase from $80 will bring it to $100?\n\nI remember that percentage increase is calculated by (New Price - Old Price)/Old Price * 100%. So in this case, the old price after discount is $80, and the new price is $100.\n\nSo the increase is 100 - 80 = 20. Then, 20 divided by 80 is 0.25. Multiply by 100 to get percentage, so 25%. So the increase needed is 25%.\n\nLet me check the options. Option C is 25%, so that should be the answer.\n\nWait, another way to think about it. If the price drops by 20%, it's like multiplying the original by 0.8. To get back, you need to find a multiplier x such that 0.8 * x = 1. So x is 1/0.8 = 1.25. That's a 25% increase. Yep, that matches what I thought earlier.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)25%.\n",
