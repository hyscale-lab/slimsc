      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here, and I need to figure out how much money John has. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nMark told John, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" Then John says, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So both are making statements about what would happen if they give each other certain amounts of money. And I need to find out how much John has.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a system of equations problem. Let me try to break it down. I think I should assign variables to the amounts of money each person has. Let's say:\n\nLet M be the amount of money Mark has.\nLet J be the amount John has.\n\nSo, first statement: If John gives half his money to Mark, Mark will have Rs.75. Wait, no, wait. Wait, Mark says, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So that's Mark's perspective. So John gives half of his money to Mark. So after that, Mark's money becomes M + (J/2), and John's money becomes J - (J/2) = J/2. But Mark's total after that is 75. So equation one is:\n\nM + (J/2) = 75.\n\nOkay, that's the first equation.\n\nNow, the second statement is John's. He says, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So this is from John's perspective. So Mark gives one third of his money to John. So after that, Mark's money is M - (M/3) = (2M/3), and John's money is J + (M/3). And John's total is 75. So equation two is:\n\nJ + (M/3) = 75.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. John is saying that if Mark gives him one third of Mark's money, John will have 75. So Mark gives (M/3) to John. So John's new amount is J + (M/3) =75.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) M + (J/2) =75\n2) J + (M/3)=75\n\nSo now I can solve these two equations to find J.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEquation 1: M + (J/2) =75\nEquation 2: J + (M/3) =75\n\nI can rearrange both equations to express M in terms of J or vice versa.\n\nFrom Equation 1: M = 75 - (J/2).\n\nFrom Equation 2: J + (M/3) =75. Let me substitute M from Equation 1 into this.\n\nSo substituting M: J + [ (75 - J/2) /3 ] =75.\n\nLet me compute that. Let me expand the terms.\n\nSo,\n\nJ + (75/3) - (J/2)/3 =75.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n75/3 is 25. And (J/2)/3 is J/(6).\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nJ +25 - (J/6) =75.\n\nCombine like terms. Let's get all J terms on the left.\n\nJ - J/6 =75 -25.\n\nWhich is:\n\n(6J/6 - J/6) =50.\n\nSo (5J/6) =50.\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\n5J =300.\n\nDivide both sides by5:\n\nJ=60.\n\nWait, so John has 60 rupees? Let me check the options. Option B is 60.\n\nBut wait, I should verify this because sometimes when setting up equations, it's easy to get them mixed up.\n\nSo let's plug J=60 into equation 1 to find M.\n\nEquation1: M + (60/2) =75 \u2192 M +30=75 \u2192 M=45.\n\nSo Mark has 45, John has 60.\n\nNow check the second statement. John says if Mark gives him a third of Mark's money, John will have 75.\n\nMark's money is 45, a third is 15. So John gives 15 to Mark? Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the statement is \"if you give me one third of your money.\" So Mark is giving John one third of Mark's money. So Mark gives 45/3=15 to John.\n\nSo John's money becomes 60 +15=75. Correct. That matches.\n\nNow check Mark's first statement. If John gives half his money to Mark, which is 60/2=30. So Mark gets 30. His money would be 45+30=75. Correct.\n\nSo yes, that works. So John has 60, which is option B.\n",
