      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve. Let's read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says that there's a 90% chance a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. Now, if we pick five registered voters at random, what's the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted?\n\nHmm, right. This sounds like a binomial probability problem. I remember that the binomial distribution is used when there are a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes: success or failure. In this case, each voter either voted (success) or didn't (failure), and the trials are independent because each person's voting decision doesn't affect others.\n\nThe formula for the probability of exactly k successes in n trials is given by the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time, p is the probability of success, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n\nSo here, n is 5, k is 4, and p is 0.9.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers.\n\nFirst, calculate C(5,4). The combination formula is n!/(k!*(n-k)!)). So 5!/(4! *1!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/( (4*3*2*1)*(1) )= 120/(24 *1) = 5. So C(5,4) is 5.\n\nNext, p^k is (0.9)^4. Let me compute that. 0.9^4. 0.9 squared is 0.81, so squared again is 0.81 * 0.81. Let me compute that: 0.81 * 0.8 = 0.648, plus 0.81 * 0.01=0.0081, so total 0.6561. So (0.9)^4 is 0.6561.\n\nThen, (1-p)^(n-k) is (0.1)^(5-4) = 0.1^1 = 0.1.\n\nNow multiply all three parts: 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1.\n\nLet me compute that. 5 * 0.6561 is 3.2805, then multiply by 0.1 gives 0.32805. So approximately 0.32805, which is 32.805%.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 32.8%, which is really close.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me double-check each step.\n\nC(5,4) is definitely 5. Correct.\n\n0.9^4: 0.9 *0.9 is 0.81. 0.81 *0.9 is 0.729. 0.729 *0.9 is 0.6561. Yep, that's right.\n\n0.1^1 is 0.1. Correct.\n\nSo 5 * 0.6561 is 3.2805. Multiply by 0.1 gives 0.32805, which is 32.805%, so about 32.8% when rounded. So the correct answer should be option B.\n",

First, I need to calculate C(5,4). That's the number of ways to choose 4 successes out of 5 trials. The combination formula is C(n,k) = n!/(k!(n-k)!).\n\nCalculating C(5,4):\n5! / (4! * (5-4)!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / [ (4*3*2*1) * (1) ) ] = 120 / (24 * 1) = 5.\n\nSo C(5,4) is 5.\n\nNext, p^k is (0.9)^4. Let me compute that. 0.9^4 is 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9. Let's see: 0.9^2 is 0.81, so 0.81^2 is 0.6561. So (0.9)^4 is 0.6561.\n\nThen, (1-p)^(n-k) is (0.1)^(5-4) = 0.1^1 = 0.1.\n\nPutting it all together: P(4) = 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1.\n\nLet me compute that step by step. 5 multiplied by 0.6561 is 3.2805.

Yes. 0.1 is correct for (1-p)^(1). Multiply all together with the combination. 5 * 0.6561 is 3.2805, then times 0.1 gives 0.32805, which is 32.8%.
