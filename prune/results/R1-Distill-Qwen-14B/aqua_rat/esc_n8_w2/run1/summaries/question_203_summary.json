      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan. Mohan is 23 and Sohan is 24 now. The division is done in a way that if their shares are invested at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum, both will get equal amounts when they reach 26. I need to find out Mohan's share.\n\nHmm, let me think. So, both sons will be 26 in a few years. Let's see, Mohan is 23 now, so he'll be 26 in 3 years. Sohan is 24 now, so he'll be 26 in 2 years. \n\nThe key here is that the amount each son gets, when invested at 4% compound interest, should give them the same amount when they turn 26. So, their present shares (let's say x and y) will grow to the same amount after their respective periods.\n\nWait, so the future value of Mohan's share after 3 years should equal the future value of Sohan's share after 2 years.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is A = P*(1 + r)^t, where A is the amount, P principal, r rate, t time.\n\nSo, for Mohan: A1 = x*(1 + 0.04)^3\nFor Sohan: A2 = y*(1 + 0.04)^2\n\nAnd A1 should equal A2.\n\nSo, x*(1.04)^3 = y*(1.04)^2\n\nI can rearrange that to find the ratio of x to y.\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2: x*(1.04) = y.\n\nSo, y = x * 1.04.\n\nBut wait, the total amount is 5100. So x + y = 5100.\n\nSubstituting y from the previous equation: x + 1.04x = 5100.\n\nWhich is x*(1 + 1.04) = 5100.\n\nWait, 1 +1.04 is 2.04? No, wait, 1 + 1.04 is 2.04? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1.04 is 1 plus 0.04. So 1 + 1.04 would be 2.04? No, no, wait, that's not right. Wait, the equation is x + y = 5100, and y = 1.04x. So, x + 1.04x = 5100. That's 2.04x = 5100.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 2.04x = 5100. So x = 5100 / 2.04.\n\nLet me calculate that. 5100 divided by 2.04. Hmm, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100? Let me check: 2.04 * 2500 = (2 * 2500) + (0.04 * 2500) = 5000 + 100 = 5100. Oh, right! So x is 2500. So Mohan's share is 2500, which is option B.\n\nWait, let me double-check. So if Mohan gets 2500, then Sohan gets 2600 (because 2500 + 2600 = 5100). \n\nLet's compute their future amounts.\n\nMohan's investment: 2500 for 3 years at 4%.\nA = 2500*(1.04)^3.\n\nSohan's investment: 2600 for 2 years at 4%.\nA = 2600*(1.04)^2.\n\nLet me compute both.\n\nFirst, (1.04)^2 is 1.0816. So Sohan's amount is 2600 * 1.0816 = Let's calculate that. 2600 * 1.0816.\n\nWell, 2600 * 1 is 2600. 2600 * 0.08 = 208. 2600 * 0.0016 = 4.16. So adding up: 2600 + 208 = 2808, plus 4.16 is 2812.16.\n\nNow for Mohan's amount: (1.04)^3 is (1.04 * 1.04) * 1.04. 1.04^2 is 1.0816, multiply by 1.04 again. 1.0816 * 1.04 = let's see, 1 * 1.04 = 1.04, 0.0816*1.04 = 0.084864. So total is 1.124864. So 2500 * 1.124864 = 2500 * 1.124864.\n\n2500 * 1 is 2500. 2500 * 0.124864 is 2500 * 0.12 is 300, 2500 * 0.004864 is about 12.16. So 300 + 12.16 = 312.16. Adding to 2500 gives 2812.16.\n\nYes! Both amounts are equal at 2812.16. So the calculations check out.\n\nSo Mohan's share is 2500, which is option B.\n",

Using the compound interest formula, the future values of their shares must be equal:\n\n\\[\nx \\cdot (1.04)^3 = y \\cdot (1.04)^2\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives:\n\n\\[\ny = x \\cdot 1.04\n\\]\n\nThe total amount is:\n\n\\[\nx + y = 5100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( y = 1.04x \\):\n\n\\[\nx + 1.04x = 5100\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2.04x = 5100\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{5100}{2.04} = 2500\n\\]\n\nThus, Mohan's share is Rs. 2500.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where a father is dividing Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan. Their current ages are 23 and 24, respectively. The condition is that when their shares are invested at 4% compound interest, they'll receive equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find out how much Mohan gets.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Both sons are going to be 26, so I should figure out how many years that is from now. Mohan is 23, so that's 3 years until he's 26. Sohan is 24, so that's 2 years until he's 26. \n\nThe money each gets is going to be invested at 4% compound interest. The key here is that the future values of their investments must be equal when they reach 26. So, the amount each son receives now, when compounded for their respective years, should be the same.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. We know that M + S = 5100 because that's the total amount being divided.\n\nThe future value for Mohan's investment after 3 years would be M multiplied by (1 + 4%)^3. Similarly, Sohan's future value after 2 years is S multiplied by (1 + 4%)^2. These two future values must be equal.\n\nSo, setting up the equation: M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nWait, but since we have M + S = 5100, maybe I can express S in terms of M or vice versa. Let me try expressing S as (5100 - M).\n\nSubstituting that into the equation: M*(1.04)^3 = (5100 - M)*(1.04)^2.\n\nHmm, I can simplify this equation. Let me compute (1.04)^3 and (1.04)^2 first.\n\nCalculating (1.04)^2: 1.04 * 1.04 = 1.0816.\nAnd (1.04)^3: 1.04 * 1.0816 = let's see, 1.04 * 1.0816. Let me compute that. 1 *1.0816 is 1.0816, 0.04 *1.0816 is 0.043264. Adding them gives 1.124864. So (1.04)^3 is approximately 1.124864.\n\nSo, substituting back: M*1.124864 = (5100 - M)*1.0816.\n\nLet me expand the right side: 5100*1.0816 - M*1.0816.\n\nSo, bringing all terms to one side: M*1.124864 + M*1.0816 = 5100*1.0816.\n\nWait, no, let me rearrange the equation:\n\nM*1.124864 = 5100*1.0816 - M*1.0816.\n\nBring the M terms to the left: M*1.124864 + M*1.0816 = 5100*1.0816.\n\nFactor M out: M*(1.124864 + 1.0816) = 5100*1.0816.\n\nCompute the sum inside the parentheses: 1.124864 + 1.0816 = 2.206464.\n\nSo, M = [5100 * 1.0816] / 2.206464.\n\nWait, let me compute 5100 * 1.0816 first. 5100 * 1.0816. Let's see: 5100 * 1 is 5100, 5100 * 0.08 is 408, 5100 * 0.0016 is 8.16. So adding those: 5100 + 408 = 5508, plus 8.16 is 5516.16.\n\nSo M = 5516.16 / 2.206464.\n\nLet me compute that division. Let's see, 5516.16 divided by 2.206464.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can approximate this. Let me see:\n\n2.206464 * 2500 = ? Let's see: 2.206464 *2000 =4412.928, 2.206464 *500=1,103.232. So total 4412.928 +1103.232 =5516.16. Oh, wait! So 2.206464 *2500 equals exactly 5516.16. So M is 2500.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So M is 2500, which would make S 5100 -2500=2600.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for Mohan's share. So the answer would be 2500, which is option B.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I did that correctly. Because when I set M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2, and S=5100-M, then I arrived at M=2500. That seems to fit.\n\nBut let me check the future values. If M is 2500, then after 3 years, it's 2500*(1.04)^3 =2500 *1.124864=2812.16.\n\nAnd S is 2600, invested for 2 years: 2600*(1.04)^2=2600 *1.0816=2812.16. So yes, that matches. So both future values are the same.\n\nSo the correct share for Mohan is 2500, which is option B.\n",

Let me make sure I did that correctly. Because when I set M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2, and S=5100-M, then I arrived at M=2500. That seems to fit.\n\nBut let me check the future values. If M is 2500, then after 3 years, it's 2500*(1.04)^3 =2500 *1.124864=2812.16.\n\nAnd S is 2600, invested for 2 years: 2600*(1.04)^2=2600 *1.0816=2812.16. So yes, that matches. So both future values are the same.\n\nSo the correct share for Mohan is 2500, which is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to divide Rs. 5100 between Mohan and Sohan such that their shares, when invested at 4% compound interest, yield equal amounts when they reach the age of 26. \n\n### Key Information:\n1. **Ages and Time to 26:**\n   - Mohan is 23 years old, so he has **3 years** until he is 26.\n   - Sohan is 24 years old, so he has **2 years** until he is 26.\n\n2. **Compound Interest Formula:**\n   The future value of an investment is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Future Value} = \\text{Principal} \\times (1 + \\text{Rate})^{\\text{Time}}\n   \\]\n   For Mohan, the future value after 3 years is:\n   \\[\n   M \\times (1.04)^3\n   \\]\n   For Sohan, the future value after 2 years is:\n   \\[\n   S \\times (1.04)^2\n   \\]\n   Since the future values must be equal:\n   \\[\n   M \\times (1.04)^3 = S \\times (1.04)^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Amount Constraint:**\n   The total amount is Rs. 5100, so:\n   \\[\n   M + S = 5100\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplifying the Equation:**\n   Substitute \\( S = 5100 - M \\) into the future value equation:\n   \\[\n   M \\times (1.04)^3 = (5100 - M) \\times (1.04)^2\n   \\]\n   Calculate \\((1.04)^2 = 1.0816\\) and \\((1.04)^3 = 1.124864\\):\n   \\[\n   M \\times 1.124864 = (5100 - M) \\times 1.0816\n   \\]\n   Expand and rearrange:\n   \\[\n   M \\times 1.124864 + M \\times 1.0816 = 5100 \\times 1.0816\n   \\]\n   Factor out \\( M \\):\n   \\[\n   M \\times (1.124864 + 1.0816) = 5100 \\times 1.0816\n   \\]\n   Compute \\( 1.124864 + 1.0816 = 2.206464 \\) and \\( 5100 \\times 1.0816 = 5516.16 \\):\n   \\[\n   M = \\frac{5516.16}{2.206464} = 2500\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Mohan's share: \\( M = 2500 \\)\n   - Sohan's share: \\( S = 5100 - 2500 = 2600 \\)\n   - Future value for Mohan: \\( 2500 \\times (1.04)^3 = 2812.16 \\)\n   - Future value for Sohan: \\( 2600 \\times (1.04)^2 = 2812.16 \\)\n   Both future values are equal, confirming the solution.\n\n### Final Answer:\nMohan's share is **Rs. 2500**, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",
