      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says, when I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I'm 60, how old is my brother?\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. So, when I was 2, my brother was half my age. That means my brother was 1 year old at that time. Because half of 2 is 1.\n\nWait, so the age difference between us would be the same now as it was then, right? Because age differences don't change over time. So the difference between my age and my brother's age when I was 2 was 1 year. Because I was 2, he was 1. So the age gap is 1 year. I'm older by 1 year.\n\nSo if that's the case, then now that I'm 60, my brother should be 60 minus the age difference. Wait, no, wait. Because I'm older by 1 year, so he is younger by 1. So if I'm 60, he is 60 minus 1, which is 59. Or wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, when I was 2, he was 1. So the difference is 1 year. So now, I'm 60, he should be 60 minus 1, which is 59. So the answer would be 59, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me think about it another way. Let's say the current time is now, and I'm 60. So how old was I two years ago? Oh, wait, the first part is when I was 2, so that was 58 years ago because now I'm 60, so 60 minus 2 is 58 years ago. So 58 years ago, I was 2, and my brother was 1. So how old is he now? So 58 years have passed since then. So if he was 1, adding 58 years, he would be 59 now.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So yes, he's 59. So the answer is A) 59.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Let me denote my age as M and my brother's age as B. The age difference is M - B. When I was 2, my brother was 1. So M was 2, and B was 1. So M - B = 1. So now, M is 60, so B would be M - 1 = 59.\n\nSo yeah, definitely option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nWhen the speaker was 2 years old, their brother was half their age, meaning the brother was 1 year old at that time. The age difference between the speaker and their brother is therefore 1 year. Since age differences remain constant over time, the brother is always 1 year younger than the speaker. Now that the speaker is 60, the brother's age is 60 - 1 = 59. This can also be verified by calculating that 58 years have passed since the speaker was 2, and adding those 58 years to the brother's age at that time (1 year) results in 59. Thus, the brother is 59 years old.\n\nAnswer: A",
