      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about figuring out the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars. Hmm, I'm a bit confused at first, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe problem says that you can buy one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents. Or, alternatively, you can buy two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents. And the costs don't change. So I need to find out how much six sodas and seven bars would cost.\n\nWait, I think I remember something about systems of equations from algebra. Maybe I can set up two equations here. Let's denote the cost of one soda as 's' and the cost of one energy bar as 'b'. So the first scenario gives me the equation s + 2b = 150 cents. The second scenario gives me 2s + 3b = 300 cents.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n1. s + 2b = 150\n2. 2s + 3b = 300\n\nI need to solve for s and b. How do I do that? Oh right, I can use either substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination because the coefficients look manageable.\n\nIf I multiply the first equation by 2, I get 2s + 4b = 300. Wait, that's equation 3: 2s +4b=300. Now, subtract equation 2 from equation 3. Equation 2 is 2s +3b=300.\n\nSo subtracting equation 2 from equation 3: (2s +4b) - (2s +3b) = 300 - 300. That simplifies to 0s +b =0. So b=0? That can't be right. Because energy bars can't be free. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, let me check. Equation 3 is 2s +4b=300. Equation 2 is 2s +3b=300. Subtracting equation 2 from equation 3: (2s-2s) + (4b-3b) = 300-300. So yes, 0s +b=0, so b=0. But that doesn't make sense. Maybe I did something wrong in setting up the equations.\n\nWait, let's go back. The first scenario is one soda and two bars for 150 cents. So equation 1 is correct: s +2b=150. The second scenario is two sodas and three bars for 300 cents. So equation 2 is 2s +3b=300. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe I can solve equation 1 for s. So s=150 -2b. Then substitute that into equation 2. Let's try that.\n\nSubstituting s=150-2b into equation 2: 2*(150-2b) +3b =300. Let's calculate that.\n\n2*150 is 300, 2*(-2b) is -4b. So 300 -4b +3b =300. Combine like terms: 300 -b =300. Subtract 300 from both sides: -b=0. So b=0. Again, same result. So energy bars are free? That can't be right. Maybe I've misread the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again. It says you can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, OR two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents. Oh wait, OR\u2014so maybe those are the two options, not two separate equations. Because 300 cents for two sodas and three bars is double the price of the first option. Hmm, maybe that's a different setup.\n\nWait, the first option is 1 soda +2 bars=150. The second option is 2 sodas +3 bars=300. So is the second option exactly double the first? Let me check: 2*(1 soda +2 bars) would be 2 sodas +4 bars, which would be 300 cents. But the second option is 2 sodas +3 bars=300. So that's one bar less. So the second option is 2s +3b=300, but 2s +4b=300 as per the first option doubled. So subtracting, (2s +4b) - (2s +3b) = 300 -300 \u2192 b=0. So same result.\n\nBut if b=0, then the first equation says s +0 =150 \u2192 s=150. So each soda is 150 cents, each bar is 0. But that's strange, but mathematically consistent.\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then the cost of six sodas would be 6*150 =900 cents. And seven bars would be 7*0=0. So total is 900 cents. So the answer would be E)900.\n\nBut that seems a bit odd. The problem says \"If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost...\" So according to the given equations, that's the only solution. But perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed in such a way that the energy bars are free, but that's probably not the case in real life. But in the context of the problem, maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should check if the given options include 900. Yes, option E is 900. So according to the calculations, that's the answer. But I'm a bit puzzled because the energy bars are free. Maybe the problem is set up that way to test whether we can see that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me try solving the equations again.\n\nEquation 1: s +2b=150 \u2192 s=150-2b.\n\nEquation 2: 2s +3b=300. Substitute s from equation 1:\n\n2*(150-2b) +3b =300 \u2192 300 -4b +3b =300 \u2192 300 -b=300 \u2192 -b=0 \u2192 b=0.\n\nSo s=150-2(0)=150.\n\nSo each soda is 150 cents, each bar is 0. So 6 sodas would cost 6*150=900, 7 bars cost 0. So total is 900. So the answer is E)900.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because getting free bars doesn't make much sense. Maybe I should see if the problem is written correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says \"You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents.\" So perhaps these are two separate options, meaning that the two options are the only ones available, but that doesn't necessarily imply the equations are set as I did.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the problem is that the second option is twice the first. Let's see: first option is 150 for 1s+2b. Second is 300 for 2s+3b. Wait, 2s+3b is exactly twice 1s+2b (which would be 2s+4b=300). So the second option is 2s+3b=300, which is 300=2*(1s+2b) - b. Because 2s+4b=300, but 2s+3b=300 would imply that (2s+4b) -b=300 \u2192 300 -b=300 \u2192 b=0. So same conclusion.\n\nSo unless I'm missing something, the only solution is b=0 and s=150. So the cost of six sodas is 6*150=900, seven bars is 0. So total is 900, option E.\n\nBut wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is not an 'or' but a 'and'? No, the wording says \"or\". Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo and the second option is 2s+3b=250 or something else, but as per the given, I have to work with the numbers given.\n\nSo, despite the strange result, the calculations seem to lead to E)900.\n",

The problem gives me two options for purchases, and I think I can set up equations based on that.\n\nAlright, the first option says I can buy one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents. Let me represent the cost of one soda as S and one energy bar as E. So, the first equation would be S + 2E = 150. Got that down.\n\nThe second option is two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents. So, that translates to 2S + 3E = 300. Okay, now I have two equations:\n\n1. S + 2E = 150\n2. 2S + 3E = 300\n\nHmm, I think I can solve this system of equations to find the values of S and E. Let me try substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here.\n\nIf I multiply the first equation by 2, I'll have 2S + 4E = 300. Then I can subtract the second equation from this new equation to eliminate S. Let me write that out:\n\n2S + 4E = 300\n- (2S + 3E = 300)\n-----------------\n0S + E = 0\n\nWait, that can't be right. Subtracting 2S + 3E from 2S +4E would give (4E-3E) = E, and 300-300 is zero. So E = 0? That can't be possible because then the energy bars would be free, which doesn't make sense. Did I do that right?\n\nWait, maybe I should check my steps again. So, first equation multiplied by 2: 2S +4E=300. The second equation is 2S+3E=300. Subtracting equation 2 from the multiplied equation:\n\n(2S -2S) + (4E -3E) = 300 -300 \u2192 0S + E = 0. So E=0. Hmm, that's strange. But if E is zero, then looking back at the first equation, S + 2*0 = 150 \u2192 S=150. So each soda is 150 cents, each bar is zero. But that can't be right because in the second option, two sodas and three bars would be 2*150 +3*0=300, which matches the given data. But in reality, it's impossible for the bars to be free. Did I make a mistake in setting up the equations?\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in how I set up the equations. Let me double-check the problem. Oh wait, the first option says one soda and two bars for 150 cents. The second is two sodas and three bars for 300. So the equations are correct. So according to this, E=0. That would mean each bar is free, and each soda is 150 cents. But that seems unrealistic, but mathematically, that's what the equations are showing.\n\nBut wait, let's think again. If E=0, then the second option is two sodas and three bars for 300. So 2*150 +3*0=300, which works. So the math checks out, but maybe the problem is designed this way.\n\nNow, the question is to find the cost of six sodas and seven bars. So, 6S +7E. Since E=0, that's 6S +0=6S. And since S=150, 6*150=900. So the total would be 900 cents.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 900. So the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, that seems like a lot. Let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe I should try substitution instead of elimination.\n\nFrom the first equation, S = 150 - 2E. Plug that into the second equation: 2*(150-2E) +3E =300. Let's compute that.\n\n2*150 is 300, 2*(-2E) is -4E. So 300 -4E +3E =300 \u2192 300 -E =300. Subtract 300 from both sides: -E=0 \u2192 E=0. So same result as before.\n\nSo S=150-2*0=150. So each soda is 150 cents. So for six sodas: 6 *150=900. Seven bars would be 7*0=0. So total is 900. So the answer is E)900.\n\nBut wait, the options have E as 900. So that's the correct answer. But I'm a bit confused because having free bars seems odd, but the problem states the costs don't change, so perhaps that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check the problem again.\n\nProblem says: one soda and two bars for 150, two sodas and three bars for 300. So the equations are correct. So I think the answer is E.\n",

Subtracting 2S + 3E from 2S +4E would give (4E-3E) = E, and 300-300 is zero. So E = 0? That can't be possible because then the energy bars would be free, which doesn't make sense. Did I do that right?\n\nWait, maybe I should check my steps again. So, first equation multiplied by 2: 2S +4E=300. The second equation is 2S+3E=300. Subtracting equation 2 from the multiplied equation:\n\n(2S -2S) + (4E -3E) = 300 -300 \u2192 0S + E = 0. So E=0. Hmm, that's strange. But if E is zero, then looking back at the first equation, S + 2*0 = 150 \u2192 S=150. So each soda is 150 cents, each bar is zero. But that can't be right because in the second option, two sodas and three bars would be 2*150 +3*0=300, which matches the given data. But in reality, it's impossible for the bars to be free. Did I make a mistake in setting up the equations?\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in how I set up the equations. Let me double-check the problem. Oh wait, the first option says one soda and two bars for 150 cents. The second is two sodas and three bars for 300. So the equations are correct. So according to this, E=0. That would mean each bar is free, and each soda is 150 cents. But that seems unrealistic, but mathematically, that's what the equations are showing.\n\nBut wait, let's think again. If E=0, then the second option is two sodas and three bars for 300. So 2*150 +3*0=300, which works. So the math checks out, but maybe the problem is designed this way.\n\nNow, the question is to find the cost of six sodas and seven bars. So, 6S +7E. Since E=0, that's 6S +0=6S. And since S=150, 6*150=900. So the total would be 900 cents.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 900. So the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, that seems like a lot. Let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe I should try substitution instead of elimination.\n\nFrom the first equation, S = 150 - 2E. Plug that into the second equation: 2*(150-2E) +3E =300. Let's compute that.\n\n2*150 is 300, 2*(-2E) is -4E. So 300 -4E +3E =300 \u2192 300 -E =300. Subtract 300 from both sides: -E=0 \u2192 E=0. So same result as before.\n\nSo S=150-2*0=150. So each soda is 150 cents. So for six sodas: 6 *150=900. Seven bars would be 7*0=0. So total is 900. So the answer is E)900.\n\nBut wait, the options have E as 900. So that's the correct answer. But I'm a bit confused because having free bars seems odd, but the problem states the costs don't change, so perhaps that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check the problem again.\n\nProblem says: one soda and two bars for 150, two sodas and three bars for 300. So the equations are correct. So I think the answer is E.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by defining the cost of one soda as \\( S \\) cents and one energy bar as \\( E \\) cents. The problem provides two equations based on the given purchase options:\n\n1. \\( S + 2E = 150 \\) (one soda and two energy bars cost 150 cents),\n2. \\( 2S + 3E = 300 \\) (two sodas and three energy bars cost 300 cents).\n\nTo solve this system of equations, we use the elimination method. First, multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of \\( S \\) equal:\n\n\\[\n2S + 4E = 300\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract the second equation \\( 2S + 3E = 300 \\) from this result:\n\n\\[\n(2S + 4E) - (2S + 3E) = 300 - 300\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nE = 0\n\\]\n\nThis means each energy bar costs 0 cents. Substituting \\( E = 0 \\) back into the first equation:\n\n\\[\nS + 2(0) = 150 \\implies S = 150\n\\]\n\nThus, each soda costs 150 cents.\n\nThe problem asks for the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars. Using the values of \\( S \\) and \\( E \\):\n\n\\[\n6S + 7E = 6(150) + 7(0) = 900 + 0 = 900\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost is 900 cents. Among the given options, the correct answer is:\n\n**E) 900**\n\nAnswer: E",
