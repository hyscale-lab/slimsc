      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the percentage gain of a merchant who bought oranges and sold them. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, the merchant bought 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450. So, first, I should find out the cost price per kilogram. To do that, I can divide the total cost by the total quantity. So, 450 divided by 90. Let me calculate that. 450 \u00f7 90 is 5. So, the cost per kg is Rs. 5.\n\nNext, the merchant sold the whole lot at Rs. 7.50 per kg. So, the selling price per kg is 7.50. I need to find out the profit per kg. To do that, I subtract the cost price from the selling price. So, 7.50 minus 5 equals 2.50. That means he makes a profit of Rs. 2.50 per kg.\n\nNow, to find the total profit, I multiply the profit per kg by the total number of kg. That's 2.50 multiplied by 90. Let me compute that. 2.5 * 90 is 225. So, the total profit is Rs. 225.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the total selling price first. Let's see, selling price per kg is 7.50, and he sold 90 kg. So, total SP is 7.50 * 90. Let me do that: 7.5 times 90. Hmm, 7 *90 is 630, and 0.5*90 is 45. So total is 675. Then, the cost price was 450, so the profit is 675 minus 450, which is 225. So same as before.\n\nNow, percentage gain is calculated based on the cost price, I think. So, the formula is (Profit / Cost Price) * 100. So, Profit is 225, cost is 450. So 225 divided by 450 equals 0.5. Multiply by 100 gives 50%. So the percentage gain is 50%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 50%. So the correct answer should be A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo calculate the percentage gain, we first determine the cost price per kg of oranges, which is Rs. 450 \u00f7 90 = Rs. 5 per kg. The selling price per kg is Rs. 7.50, so the profit per kg is Rs. 7.50 - Rs. 5 = Rs. 2.50. \n\nThe total profit for 90 kg is Rs. 2.50 \u00d7 90 = Rs. 225. The total cost price is Rs. 450. The percentage gain is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Gain} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Profit}}{\\text{Cost Price}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{225}{450} \\right) \\times 100 = 50\\%.\n\\]\n\nThus, the percentage gain is **50%**.\n\nAnswer: A",
