      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question here about renting DVDs and whether it's worth getting a membership. Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out the minimum number of DVDs someone would have to rent for the membership deal to be better than paying without a membership. \n\nAlright, let's break down the costs. Without a membership, each DVD costs $4.00. If you buy a membership for $7.00 a month, each DVD only costs $2.00 each. So the question is, how many DVDs do you need to rent so that the total cost with the membership is less than renting without it.\n\nLet me think about the math. Let's say you rent 'x' number of DVDs. Without the membership, the total cost is 4x dollars. With the membership, you pay a flat fee of $7 plus 2x dollars for the DVDs. So the total cost in that case is 7 + 2x.\n\nWe want to find the smallest x where 7 + 2x is less than 4x. Because that's when the membership becomes more economical.\n\nSo setting up the inequality: 7 + 2x < 4x.\n\nHmm, let's solve for x. Subtract 2x from both sides. That gives 7 < 2x. Then divide both sides by 2. So x > 3.5. \n\nWait, so x has to be greater than 3.5. But you can't rent half a DVD, right? So you round up to the next whole number. That makes x at least 4.\n\nSo the minimum number of DVDs is 4. Let me double-check that. \n\nIf you rent 4 DVDs without membership, it's 4*4 = $16. With membership, it's $7 + (4*2) = $7 + $8 = $15. Oh, wait, that's cheaper. So at 4, it's better to get the membership.\n\nWait, what about 3? Without membership, 3*4 = $12. With membership, 7 + 6 = $13. So 13 is more than 12. So 3 isn't enough. Hence, 4 is the minimum.\n",

I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nSo the question is asking for the minimum number of DVDs I need to rent so that buying the membership is cheaper or better than paying without it. Right. Without a membership, each DVD costs $4.00. But if I get a membership for $7.00 a month, each rental only costs $2.00. I need to find out when the total cost with the membership is less than or equal to the cost without.\n\nWait, so let me set this up. Let's say I rent 'x' number of DVDs. Without the membership, the cost is 4 times x, right? So that's 4x dollars.\n\nWith the membership, I have to pay the $7 for the membership plus $2 per DVD. So that would be 7 + 2x dollars.\n\nI need to find the smallest x where 7 + 2x is less than or equal to 4x. Because that's when the membership becomes a better deal.\n\nSo, setting up the inequality: 7 + 2x \u2264 4x.\n\nLet me solve this. Subtract 2x from both sides: 7 \u2264 2x. Then, divide both sides by 2: 7/2 \u2264 x. 7 divided by 2 is 3.5. So x has to be greater than or equal to 3.5.\n\nBut wait, you can't rent half a DVD, right? So x has to be at least 4? Or maybe 3.5 rounds up to 4? Because 3.5 is halfway between 3 and 4. So to make sure the total cost is less or equal, you need to rent 4 DVDs.\n\nWait, let me check that. Let's plug in x=3 into both options.\n\nWithout membership: 3 *4 = $12.\n\nWith membership: 7 + 3*2 = 7 +6= $13. Oh, so with 3, it's actually more expensive. So 3 isn't enough.\n\nWhat about x=4?\n\nWithout: 4*4=16.\n\nWith:7 +4*2=7+8=15. So 15 is less than 16. So at 4, it's cheaper to have the membership.\n\nSo the minimum number is 4, which is option D.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The question says \"minimum amount of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership.\" So when the total cost with the membership is less than without.\n\nSo when x is 4, the cost is $15 vs $16 without. So yes, that's when it's worth it.\n\nWait, but let me also check x=3.5. So 3.5 *4 is 14. The membership cost at 3.5 would be 7 + (3.5 *2) =7+7=14. So at exactly 3.5, both are equal. But since you can't rent half a DVD, you'd have to rent 4 to get the lower cost.\n\nSo the answer is D)4.\n",
