      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a shopkeeper and his servant. Hmm, let's see. The question is about figuring out how much sale the servant needs to make so that his monthly income is 6000 rupees. \n\nAlright, let me break it down. The servant has a monthly salary of 1500 rupees. Plus, he gets a 15% commission on the monthly sales. So, his total income is the sum of his fixed salary and the commission from sales.\n\nWait, the goal is for his total income to be 6000. So, I need to find the sale amount that when 15% of it is added to 1500, it equals 6000.\n\nLet me write this as an equation. Let's say the sale amount is S. Then, the commission is 15% of S, which is 0.15 * S. His total income is 1500 + 0.15S. And we want this to be 6000.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n1500 + 0.15S = 6000.\n\nNow, I need to solve for S. Subtract 1500 from both sides.\n\n0.15S = 6000 - 1500.\n0.15S = 4500.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.15 to get S.\n\nS = 4500 / 0.15.\n\nWait, what's 4500 divided by 0.15? Hmm, let me calculate. 0.15 is the same as 15/100, so dividing by 0.15 is the same as multiplying by 100/15. So, 4500 * (100/15) = ?\n\nWait, 4500 divided by 15 is 300. Then 300 multiplied by 100 is 30,000. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 4500 divided by 0.15 is the same as 4500 * (100/15). Let me compute that.\n\nWait, 4500 divided by 15 is 300. Because 15*300=4500. So, 300 * 100 is 30,000. So, S is 30,000 rupees.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 30,000. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If the sale is 30,000, the commission is 15% of that, which is 4500. Adding the salary: 1500 + 4500 = 6000. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be A) 30000.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the required sale amount for the servant's monthly income to be 6000 rupees, we start by noting his fixed salary of 1500 rupees and a 15% commission on sales. Let the sale amount be \\( S \\). The total income is given by:\n\n\\[\n1500 + 0.15S = 6000\n\\]\n\nSubtract 1500 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0.15S = 4500\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 0.15:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{4500}{0.15} = 30000\n\\]\n\nThus, the servant needs to make a sale of 30,000 rupees. Verifying, a 15% commission on 30,000 is 4500, and adding the fixed salary gives \\( 1500 + 4500 = 6000 \\), which matches the target income. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: A",

The question is asking what sale amount is needed for that to happen. The options are given, but I'll try to figure it out without looking at them yet.\n\nHmm, let's see. The servant's total income is the sum of his fixed salary and the commission from sales. The commission is 15% of the sales. So, the equation should be something like:\n\nTotal Income = Salary + Commission\n\nWe know the total income desired is 6000, and the salary is 1500. So substituting those in:\n\n6000 = 1500 + (15% of Sales)\n\nWait, so the commission part is 15% of the sales. Let me represent sales as S. So the equation becomes:\n\n6000 = 1500 + 0.15 * S\n\nI need to solve for S. Let me rearrange this equation.\n\nFirst, subtract 1500 from both sides to isolate the commission part:\n\n6000 - 1500 = 0.15 * S\n\nThat's 4500 equals 0.15 times S. Now, to find S, I can divide both sides by 0.15.\n\nSo S = 4500 / 0.15\n\nLet me calculate that. 4500 divided by 0.15. Hmm, 0.15 is the same as 3/20, so dividing by 3/20 is the same as multiplying by 20/3.\n\nWait, 4500 * (20/3) = ?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 4500 \u00f7 0.15. Let me think. 0.15 times 30,000 is 4500 because 0.15 * 30,000 = 4500. Wait, no, wait. 0.15 times 30,000 would be 4500? Let me check: 15% of 30,000 is 4500. Yes, because 10% is 3000, 5% is 1500, so 3000+1500=4500. So S is 30,000? Wait, no, because 0.15 * 30,000 is 4500, right. But in our equation, 0.15 * S = 4500. So S is 30,000. So the sales should be 30,000 rupees.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If sales are 30,000, then 15% is 4500. Adding the 1500 salary, total is 6000. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 30,000. Option C is 31,500. Hmm, wait, no. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because 1500 plus 4500 is 6000, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the options. Let me look again. The options are:\n\nA)30000\n\nB)415000\n\nC)31500\n\nD)50000\n\nE)None of these\n\nWait, so A is 30,000, which matches what I calculated. So the correct answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, another approach: maybe the commission is on the sale after some deductions? Or is it 15% of the total sale? The question says commission is 15% on monthly sale, so that's straightforward. So the calculation seems right.\n\nSo, the answer should be option A, 30000.\n",
