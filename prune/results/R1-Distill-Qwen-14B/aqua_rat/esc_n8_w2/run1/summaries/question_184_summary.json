      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again. The question is: \"A number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. Find the number.\" Hmm, I need to find a number that is equally distant from 36 and 86. Wait, wait, no, not exactly equally distant, but the amount by which it's greater than 36 is the same as the amount it's less than 86. Oh right, so the difference between the number and 36 is the same as the difference between 86 and the number.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's say the number is x. So, x is greater than 36 by some amount, and less than 86 by the same amount. So, the way I can write this is as an equation: x - 36 = 86 - x. Because the amount it's greater than 36 (which is x-36) equals the amount it's less than 86 (which is 86-x).\n\nSo the equation is x - 36 = 86 - x. Now I can solve for x. Let me add x to both sides to get rid of the negative x on the right. So adding x to both sides gives me 2x -36 =86. Then I can add 36 to both sides to isolate the terms with x. So 2x = 86 +36. 86 plus 36 is... 122? Wait, 86 plus 30 is 116, and plus 6 is 122. So 2x =122. Then divide both sides by 2: x=61. Oh, wait, 122 divided by 2 is 61.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If x is 61, then how much greater is it than 36? 61-36 is 25. And how much less is it than 86? 86-61 is 25. Oh yeah, that works. So 61 is the number. Looking at the options, option D is 61. So the answer should be D.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this as the number being exactly halfway between 36 and 86. Because the distance from 36 to x is the same as from x to 86. So the midpoint between 36 and 86 would be (36 +86)/2. Let's calculate that. 36 plus 86 is 122. Divided by 2 is 61. Yep, same answer. So definitely, the number is 61.\n",
