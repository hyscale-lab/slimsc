      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with combinatorics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.\n\nA man wants to eat fruit for breakfast and vegetable for dinner. He has 6 different types of fruit and 8 different types of vegetables. He can only eat one type at a time. In how many ways can he eat breakfast and dinner.\n\nHmm, so the man is choosing one fruit for breakfast and one vegetable for dinner. I think the key here is to figure out how many choices he has for each meal and then multiply them together because each choice is independent.\n\nWait, so for breakfast, he has 6 types of fruits to choose from. That means 6 possible options for his breakfast. Then for dinner, he has 8 different vegetables. So for dinner, he has 8 options.\n\nSince these are separate choices (fruit and vegetable), the total number of combinations should be the product of the two. So that would be 6 multiplied by 8.\n\nLet me calculate that: 6 * 8 is 48. So that's 48 possible ways he can have his breakfast and dinner.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 48. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Could there be any other factors I'm missing? Like, maybe the order of eating? But the question says breakfast and dinner, so the order is fixed. He can't have dinner first and then breakfast. So I don't think order matters here beyond the fact that they're separate meals.\n\nAlso, the problem states he can only eat one type at a time, but since he's choosing one fruit and one vegetable, each being a single type, that condition is already satisfied.\n\nSo yeah, I'm pretty confident the answer is 48, which is option C.\n",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is about a man who wants to eat fruit for breakfast and vegetables for dinner. He has 6 different types of fruit and 8 different types of vegetables. The question is asking in how many ways he can eat breakfast and dinner. The options are A)54, B)24, C)48, D)20, E)36.\n\nHmm, so I think this is a combinatorics problem, specifically about permutations or combinations. Since the man is choosing one fruit and one vegetable, it's probably about the number of possible combinations.\n\nWait, so for breakfast, he picks a fruit, and for dinner, he picks a vegetable. Each choice is independent of the other because what he chooses for breakfast doesn't affect what he can choose for dinner. So I think I should calculate the number of choices he has for each meal and then multiply them together.\n\nRight, so the number of ways to choose breakfast is equal to the number of fruits he has, which is 6. Similarly, the number of ways to choose dinner is the number of vegetables, which is 8.\n\nSo the total number of possible combinations is 6 multiplied by 8. Let me do that: 6 * 8 = 48. That gives me 48 possible ways.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 48, so that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Are there any other factors? The problem says he can only eat one type at a time, which I think just reinforces that he's choosing one fruit and one vegetable. So no, there's no repetition or anything else to consider here.\n\nYeah, I'm pretty confident. It's a straightforward multiplication principle problem.\n",
