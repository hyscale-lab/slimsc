      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about the ratio of the volumes of a cube and a sphere that fits inside it. Hmm, I need to find the ratio of the cube's volume to the sphere's volume. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a sphere fits perfectly inside a cube, the sphere touches the cube exactly at the centers of each face of the cube. That means the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube. Oh right, because the sphere can't extend beyond the cube, so the sphere's diameter can't be larger than the cube's edge.\n\nSo, let me denote the edge length of the cube as 'a'. Then the diameter of the sphere is 'a', which makes the radius of the sphere 'a/2'.\n\nNow, the volume of the cube is straightforward. It's just the edge length cubed, so V_cube = a\u00b3.\n\nNext, the volume of the sphere. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. Since the radius r is a/2, plugging that in gives V_sphere = (4/3)\u03c0(a/2)\u00b3.\n\nLet me compute that. (a/2) cubed is a\u00b3/(2\u00b3) = a\u00b3/8. Multiply that by 4/3\u03c0: (4/3)*(\u03c0)*(a\u00b3/8) = (4\u03c0 a\u00b3)/(24). Simplifying 4/24 gives 1/6, so V_sphere = (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. (a/2)^3 is a\u00b3/8. Then 4/3 * (a\u00b3/8) = (4 a\u00b3)/(24) = a\u00b3/6. Oh yeah, so multiplied by \u03c0 gives (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6. Got it.\n\nNow, I need the ratio of the cube's volume to the sphere's volume. So V_cube / V_sphere = (a\u00b3) / ( (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6 ). \n\nThe a\u00b3 terms cancel out, which is good because the ratio shouldn't depend on the actual size. So that leaves 1 / (\u03c0/6) = 6/\u03c0.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, I don't see 6:\u03c0 as an option. Let me check the options again. Oh wait, option D is 6:\u03c0. So that's probably the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nCube volume is a\u00b3. Sphere radius is a/2. Sphere volume is (4/3)\u03c0(r)^3 = (4/3)\u03c0(a/2)^3 = (4/3)\u03c0 (a\u00b3/8) = (4\u03c0 a\u00b3)/(24) = \u03c0 a\u00b3 /6. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo cube volume over sphere is a\u00b3/(\u03c0 a\u00b3/6) = 6/\u03c0. So the ratio is 6 : \u03c0.\n\nLooking at the options, option D says 6:\u03c0. So the answer should be D.\n",

Yes, that's (4/3) * \u03c0 * a\u00b3/8. 4 divided by 8 is 0.5, so 0.5 * (1/3) is 1/6. So yes, (1/6)\u03c0 a\u00b3. So the cube is a\u00b3, sphere is (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6.
