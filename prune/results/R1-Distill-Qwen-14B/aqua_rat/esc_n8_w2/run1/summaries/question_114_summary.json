      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to rotational motion, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: A point on the edge of a fan blade is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center. What is the distance traveled by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute?\n\nHmm, right. So the key here is to find the total distance the point travels in 30 seconds. I remember that in circular motion, the distance traveled depends on the circumference of the path and the number of revolutions.\n\nLet me jot down the given data:\n\n- Radius (r) = 10 cm. Because the point is on the edge, so the distance from the center is the radius.\n- Time (t) = 30 seconds.\n- Revolutions per minute (RPM) = 300.\n\nWait, but the time is in seconds and the rate is in minutes. I should probably convert the RPM to revolutions per second to make things consistent. Or, alternatively, calculate the total number of revolutions in 30 seconds.\n\nRight, so 300 revolutions per minute. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so per second, it's 300/60 = 5 revolutions per second. Hmm, no, wait, that's not right. Wait, 300 RPM means in 60 seconds, it makes 300 revolutions. So in 30 seconds, it would make half that, which is 150 revolutions. Oh, wait, no, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 300 revolutions per minute is 300 revs in 60 seconds. So per second, it's 300 / 60 = 5 revolutions per second. So in 30 seconds, it would be 5 revs/sec * 30 sec = 150 revolutions total. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nNow, each revolution means the point travels the circumference of the circle once. The circumference (C) is 2 * \u03c0 * r. So with r =10 cm, C = 2 * \u03c0 * 10 = 20\u03c0 cm.\n\nSo for each revolution, the distance is 20\u03c0 cm. Then, for 150 revolutions, the total distance (D) would be 150 * 20\u03c0.\n\nLet me compute that: 150 * 20 is 3000. So 3000\u03c0 cm.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option D is 3000pi. So that's probably the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in unit conversions.\n\nAnother way to approach it: Calculate the angular velocity, then find the total angle, then find the arc length.\n\nAngular velocity (\u03c9) in radians per second. Since one revolution is 2\u03c0 radians, 300 RPM is 300 * 2\u03c0 radians per minute. So that's 600\u03c0 rad/min. To convert to per second, divide by 60: 600\u03c0 /60 = 10\u03c0 rad/s.\n\nTime is 30 seconds. So total angle (\u03b8) is \u03c9 * t = 10\u03c0 *30 = 300\u03c0 radians.\n\nArc length (s) is r\u03b8. Here, r is 10 cm. So s =10 * 300\u03c0 = 3000\u03c0 cm. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the answer must be D) 3000pi.\n",

Hmm, the question says that a point on the edge of a fan blade is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center. I need to find the distance it travels after 30 seconds when the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute.\n\nWait, right, so the point is on the edge, so the radius is 10 cm. That makes sense. The fan's speed is given in revolutions per minute (RPM), and I need to convert that into something that works with seconds. Oh right, because the time given is 30 seconds, not minutes.\n\nSo first, let me think about the RPM. 300 revolutions per minute. One minute is 60 seconds, so each second, the fan does 300/60 = 5 revolutions per second. Okay, so 5 revs every second.\n\nEach revolution is a full circle, which is 2\u03c0 radians. So each revolution, the point moves a distance equal to the circumference of the circle. The circumference is 2\u03c0r, right? Since the radius is 10 cm, the circumference is 2 * \u03c0 * 10 cm = 20\u03c0 cm. So each revolution, the point travels 20\u03c0 cm.\n\nNow, since the fan is running for 30 seconds, and it does 5 revolutions each second, the total number of revolutions in 30 seconds is 5 * 30 = 150 revolutions. \n\nWait, no, wait a second. Let me double-check that. 300 RPM is 300 revolutions in 60 seconds, so per second it's 5 revs. Multiply by 30 seconds: 5 *30 is 150 revs. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo the total distance is the number of revolutions multiplied by the circumference. So 150 revs * 20\u03c0 cm per rev. Let me calculate that: 150 *20 is 3000, so 3000\u03c0 cm. Wait, but looking at the options, D is 3000\u03c0. So that would be the answer, right?\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Oh, wait, the question says the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute, which is 5 per second, right. So 30 seconds gives 150 revs. Each rev is 20\u03c0 cm. So 150 * 20\u03c0 = 3000\u03c0 cm. So yes, the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me look at the options again. Option D is 3000\u03c0. So that's correct. I think I did that correctly. No mistakes in the calculations. So yeah, the answer should be D.\n",
