      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Alice is trying to fence her yard, but she's leaving one side unfenced. Hmm, the yard is rectangular, which is good because that makes the problem a bit easier. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nSo, the problem says she's putting fencing around three sides, leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. Wait, so the unfenced side is 10 meters. But which side is that? Is it the length or the width? Because in a rectangle, there are two lengths and two widths. So, if she's leaving one side of 10m unfenced, that could mean either the length or the width is 10m. Hmm, I need to figure out which one it is.\n\nBut wait, maybe the 10 meters is one of the sides that's being left without fencing. So if the yard is a rectangle, let's imagine it as having two lengths and two widths. Suppose the unfenced side is one of the lengths. Then the other length and both widths would be fenced. Alternatively, if the unfenced side is one of the widths, then both lengths and the other width are fenced.\n\nThe area is given as 240 square meters. The area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width. So, I think I can model this with variables. Let me assign variables to the sides.\n\nLet's say the length is L and the width is W. The problem states that one of these is 10 meters, but which one? Wait, the problem says she's leaving a side of 10 meters unfenced. So that side could be either L or W. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: The unfenced side is the length (L) = 10 meters. Then, the area is L * W = 10 * W = 240. So W would be 240 / 10 = 24 meters. \n\nIn this case, the fencing required would be for the other length and both widths. So fencing needed is L + 2W. Substituting, that's 10 + 2*(24) = 10 + 48 = 58 meters. Hmm, that's one of the options, option A is 58.\n\nCase 2: The unfenced side is the width (W) = 10 meters. Then, the area would be L * 10 = 240, so L = 240 /10 =24 meters.\n\nIn this scenario, the fencing needed would be for both lengths and the other width. So that's 2*L + W. Substituting, 2*24 +10=48 +10=58 meters. Wait, that's the same as before. So regardless of whether the unfenced side is length or width, the fencing comes out to 58 meters?\n\nWait, that's interesting. Because in both cases, the total fencing is the same. So that's why the answer is 58 meters, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nIn case 1: L=10, W=24. Fencing is L + 2W =10 +48=58.\n\nIn case 2: W=10, L=24. Fencing is 2L + W=48+10=58.\n\nYes, same result. So the answer should be 58 meters, which is option A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Alice putting up fencing around her yard. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I'll take it slow.\n\nSo, the problem says Alice is fencing three sides of her rectangular yard and leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. The area of the yard is 240 square meters. I need to find out how many meters of fencing she needs.\n\nHmm, let's visualize this. A rectangle has four sides. If she's leaving one side unfenced, then the fencing is along the other three sides. But wait, which side is she leaving unfenced? Is it one of the lengths or one of the widths? That's important because the lengths and widths might be different.\n\nWait, the problem says it's a rectangular yard, so opposite sides are equal. Let me denote the sides. Let's say the yard has a length 'L' and a width 'W'. Now, if one of the sides is 10 meters and it's unfenced, I need to figure out whether that's a length or a width.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the 10-meter side is the length or the width. Hmm, maybe I should consider both possibilities, but perhaps the way the problem is worded can help. Oh, wait, the problem says she's fencing three sides and leaving one side of 10m. So, maybe the 10m is one of the sides she's leaving unfenced.\n\nSo, let's think about the layout. If the yard is rectangular, and she's fencing three sides, perhaps two widths and one length, or two lengths and one width. Wait, that depends on which side is left unfenced.\n\nWait, let me draw it out mentally. Suppose the yard is longer in one direction. If she's leaving the length (the longer side) unfenced, then she's fencing both widths and one length. Alternatively, if she's leaving a width unfenced, she's fencing the two lengths and one width.\n\nBut without knowing which is which, maybe we can assign variables and see.\n\nLet me define the sides. Let's say the sides are L and W. So, area is L * W = 240.\n\nNow, the fencing is for three sides. Let's assume that the side left unfenced is one of the lengths. So, she's fencing two widths and one length. So the total fencing needed would be 2W + L.\n\nAlternatively, if the side left unfenced is a width, then fencing is 2L + W.\n\nWait, but the problem says one side is 10 meters, which is unfenced. So that side is either L or W. So, if the 10m is the length, then the fencing would be 2W + L. If it's the width, then fencing is 2L + W.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the unfenced side is 10 meters. So, either L =10 or W=10.\n\nSo, two cases:\n\nCase 1: L =10 m (unfenced). Then fencing is 2W + L = 2W +10.\n\nCase 2: W=10 m (unfenced). Then fencing is 2L + W = 2L +10.\n\nWe also know that the area is L * W = 240.\n\nSo, let's explore both cases.\n\nCase 1: L=10. Then, area is 10 * W =240 \u2192 W=240/10=24 m.\n\nSo, fencing would be 2W + L = 2*24 +10 =48+10=58 m.\n\nCase 2: W=10. Then, area is L *10 =240 \u2192 L=24 m.\n\nFencing is 2L + W =2*24 +10=48+10=58 m.\n\nWait, both cases give the same fencing length of 58 meters? That's interesting. So regardless of whether the 10m is the length or the width, the fencing needed is 58 meters.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have 58 as the correct answer? Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are A)58, B)62, C)66, D)70, E)74.\n\nOh wait, option A is 58. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because sometimes I might mix up the sides.\n\nIn case 1: L=10, so the fencing is 2W + L. W is 24, so 2*24=48 +10=58.\n\nCase2: W=10, so L is 24. Fencing is 2L + W \u2192 2*24=48 +10=58. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the answer should be 58 meters, which is option A.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe the 10m is the length she's leaving unfenced, so the fencing is two widths and one length. But if the length is 10, then the area is 240, so W is 24. So fencing is 2*24 +10=58.\n\nAlternatively, if the width is 10, the length is 24, fencing is 2*24 +10=58. Either way, same.\n\nHmm, seems correct. So the answer is A)58.\n",
