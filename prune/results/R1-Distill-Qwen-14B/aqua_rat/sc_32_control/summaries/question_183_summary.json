      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this algebra problem here, and I need to figure out what replaces the question mark. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe equation given is a\u00b2 minus (b\u00b2 divided by (a + b) squared) equals something, and that something is supposed to be equal to (a - b) squared. Hmm, wait, maybe I should write it out more clearly to understand.\n\nSo it's: a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2 (?) = (a - b)\u00b2. Oh wait, I'm a bit confused now. Wait, actually, looking at the equation again, perhaps the structure is a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2] equals (a - b)\u00b2 multiplied by something (the question mark). Or maybe the question mark is a fraction that when multiplied gives (a - b)\u00b2. Wait, the way it's written is a bit ambiguous. Let me parse the equation correctly.\n\nWait, the equation is written as a\u00b2 - b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2 (?) = (a - b)\u00b2. So probably, the question mark is a term that when multiplied by (a + b)\u00b2 gives (a - b)\u00b2. Wait, perhaps the equation is a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2] equals (something) multiplied by (a - b)\u00b2. Or maybe the question mark is in the denominator or numerator. Hmm, perhaps the structure is a\u00b2 minus (b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2 equals (something) times (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe the question is written as a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2] = ? * (a - b)\u00b2, and we need to find the ? term. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2] * (?) equals (a - b)\u00b2. Hmm, perhaps I should look at the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: What should come in place of the question mark (?) in each of the following questions? The equation given is a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2 (?) = (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2] * (?) equals (a - b)\u00b2. So the question is to find the value of the question mark. That would make sense.\n\nSo the equation is a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2) * (?) = (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the question mark. Let me write it down step by step.\n\nLet me denote the question mark as X for clarity.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\na\u00b2 - (b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2) * X = (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for X.\n\nFirst, subtract a\u00b2 from both sides:\n- (b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2) * X = (a - b)\u00b2 - a\u00b2.\n\nCompute the right side: (a - b)\u00b2 is a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2. So subtracting a\u00b2 gives:\n\n(a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2) - a\u00b2 = -2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nSo now, the equation is:\n- (b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2) * X = b\u00b2 - 2ab.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n(b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2) * X = 2ab - b\u00b2.\n\nFactor the right side: 2ab - b\u00b2 = b(2a - b). Hmm, but perhaps we can factor it differently. Alternatively, let's factor b\u00b2 in the denominator.\n\nWait, perhaps I should express both sides in terms of factoring. Let's see.\n\nSo, (b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2) * X = b\u00b2 ( (2a - b)/b )? Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Let me instead solve for X.\n\nX = [ (2ab - b\u00b2) * (a + b)\u00b2 ] / b\u00b2.\n\nSimplify numerator: 2ab - b\u00b2 = b(2a - b).\n\nSo X = [ b(2a - b) * (a + b)\u00b2 ] / b\u00b2.\n\nThe b in the numerator cancels with one b in the denominator, leaving:\n\nX = (2a - b) * (a + b)\u00b2 / b.\n\nWait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me see if I can factor further or simplify.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rearrangement. Let me go back and check.\n\nThe original equation is a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2 X )/(a + b)^2 = (a - b)^2.\n\nLet me rearrange this correctly. Subtract a\u00b2 on both sides:\n\n- (b\u00b2 X)/(a + b)^2 = (a - b)^2 - a\u00b2.\n\nCompute (a - b)^2 - a\u00b2:\n\n(a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2) - a\u00b2 = -2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n- (b\u00b2 X)/(a + b)^2 = -2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n(b\u00b2 X)/(a + b)^2 = 2ab - b\u00b2.\n\nFactor right side: 2ab - b\u00b2 = b(2a - b).\n\nSo,\n\nX = [ (2ab - b\u00b2) * (a + b)^2 ] / b\u00b2.\n\nFactor numerator: 2ab - b\u00b2 = b(2a - b).\n\nSo,\n\nX = [ b(2a - b) * (a + b)^2 ] / b\u00b2.\n\nThe b in numerator cancels with one b in denominator: X = (2a - b) (a + b)^2 / b.\n\nNow, wait, none of the options seem to match this. The options are A to E, with E being none of these.\n\nWait, looking back at the options:\n\nA) (a + b)(a - b)\nB) (a - b)^2\nC) (a + b)^2\nD) a^3 + b^3\nE) None of these.\n\nHmm, none of these options match the expression I got, which is (2a - b)(a + b)^2 / b. So the correct answer would be E) None of these.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the original equation. Maybe the equation is a\u00b2 minus (b\u00b2/(a + b)^2) equals (a - b)^2 multiplied by the question mark. So, a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] = (a - b)^2 * X.\n\nIf that's the case, let's solve for X.\n\nSo:\n\nX = [a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ] / (a - b)^2.\n\nLet me compute the numerator first: a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ].\n\nI can write a\u00b2 as [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 ]/(a + b)^2, so the numerator becomes:\n\n[ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nX = [ (a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ) / (a + b)^2 ] / (a - b)^2.\n\nSimplify the numerator: a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2.\n\nExpand a\u00b2 (a + b)^2:\n\na\u00b2 (a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2) = a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2.\n\nSo the numerator is a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nHmm, that's getting complicated. Let me see if I can factor this.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let's compute a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2.\n\nThis is equal to [a (a + b)]^2 - b^2 = [a(a + b) - b][a(a + b) + b].\n\nWait, that's applying the difference of squares formula, which is x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = (x - y)(x + y).\n\nHere, x is a(a + b), y is b.\n\nSo x\u00b2 is a\u00b2 (a + b)^2, and y\u00b2 is b^2.\n\nSo,\n\nx - y = a(a + b) - b = a\u00b2 + ab - b.\n\nx + y = a(a + b) + b = a\u00b2 + ab + b.\n\nSo the numerator becomes (a\u00b2 + ab - b)(a\u00b2 + ab + b).\n\nThus, numerator is (a\u00b2 + ab - b)(a\u00b2 + ab + b) and denominator is (a + b)^2 multiplied by (a - b)^2.\n\nWait, but denominator is (a + b)^2 * (a - b)^2 = (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)^2.\n\nWait, now X is [ (a\u00b2 + ab - b)(a\u00b2 + ab + b) ] / (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)^2.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Let me see if I can factor the numerator further.\n\nWait, (a\u00b2 + ab - b)(a\u00b2 + ab + b) can be written as [ (a\u00b2 + ab) - b ][ (a\u00b2 + ab) + b ].\n\nWhich is again the difference of squares: (a\u00b2 + ab)^2 - b^2.\n\nSo the numerator is (a\u00b2 + ab)^2 - b^2.\n\nExpanding (a\u00b2 + ab)^2: a^4 + 2 a^3 b + a^2 b^2.\n\nSo numerator is a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nHmm, this doesn't seem to simplify easily. Let me check whether this approach is leading me anywhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should factor the denominator and see if any simplification can occur.\n\nDenominator is (a^2 - b^2)^2 = (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2.\n\nThe numerator is (a^2 + ab)^2 - b^2 = (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b), as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor a^2 + ab + b. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try plugging in some numbers to see if the initial approach was correct.\n\nLet me choose a=2 and b=1, for example.\n\nCompute the left side: a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2.\n\na=2, b=1: a\u00b2=4, a + b =3, so (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2=1/9.\n\nSo left side is 4 - 1/9 = 36/9 - 1/9 = 35/9.\n\nRight side is (a - b)^2 * X. a - b=1, so (a - b)^2=1. So 35/9 = 1 * X. So X=35/9.\n\nNow, let's check each option by plugging a=2, b=1.\n\nOption A: (a + b)(a - b) = (3)(1) =3.\n\nBut 35/9 is about 3.888, which is more than 3, so A is 3, which is incorrect.\n\nOption B: (a - b)^2 =1. So X=1, but 35/9 is not 1. So B is wrong.\n\nOption C: (a + b)^2 =9. So 35/9 would be 35/9= 35/9. So 35/9=9 * X \u2192 X=35/(9*9)=35/81. No, that's not matching.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. Wait, the question is a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 = (a - b)^2 * X.\n\nSo when a=2, b=1, as before, left side is 35/9, right is (1)^2 * X \u2192 X=35/9.\n\nNow, let me compute each option and see if any of them equals 35/9 when a=2, b=1.\n\nOption A: (a + b)(a - b) =3 *1=3. 3 is 27/9. 35/9 is not 27/9. So A is 3, which is less than 35/9. So A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: (a - b)^2=1. So X=1, but 35/9 is not 1. So no.\n\nOption C: (a + b)^2=9. Then X would be (35/9) / 1 =35/9. So 9 * X=35/9 \u2192 X=35/(81). No, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the equation is a\u00b2 - b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 = (a - b)^2 * X.\n\nSo when a=2, b=1, 4 - (1)/(3^2)=4 - 1/9=35/9. So 35/9 = (2 -1)^2 * X \u2192 35/9 = 1 * X \u2192 X=35/9.\n\nNone of the options A to D when evaluated at a=2, b=1 give X=35/9.\n\nSo the correct answer would be E) None of these.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me try to express the equation differently.\n\nWe have a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] = (a - b)^2 * X.\n\nI can factor a\u00b2 as (a + b)^2 - 2ab.\n\nWait, a\u00b2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab.\n\nSo substituting a\u00b2 in the equation:\n\n(a + b)^2 - 2ab - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] = (a - b)^2 * X.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the entire left-hand side as a single fraction.\n\nLeft side: a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] = [a^2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nWhich is [a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nSo,\n\n[ a\u00b2 (a^2 + 2ab + b^2 ) - b^2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nExpanding numerator:\n\na^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Let me factor:\n\na^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2 = a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nFactor terms:\n\n= a\u00b2 (a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2) - b\u00b2.\n\nBut a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2 is (a + b)^2, so:\n\n= a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2.\n\nWhich brings us back to the same expression.\n\nSo, numerator is [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2], denominator is (a + b)^2.\n\nSo the left side is [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nWe can write this as a\u00b2 - [b^2/(a + b)^2], which is where we started.\n\nSo, to find X, we have:\n\n[a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ] / (a + b)^2 = (a - b)^2 X.\n\nSo,\n\nX = [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ] / [ (a + b)^2 (a - b)^2 ) ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator.\n\nLet me factor numerator:\n\na\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 = [a (a + b)]^2 - (b)^2.\n\nWhich is a difference of squares: [a(a + b) - b][a(a + b) + b].\n\nSo,\n\n= [a^2 + ab - b][a^2 + ab + b].\n\nSo,\n\nX = [ (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) ] / [ (a + b)^2 (a - b)^2 ) ]\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be simplified.\n\nLet me write the denominator as (a + b)^2 (a - b)^2 = (a^2 - b^2)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nX = [ (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) ] / (a^2 - b^2)^2.\n\nNow, looking at the numerator:\n\n(a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) = (a^2 + ab)^2 - b^2.\n\nWhich is a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nNot sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator in another way.\n\nWait, let's look at (a^2 + ab - b). Can this be factored further?\n\nHmm, maybe not easily.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor (a^2 + ab - b) as a(a + b) - b.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the denominator (a^2 - b^2)^2, which is (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2.\n\nSo, perhaps, if I can factor numerator in terms of (a - b) or (a + b), that would be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the numerator as (a^2 + ab + b)(a^2 + ab - b) = [a(a + b) + b][a(a + b) - b].\n\nWhich is [x + y][x - y], where x = a(a + b) and y = b.\n\nWait, but that's what I did earlier.\n\nSo, perhaps the numerator is (x)^2 - y^2 = (a(a + b))^2 - b^2.\n\nSo, [a(a + b)]^2 = a\u00b2 (a + b)^2. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the numerator is a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2.\n\nWait, but this brings me back to where I started.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as (a\u00b2 + ab - b)(a\u00b2 + ab + b) = (a\u00b2 + ab)^2 - b^2.\n\nHmm, same as before.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me see if I can express X as a function of a and b.\n\nX = [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ] / [ (a + b)^2 (a - b)^2 ) ]\n\nI can factor (a + b)^2 in numerator and denominator:\n\n= [a\u00b2 - (b^2)/(a + b)^2 ] / [ (a - b)^2 ]\n\nWait, that's the original equation rearranged. So, perhaps I'm going in circles.\n\nAnother approach: Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.\n\nNumerator: a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2.\n\nDenominator: (a + b)^2 (a - b)^2.\n\nLet me see if I can factor numerator.\n\na\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 = a\u00b2 (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) - b^2 = a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor a^2 from the first three terms:\n\na^2 (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) - b^2 = a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor this as a difference of squares? Let me check.\n\nIs a^2 (a + b)^2 a square? Yes, it's [a (a + b)]^2. So,\n\na^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 = [a(a + b)]^2 - (b)^2.\n\nWhich is a difference of squares: [a(a + b) - b][a(a + b) + b].\n\nSo, that's [a^2 + ab - b][a^2 + ab + b].\n\nWhich brings me back again.\n\nSo, the denominator is (a + b)^2 (a - b)^2 = (a^2 - b^2)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nX = [ (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) ] / (a^2 - b^2)^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor (a^2 + ab - b) and (a^2 + ab + b) in terms of (a - b) or (a + b).\n\nLet me see: Let's take each term in the numerator.\n\na^2 + ab - b = a(a + b) - b.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlso, a^2 + ab + b = a(a + b) + b.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor out a from each term:\n\na^2 + ab - b = a(a + b) - b.\n\na^2 + ab + b = a(a + b) + b.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's the best I can do.\n\nWait, let me consider (a^2 + ab - b) = a(a + b) - b.\n\nSimilarly, (a^2 + ab + b) = a(a + b) + b.\n\nSo,\n\nX = [ (a(a + b) - b)(a(a + b) + b) ] / (a^2 - b^2)^2.\n\nNow, perhaps I can factor (a(a + b) - b) as (a(a + b) - b) = a^2 + ab - b.\n\nSimilarly, the denominator is (a^2 - b^2)^2 = [(a - b)(a + b)]^2.\n\nHmm, but I don't see an obvious way to cancel terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor the numerator as (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) = (a^2 + ab)^2 - b^2.\n\nWhich is again a difference of squares: [ (a^2 + ab) - b ][ (a^2 + ab) + b ], but that brings me back.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as (a^2 + ab)^2 - b^2 = (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b).\n\nBut again, no obvious cancellation with the denominator.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is indeed E) None of these, because none of the options A to D match the expression we found for X.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the initial equation setup.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpreted the original equation.\n\nThe problem states: a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2] (?) = (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/( (a + b)^2 ) ] = (a - b)^2 multiplied by the question mark.\n\nSo, the equation is a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] = (a - b)^2 * X.\n\nIf that's the case, then to find X, we can rearrange as:\n\nX = [a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ] / (a - b)^2.\n\nLet me compute this expression.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\na\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ].\n\nExpress a\u00b2 as [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 ]/(a + b)^2.\n\nSo numerator becomes [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ]/(a + b)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nX = [ [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ]/(a + b)^2 ] / (a - b)^2.\n\n= [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ] / [ (a + b)^2 (a - b)^2 ) ].\n\nWhich is same as earlier.\n\nSo, same result as before.\n\nTherefore, X would be [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ] / [ (a + b)^2 (a - b)^2 ) ].\n\nWhich doesn't match any of the given options, so the answer is E.\n\n\nThe problem requires finding the value of the question mark (?) in the equation:\n\n\\[\na^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2} \\cdot (\\text{?}) = (a - b)^2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Interpret the Equation\nThe equation can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\na^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2} \\cdot X = (a - b)^2,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( X \\) represents the question mark.
