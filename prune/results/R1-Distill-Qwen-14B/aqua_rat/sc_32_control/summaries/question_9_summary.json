      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about students attending prom night or debating sessions, and I need to find the maximum number who could have neither. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nHmm, the problem states that there are 200 students in total. At least 45% attended the prom night, and at least 35% took part in the debating session. I'm supposed to find the maximum number who didn't attend either.\n\nWait, let's break down the percentages. 45% of 200 is... let me calculate that. 45% is 0.45 times 200, which is 90 students. So at least 90 attended the prom. Similarly, 35% is 0.35 * 200 =70 students who took part in the debating session.\n\nThe question is about the maximum number who did neither. So I guess I need to find how many students could be outside both events. To maximize that number, I need to minimize the number of students who attended either event. But wait, no, wait a minute. Because if more students attend either, that would leave fewer who didn't attend either. So to maximize the number who did neither, I need as few as possible to have attended either event.\n\nWait, no, actually, the way these are phrased is \"at least 45% attended prom\" and \"at least 35% debated\". So the minimum number attending each event is 90 and 70 respectively. So the actual number attending each could be more than these, but not less. But wait, to find the maximum of neither, I want as few students as possible to have attended at least one event. Because the more students who attended either, the fewer left who didn't attend either.\n\nWait, no, wait again. I think I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The total number of students is 200. Let me denote:\n\n- P as the number of students who attended prom night. So P >= 90.\n- D as the number who debated. D >=70.\n\nWe need to find the maximum number of students who are in neither P nor D. Let's denote this as N.\n\nThe total number is 200 = P + D - (P \u2229 D) + N. Because some students might have attended both, so we subtract the overlap once. So,\n\nN = 200 - (P + D - (P \u2229 D)).\n\nBut to maximize N, I need to minimize the value of (P + D - (P \u2229 D)).\n\nWait, because N is 200 minus that value. So, lower the value inside, higher N is. So how can I minimize (P + D - (P \u2229 D))?\n\nHmm. Let me think about the inclusion-exclusion principle. The term (P + D - (P \u2229 D)) represents the number of students who attended either event, considering that some might have attended both.\n\nSo to minimize this, I need to maximize the overlap (P \u2229 D). Because then, P + D - (P \u2229 D) will be as small as possible.\n\nBecause if more students attended both, the total unique attendees would be lower.\n\nSo the maximum possible overlap is the minimum of P and D. Because you can't have more overlap than the smaller of the two.\n\nWait, but P is at least 90, D at least 70. So the maximum overlap possible is 70, because D is 70, so all 70 debaters could have also gone to prom. But wait, P is at least 90, so if all 70 debaters attended prom, that's possible.\n\nSo, to maximize the overlap (P \u2229 D), we can have all the D students also in P. Then, the number of students in either P or D is P + D - overlap.\n\nWait, but if D is 70, and all 70 are in P, then the number who attended prom is at least 90. So if 70 are in both, the number who only went to prom would be 90-70=20. So the total attendees are:\n\nOnly prom: 20\nBoth:70\nOnly debate:0 (since all debaters are in prom)\nWait, but D is at least 70, so if D is more than 70, then it's possible that some debaters are not in prom. But to maximize the overlap, we'd have D exactly 70, all in prom.\n\nWait, but wait, D could be more than 70. Because the problem says at least 35% (70) took part. So D could be, say, 80. But in that case, the maximum overlap would be 70, because P is at least 90. Wait no, because P is 90, and if D is 80, maximum overlap is 90 (since P can't be less than 90). But D is 80, so the maximum overlap is 80, because you can't have more than the size of D.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this mathematically.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nWe have:\n\nP >=90\n\nD >=70\n\nWe want to maximize N.\n\nN = 200 - (P + D - B), where B is the number who attended both.\n\nSo to maximize N, we need to minimize (P + D - B). Which is the same as minimizing P + D - B.\n\nHow to minimize that?\n\nWe can think of P + D - B as the union of P and D. To minimize the union, we need to maximize B.\n\nSo B can be as large as possible, but it's bounded by the size of P and D. The maximum possible B is the minimum of P and D. Because you can't have more overlap than the smaller of the two groups.\n\nWait, if P is 90 and D is 70, then the maximum possible B is 70. Because all debaters can attend prom, but since D is 70, B can't be more than that.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nIf B is as big as possible (70), then P + D - B = 90 +70 -70 =90.\n\nSo then N would be 200 -90=110.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Can B be 70 if P is exactly 90 and D is exactly 70? Because that would mean that all D students are in P. So the 70 in D are part of the 90 in P. Then, the number who attended prom but not debate is 90-70=20. So the total in either is 90, as calculated.\n\nSo in this scenario, N is 110.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a way to have B larger than 70. For example, if P is more than 90, say 100, and D is 70. Then, B can be 70 (all D in P), so P + D - B = 100 +70 -70=100, so N=100.\n\nThat gives N=100, which is less than 110. So to maximize N, we need to have as small a value of P + D - B as possible, which occurs when B is as large as possible. So the scenario where P is exactly 90 and D is exactly 70, with B=70, gives the largest N.\n\nWait another thing: could D be higher than 70? For example, D=100. Then, B would be 90, because P is 90. So P + D - B would be 90 +100 -90=100. So N=100, which is less than 110.\n\nHmm, so the maximum N occurs when D is exactly 70, and B is 70, which is the maximum possible in that case.\n\nSo N=200-90=110. But wait, 110 is one of the options. Looking at the options, E is 110.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the problem says \"at least\" 45% (90) attended prom and \"at least\" 35% (70) debated. So P is >=90 and D is >=70.\n\nIf P is exactly 90, and D is exactly 70, then the maximum possible overlap is 70, making N=110.\n\nIf P is more than 90, say 91, then if D is 70, the maximum B is 70. Then P + D - B =91 +70 -70=91. So N=200-91=109, which is less than 110.\n\nAlternatively, if D is more than 70, say 71, and P is 90, then B can be 70 (since D is 71, but P is 90, so the maximum B is 71, because you can't have more than D. Wait, no, B can't exceed D. Wait, B can't be larger than D, which is 71 in this case. So in that case, B=71. So P + D - B =90 +71 -71 =90. So N=110 again.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me see: if D is 71, which is still >=70, then B can be 71, so P + D - B =90+71-71=90. So N=110.\n\nSo in that case, N is still 110. So if D is larger than 70, but B is as large as D, which is allowed because P is 90 and D is 71, then the calculation still gives N=110.\n\nWait, so is it possible for N to be 110 even when D>70?\n\nYes, because if D is 71, and all 71 are in P, then B=71, which is allowed since P is 90. So then, P + D - B =90+71-71=90 \u2192 N=110.\n\nSo the maximum N remains 110 regardless of whether D is exactly 70 or more, as long as B is as large as possible.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Suppose D increases beyond 70, say 80. But then, B can be up to 80, but P is at least 90. So in that case, P + D - B =90 +80 -80=90, so N=110. So even with D=80, N is still 110.\n\nSo regardless of how much D exceeds 70, as long as B is D, P + D - B would be 90, leading to N=110.\n\nSo the maximum N is 110. But wait, looking back at the options, E is 110. But wait, let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\nA)27\nB)81\nC)90\nD)99\nE)110\n\nSo E is 110.\n\nBut wait, I thought the answer would be 110, but I'm a bit uncertain. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of students who neither attended prom nor debated is equal to the total minus the minimum number of students who attended at least one of the two events.\n\nSo the minimum number attending at least one event is when the overlap is maximum.\n\nSo the minimum number attending at least one event is P + D - B, where B is maximum possible. Which is min(P, D).\n\nWait, if P is 90 and D is 70, then the maximum B is 70. So the minimum number attending at least one event is 90+70 -70=90.\n\nThus, the maximum number of students who attended neither is 200-90=110. So N=110.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nWait, but another way: the maximum possible number of students in neither is achieved when the number in at least one is as small as possible.\n\nWhich is achieved when the overlap between P and D is as large as possible. Because that reduces the total unique attendees.\n\nSo yes, that confirms N=110.\n\nBut looking back, the options have E as 110. So the answer should be E.\n\n\nTo determine the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we analyze the given constraints and apply the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **Total number of students**: 200.\n2. **At least 45% attended the prom night**:  \n   \\( P \\geq 0.45 \\times 200 = 90 \\).\n3. **At least 35% took part in the debating session**:  \n   \\( D \\geq 0.35 \\times 200 = 70 \\).\n\nWe aim to maximize the number of students who neither attended the prom nor the debating session, denoted as \\( N \\). Using the inclusion-exclusion principle:  \n\\[\nN = 200 - (P + D - B),\n\\]\nwhere \\( B \\) is the number of students who attended both events. To maximize \\( N \\), we need to minimize \\( P + D - B \\), which occurs when \\( B \\) is as large as possible.\n\n### Maximizing Overlap (\\( B \\)):\nThe maximum possible overlap \\( B \\) is the smaller of \\( P \\) and \\( D \\). Since \\( P \\geq 90 \\) and \\( D \\geq 70 \\), the maximum \\( B \\) is 70 (all debaters also attended the prom). Substituting \\( P = 90 \\), \\( D = 70 \\), and \\( B = 70 \\) into the equation for \\( N \\):  \n\\[\nN = 200 - (90 + 70 - 70) = 200 - 90 = 110.\n\\]\n\n### Verification:\n- If \\( P > 90 \\) or \\( D > 70 \\), the overlap \\( B \\) cannot exceed the smaller of \\( P \\) and \\( D \\). For example:\n  - If \\( P = 91 \\) and \\( D = 70 \\), \\( B = 70 \\), so \\( N = 200 - (91 + 70 - 70) = 200 - 91 = 109 \\), which is less than 110.\n  - If \\( P = 90 \\) and \\( D = 71 \\), \\( B = 71 \\), so \\( N = 200 - (90 + 71 - 71) = 200 - 90 = 110 \\), which remains the same.\n\nThus, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debating session is **110**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**E) 110**",
