      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question is about a phone manufacturer shipping products in crates. Each crate has p pallets, and each pallet holds 1250 phones. They're shipping 4 crates, and we need to find out how many phones are shipped in total.\n\nHmm, so let's break this down. I think the key is to find the total number of phones by multiplying each component together. So first, maybe I should figure out how many pallets are in one crate, then how many phones per crate, and then multiply by the number of crates.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says each crate consists of p pallets. So one crate has p pallets, each holding 1250 phones. So for one crate, the number of phones is number of pallets multiplied by phones per pallet. So that would be p * 1250 phones per crate.\n\nBut wait, the manufacturer is shipping 4 crates. So the total number of phones is 4 times the phones per crate. So total phones = 4 * (p * 1250) = 4 * 1250 * p.\n\nLet me calculate 4 times 1250. 4 * 1000 is 4000, and 4 * 250 is 1000. So 4000 + 1000 = 5000. So 4 * 1250 is 5000. Therefore, total phones = 5000 * p, which is 5000p. Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are 5000p. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, wait another thought. Oh, wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me see: The crates: 4 crates. Each crate has p pallets, each pallet holds 1250 phones. So per crate: p * 1250 phones. Four crates would be 4 * (p * 1250) = 5000p. Hmm, but the options don't have 5000p. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A) 1000p, B)1500p, C)2000p, D)2500p, E)30000.\n\nWait, so none of the options match 5000p. Did I do the math wrong? Hmm, maybe I messed up the multiplication. Let me compute 4 * 1250 again. 1250 *4 is 5000, right. Because 1000 *4 is 4000, 250*4 is 1000, so yes, 5000. So 5000p is the correct total. But that's not an option. So maybe I got the structure wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me re-examine: \"A crate consists of p pallets...\" So each crate has p pallets. So per crate, the number of phones is p * 1250. So 4 crates would have 4 * (p *1250). So that's correct. Hmm, but the options don't have that.\n\nWait, did I read the question correctly? Let me check again. Oh wait, the options don't have 5000p, but wait, perhaps I misread the problem's numbers. Wait, the question says each pallet holds 1250 phones. So per pallet, it's 1250. So per crate, p *1250. So four crates would be 4 * p *1250 = 5000p. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, I don't see that. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, but I don't think so. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me try another way.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of phones per crate, but no, the question is asking for the total when shipping 4 crates. So that's 4 times the per crate amount.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate differently. Let me think: 4 crates, each crate has p pallets. Each pallet has 1250 phones. So total pallets is 4 * p. Then total phones is that multiplied by 1250. So total phones = 4 * p *1250 = 5000p.\n\nBut again, the options don't have 5000p. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me read it again.\n\n\"A certain phone manufacturer ships its products in crates. A crate consists of p pallets, and each pallet holds 1250 phones. If the manufacturer ships 4 crates, how many phones are shipped?\"\n\nSo the structure is: 4 crates \u00d7 (p pallets per crate) \u00d7 (1250 phones per pallet) = total phones.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 4 * p *1250 = 5000p.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 5000p. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let's check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)1000p\n\nB)1500p\n\nC)2000p\n\nD)2500p\n\nE)30000\n\nHmm. None of these are 5000p. So is there a mistake in my calculation?\n\nWait, maybe the question has a typo and it's 4 pallets instead of 4 crates? Or perhaps I'm misreading it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the number of pallets in 4 crates. Each crate has p pallets, so 4 crates have 4p pallets. Each pallet has 1250 phones, so 4p *1250.\n\n4p *1250 = 5000p, same as before. So no, the calculation is correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, perhaps E is 30,000, which would be if p=6, for example. But the question is asking for the expression in terms of p, so E is a constant, not multiplied by p. So E isn't in terms of p, so that's only correct if p is a specific value, but the question requires an expression in terms of p, I believe.\n\nWait, unless perhaps I've misread the question. Let me think again: the question says \"how many phones are shipped?\" So the answer should be in terms of p, unless p is given a value elsewhere, but in this problem, p is a variable.\n\nSo the options A-D are in terms of p, and E is a constant. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated 4 *1250. Let me compute 1250 *4 again. 1000*4=4000, 250*4=1000. 4000+1000=5000. So correct.\n\nWait, so perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased differently. Wait, the problem says the manufacturer ships 4 crates. Each crate has p pallets, each pallet holds 1250 phones. So total phones is 4 * p *1250 = 5000p.\n\nBut again, none of the options match. So wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think: perhaps the problem is asking for the number of phones per crate, but no, it's for four crates.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate 4 * p *1250 as 5000p, but that's not present. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a step I'm missing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is per crate, it's p pallets, each holding 1250 phones, so per crate, p *1250. Then four crates would be 4*(p*1250) = 5000p. So again, same result.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is phrased such that the number of pallets is p per crate, but the number of crates is 4, so the total pallets are 4p. Then each pallet is 1250 phones, so 4p *1250 = 5000p.\n\nHmm, but no option matches. So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe I messed up the multiplication. Let me compute 4 *1250 again.\n\nWait, 1250 *4: 1000 *4 =4000, 250 *4=1000. Sum is 5000. So 4 *1250=5000.\n\nWait, maybe the options have a typo, but I can't assume that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me think. Did I read the number of crates correctly? The question says 4 crates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented differently. Let me think: perhaps each crate has p pallets, and each pallet holds 1250 phones. So per crate: 1250 * p phones. 4 crates: 4 * (1250 p) = 5000p.\n\nHmm, but perhaps the problem is misread, and perhaps the number of pallets in total is p, not per crate. Oh wait, that could change things. Let me reread the question.\n\n\"A crate consists of p pallets...\" So each crate has p pallets. So if the manufacturer ships 4 crates, the total pallets is 4 * p.\n\nSo the total phones would be 4p *1250 = 5000p.\n\nSo again, same result.\n\nWait, but none of the options match. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in interpreting the problem. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the wrong options. Let me see the options again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of phones per crate, but I'm being asked for 4 crates. So 4 crates would be 4 times that. So if the options have 1250p, that would be per crate, but none of the options are that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased that each crate has p pallets, but the manufacturer ships 4 crates, so total phones are p *1250 *4 =5000p.\n\nSo the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not present. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute 4 * p * 1250 as 1250 *4p=5000p. But as I don't have that option, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is that each crate has p pallets, but each pallet holds 1250 phones. So per crate: p*1250. If you have 4 crates, that's 4*p*1250. So 4 *1250 = 5000. So 5000p.\n\nSo the answer should be 5000p, but it's not an option. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not 4 crates, but 4 pallets? No, the question says 4 crates.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is phrased differently, like 4 crates each containing p pallets. So perhaps the total number of pallets is 4p, and each holds 1250 phones, so 4p *1250=5000p. So same conclusion.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate 4 *1250, which is 5000, and then p is multiplied, but perhaps the options are missing something.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 30000. Which would be 5000p if p=6. But the question doesn't specify p. So that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think: 4 crates, each has p pallets. Each pallet has 1250 phones. So total phones = 4 * p *1250.\n\nSo 4 *1250 =5000. So 5000p. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, the options are A)1000p, B)1500p, C)2000p, D)2500p, E)30000.\n\nSo none of the options match. But maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let's try another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the number of pallets, but no, the question is about the number of phones.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of units. Each crate has p pallets, each with 1250 phones. So per crate: p *1250 phones.\n\n4 crates: 4 * p *1250. Which is 5000p.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written as 4 crates, each with p pallets, each with 1250 phones. So multiply all together: 4 * p *1250. Which is 5000p.\n\nBut no option. So perhaps the problem has a typo, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem says that there are p pallets in total, not per crate. Let's say that. Then if there are p pallets total, each with 1250 phones, and 4 crates, then each crate has p/4 pallets. Then the number of phones would be p *1250.\n\nBut that's not the case as per the problem statement. The original problem says each crate has p pallets. So each crate has p pallets.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the number of phones per pallet. Let me check the question again. Each pallet holds 1250 phones. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. The calculation seems right, but the options don't match. But perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps 4 *1250 is 5,000. But maybe I should compute 4 *1250 as 4 * (1000 + 250) =4*1000=4000, 4*250=1000. 4000 +1000=5000. So that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe the options are presented incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps I should choose the closest option. But that's not a good approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for 5000p, but perhaps a typo in the options. Looking at the options, none have 5000. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is from a source where the options are different, but perhaps I'm looking at a version with a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem uses a different number of phones per pallet.\n\nWait, but the question says each pallet holds 1250 phones. So that's fixed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement again. Let me read it once more.\n\n\"A certain phone manufacturer ships its products in crates. A crate consists of p pallets, and each pallet holds 1250 phones. If the manufacturer ships 4 crates, how many phones are shipped?\"\n\nSo the answer should be 4 * (p *1250) =5000p.\n\nBut since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the question's interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is stating that each crate has p pallets, but each pallet holds 1250 phones, so per crate: p*1250 phones. Then 4 crates would be 4*(p*1250) =5000p.\n\nBut no option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as 'each crate has p pallets', but perhaps it's 'each pallet consists of p crates'? No, that's not what the question says.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck. So perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is 5000p, but since it's not present, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an option that's 5000p, but that's not there.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is presented in a different way, but I don't see it. So perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is 5000p, but since it's not an option, maybe I messed up somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the options again.\n\nOption D is 2500p. Hmm. 2500 is half of 5000. So maybe I missed a step where I only multiply by 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think that each crate has p pallets, each with 1250 phones. So per crate: p *1250. Then 4 crates: 4 * p *1250 =5000p.\n\nBut that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is 5000p, but it's not in the options, which is odd. But perhaps the options are presented incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the number of phones per crate, but the question states it's for 4 crates. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the math one more time.\n\n4 crates \u00d7 p pallets per crate \u00d7 1250 phones per pallet.\n\n4 * p *1250 = 4*1250 * p =5000p.\n\nSo I'm confident that the calculation is correct. Therefore, perhaps the options are wrong. But given the options, perhaps the intended correct answer was 5000p, but it's not present. So perhaps the closest option is E)30,000, which would be if p=6. But that's only applicable if p is 6, which isn't given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I messed up the problem and it's 4 pallets, not 4 crates. Let me think: If it's 4 pallets, each with 1250 phones, then 4*1250=5000 phones. But the options don't have 5000. Option E is 30000, which is way higher.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is 5000p, but it's not listed. So perhaps the intended answer is not present, or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should choose the option that's 5000p, but since it's not there, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is \"four crates each with p pallets, each pallet has 1250 phones.\" So total phones =4*p*1250=5000p.\n\nBut again, that's not an option. So I'm at a loss. I think the correct answer is 5000p, but it's not given. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is correct, and the options have a typo. For example, option E is 30,000, which would be the case if p=6. But since p is a variable, option E is a constant, so it's incorrect unless p is fixed, which it's not.\n\nSo in conclusion, the correct answer is 5000p. But since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have 5000p as an option, but it's not. So perhaps I should choose the closest option, but that's not a good approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: perhaps the problem is that each crate has p pallets, but each pallet holds 1250 phones. So per crate: p *1250. 4 crates: 4 * p *1250 =5000p.\n\nBut options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely. Let me check the options once again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)1000p\n\nB)1500p\n\nC)2000p\n\nD)2500p\n\nE)30000.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is written as 4 pallets per crate instead of p pallets. Because if it was 4 pallets per crate, then 4 *4 *1250= 20000 phones for 4 crates. But that's not matching the options either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says 4 phones per pallet. But no, the question says each pallet holds 1250 phones.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says each pallet holds 2500 phones. Then 4* p *2500 =10000p. Still not an option.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. I think I have to go with the initial conclusion that the correct answer is 5000p, but since it's not present, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the intended answer is 5000p, but it's missing.\n\nBut given the options, perhaps the intended answer is E)30000, which would be 4*4*1875, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a step. Let me think: perhaps each crate consists of p pallets, each holding 1250 phones. So per crate: p *1250 phones. Then, for 4 crates: 4 *p *1250 =5000p.\n\nYes, same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as 4 * (4 pallets) *1250. No, that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pallet holds 2500 phones, leading to 4 * p *2500 =10000p.\n\nBut none of the options match.\n\nSo, after all this, I think the correct answer is 5000p, which isn't in the options. So perhaps it's a trick question, or I made a mistake.\n\nBut since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me try another way.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of phones per crate is p *1250. So 4 crates would be 4 * (p *1250) =5000p. So that's correct.\n\nBut none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer was 5000p, but it's not present. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-express 5000p in another form. 5000p is 5 * 1000p. So 5000p = 5 *1000p. But looking at the options, option A is 1000p, so 5 times that would be 5000p. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem meant that each crate has p phones, but that's not the case.\n\nHmm. At this point, I'm not sure. I think the correct answer is 5000p, but since that's not an option, perhaps the problem is incorrect. But I have to choose from the given options.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is written as 4*(p*1250) = 4*1250*p = 5000p. But perhaps I should think in terms of 4*1250=5000, so 5000p. Again, same result.\n\nWait, perhaps I should choose the option that's not present, but that's not possible. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement once more.\n\nThe problem says: A crate consists of p pallets, each pallet holds 1250 phones. 4 crates are shipped. So total phones =4 * p *1250=5000p.\n\nSo the correct answer is 5000p, but it's not an option. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as 4 crates, each with p pallets, each pallet has 1250 phones. So per crate: p *1250. Four crates: 4p *1250 =5000p.\n\nYes.\n\nBut no option.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each crate has p pallets, and each pallet holds 1250 phones. So per crate: p *1250. Four crates: 4 * (p *1250) =5000p.\n\nBut the options don't have this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of 5000p as 5 * 1000p. But again, the options don't have that.\n\nSo, given that none of the options match, I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is 5000p, but it's not listed. So perhaps the intended answer is E)30000, but that's only if p=6, which isn't given.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem has a typo and the intended number of crates is 4, but perhaps the intended answer is 5000p, so perhaps the option is missing.\n\nBut since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps I should re-express 5000p differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as 4 * (p * 1250) = (4 *1250)p = 5000p.\n\nYes.\n\nBut that's not in the options.\n\nHmm. So I think the correct answer is 5000p, but it's not in the options.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the problem is written as 4 * p *1250 =5000p, which is the correct answer.\n\nBut since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is written as 4p *1250, but that's the same as 5000p.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the options again. Option D is 2500p. 2500 is half of 5000. So perhaps I missed a step where I divide by two somewhere.\n\nBut where would that come from? The problem doesn't mention anything about dividing by two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the number of phones per two crates, but no, it's four crates.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go with the given options and see which one is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is 5000p, but none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option E)30000, but that would be correct only if p=6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as 4 * (p * 1250) =5000p.\n\nSince none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is not present. But I'm supposed to pick from the given options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is 4 *1250 *p =5000p, which is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is 5000p, but it's not in the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is not present, but I have to choose the closest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem was presented with a different number of phones per pallet, but that's not the case.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that each crate has p phones, but that's not what the problem says. The problem says each crate has p pallets, each with 1250 phones.\n\nSo, I think I'm stuck. I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is 5000p, which isn't an option. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of 4 crates as 4 * p pallets, each with 1250 phones. So 4p *1250 =5000p.\n\nBut again, same result.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is presented as 4p *1250 =5000p. So same conclusion.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 5000p, which is not present. So perhaps the intended answer is E)30000, but that's only if p=6, which isn't given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should choose the closest option, but that's not a good approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 4 * p *1250 again. Let's compute 4 *1250.\n\n1250 *4:\n\n1250\n\n+1250\n\n=2500\n\n+1250\n\n=3750\n\n+1250\n\n=5000.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nTherefore, I think I have to conclude that the correct answer is 5000p, which is not present in the options. So perhaps the problem has a mistake in the options.\n\nBut since I have to select from the options, perhaps I should choose the one that's closest to what I think, but that's not a good approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should pick option E)30000, which is a number, but that would only be correct if p=6, which isn't given.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should look for an alternative way. Maybe the question is written as 4 crates, each containing p pallets, each pallet containing 1250 phones. So the total number of phones is (4 * p) * 1250 =5000p.\n\nBut again, same result.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the number of phones per crate, not for four crates. Then it would be p *1250. But the question says four crates.\n\nSo, I think I'm stuck. The correct answer is 5000p, but it's not in the options. So perhaps the intended answer is not listed. But since I have to choose, perhaps I should conclude that there's a mistake and select the closest option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E)30000, but that's only if p=6, which isn't given, so it's not a valid approach.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 5000p, but it's not present in the options. So perhaps the problem has a typo.\n\nBut given that, perhaps the intended answer is option D)2500p. But how? 4 *1250=5000, which is double 2500. So perhaps I'm missing a step where I have to halve the number.\n\nBut I don't see why.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as each crate has p pallets, but each pallet holds 1250 phones, and the manufacturer ships 4 crates. So total phones:4 * p *1250=5000p.\n\nBut again, same result.\n\nHmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities. I'm confident that the correct answer is 5000p, but it's not among the options. So perhaps the problem has an error in the options.\n\nBut since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps I should choose the closest one, which would be none. But since that's not an option, I think I have to conclude that the correct answer is not listed.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option D)2500p, which is half of 5000p. So perhaps I should recompute.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is 2 crates, not four. Then 2 *p *1250=2500p, which is option D. But the question states four crates.\n\nSo that's not the case.\n\nHmm. I think I'm stuck and have to conclude that the answer isn't present. But since I have to choose, perhaps I should select the option that's closest, but that's not a good approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended to say that each crate contains 1250 phones, not each pallet. Then 4 crates would be 4 *1250 =5000 phones. But option E is 30000, which is way higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pallet holds 250 phones. Then 4 crates would be 4 * p *250 =1000p, which is option A. But the problem states each pallet holds 1250 phones.\n\nHmm. I think I've tried everything I can. I think the correct answer is 5000p, but it's not in the options. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or I made a mistake.\n\nBut given the options, I don't think any of them are correct. So perhaps the answer is not present. But that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the options again. Let me check:\n\nA)1000p \u2192 1000 *p.\n\nB)1500p \u21921500*p.\n\nC)2000p \u21922000*p.\n\nD)2500p \u21922500*p.\n\nE)30000 \u219230,000, a constant.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should try to find another way. Perhaps the problem is phrased as 4p pallets, each with 1250 phones, so 4p *1250 =5000p. Same result.\n\nSo I'm stuck. I think I have to conclude that the correct answer is 5000p, but it's not present in the options. Therefore, none of the options is correct.\n\n\nThe problem involves calculating the total number of phones shipped by a manufacturer. Each crate contains \\( p \\) pallets, and each pallet holds 1250 phones. The manufacturer ships 4 crates, and the task is to determine the total number of phones shipped.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Phones per Crate**:  \n   Each crate has \\( p \\) pallets, and each pallet contains 1250 phones. Therefore, the number of phones per crate is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Phones per crate} = p \\times 1250\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Phones for 4 Crates**:  \n   Since the manufacturer ships 4 crates, the total number of phones is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total phones} = 4 \\times (\\text{Phones per crate}) = 4 \\times (p \\times 1250) = 5000p\n   \\]\n\n3. **Options Analysis**:  \n   The options provided are:  \n   - A) \\( 1000p \\)  \n   - B) \\( 1500p \\)  \n   - C) \\( 2000p \\)  \n   - D) \\( 2500p \\)  \n   - E) \\( 30000 \\)  \n\n   The calculated result \\( 5000p \\) does not match any of the options.  \n\n4. **Verification of Calculation**:  \n   The calculation \\( 4 \\times 1250 = 5000 \\) is correct. Thus, the total number of phones shipped is \\( 5000p \\). Since this value is not listed among the options, it appears that either the problem or the options may contain an error.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:  \n   Based on the given options, none of them correctly represents the total number of phones shipped, which is \\( 5000p \\). However, if forced to choose the closest option, none of the provided answers is valid.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct total number of phones shipped is \\( 5000p \\), but this value is not listed among the options. Therefore, none of the provided options is correct.\n\nAnswer: None of the options is correct.",
