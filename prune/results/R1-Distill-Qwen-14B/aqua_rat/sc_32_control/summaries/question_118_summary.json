      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where there's a square piece of paper with each side being 20 cm. On opposite sides, there are two semicircles drawn, using those sides as diameters. Then, these semicircles are cut down, and I need to find the area of the remaining paper.\n\nHmm, let me visualize this. So the square has sides of 20 cm. If two semicircles are drawn on opposite sides, each with a diameter of 20 cm. So each semicircle would have a radius of 10 cm, right? Because the radius is half the diameter.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. When they say the semicircles are drawn on opposite sides, does that mean they are on adjacent sides or opposite as in left and right, top and bottom? Oh, the question says \"opposite as diameters.\" So maybe they are on opposite sides of the square. Like, if the square is ABCD, the semicircles could be on the top and bottom sides, each with diameter 20 cm.\n\nBut wait, wait. The square has four sides. If two semicircles are drawn on opposite sides, each of those sides becomes the diameter for a semicircle. So each semicircle has a diameter of 20 cm, so radius 10 cm. But wait, if the semicircles are on opposite sides, their areas might overlap in the middle? Or maybe they're drawn outward, not overlapping because they're on opposite sides.\n\nWait, but when you cut them out, you're removing the area of the semicircles from the square. So the remaining area is the area of the square minus the areas of the two semicircles.\n\nWait, but two semicircles make a full circle. Because each semicircle is half a circle. So two semicircles (each 1/2) would add up to 1 full circle. So the area removed is that of a circle with radius 10 cm.\n\nSo the area of the square is side squared. Side is 20 cm, so 20^2 = 400 cm\u00b2.\n\nThe area of the circle is \u03c0r\u00b2. r is 10 cm. So \u03c0*(10)^2 = 100\u03c0 cm\u00b2.\n\nSo the remaining area is 400 - 100\u03c0.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Each semicircle is on opposite sides. So one is on the top side, the other on the bottom. Each has a diameter of 20 cm, so radius 10 cm. So each semicircle's area is (1/2)*\u03c0*(10)^2 = 50\u03c0. Two semicircles would be 100\u03c0.\n\nSo yes, subtracting 100\u03c0 from 400.\n\nBut let me think again. The problem says the semicircles are drawn on opposite sides as diameters. So each semicircle's diameter is a side of the square. So the square's side is 20 cm, making each semicircle's diameter 20 cm. So each is a half-circle with area 50\u03c0. So two of them would be 100\u03c0.\n\nSo the area remaining is 400 - 100\u03c0.\n\nWait, but what's the value of \u03c0 to use here? The problem gives options as around 8.7something. So let's calculate 400 - 100\u03c0 numerically.\n\nWhat's the approximate value of \u03c0? Let's take 3.1416.\n\nSo 100\u03c0 is approximately 314.16.\n\n400 - 314.16 = 85.84 cm\u00b2? Wait, but the options are about 8.7 something, which is way smaller. Wait, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, that can't be right because 85 cm\u00b2 is much larger than the options given. The options are around 8.7, so perhaps I made an error in the calculation.\n\nWait, maybe the square is 20 cm in area? No, wait, the square is 20 cm on each side, so area is 400 cm\u00b2. Subtracting 100\u03c0 (about 314.16) would give 85.84 cm\u00b2, which isn't matching any of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the square is 20 cm in perimeter? No, the problem says it's a square form whose one side is 20 cm. So the side is 20 cm, area 400.\n\nWait, perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the same side, but that doesn't make sense. Or maybe it's a different configuration.\n\nWait, perhaps the square is of side 20 cm, and the semicircles are drawn on adjacent sides, but that's not the case because the problem says opposites.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the two semicircles are drawn on the same side, but on opposite ends. No, that's probably not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the area removed isn't the sum of the two semicircles but something else. Let me think again.\n\nOh, wait! Maybe the semicircles are drawn on the same side, but as in, one on each end, making a full circle when combined. But no, the problem says opposites, so perhaps each is on opposite sides of the square.\n\nWait, but perhaps the square's sides are 20 cm, but the semicircles are drawn inside the square. So when you cut them down, you're removing that area from the square.\n\nWait, but if each semicircle is on opposite sides, meaning that each is drawn on a different side. For example, the top side has a semicircle drawn above the square, and the bottom side's semicircle is drawn below. So their areas don't overlap with the square's area. So when you cut them, you're only removing the area inside the square. Wait, no, because the semicircles are drawn on the square's sides as diameters. So if they're drawn inside the square, then each semicircle is part of the square's boundary.\n\nWait, maybe the semicircles are drawn on the outside of the square, so when you cut them, you're removing the semicircular parts outside the square. But then the remaining area would just be the square's area, which is 400, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the inside of the square. So each semicircle is inside, and when you cut them out, you remove that area from the square.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the semicircles are drawn on the square's opposite sides as diameters, then each semicircle is inside the square. So each semicircle's diameter is 20 cm, so radius 10 cm.\n\nBut wait, if the square's side is 20 cm, and the semicircles are drawn inside, would they fit?\n\nLet me imagine the square. If I draw a semicircle on the top side as diameter, it would bulge upwards. Similarly, a semicircle on the bottom side would bulge downwards. But wait, the square is a flat 2D object, so the semicircles would be inside it.\n\nWait, no, actually, the square is a flat piece of paper. So if you draw a semicircle on one side, it's either drawn inside the square or outside.\n\nWait, but if the semicircles are drawn on opposite sides as diameters, perhaps they are on the top and bottom edges, each with a diameter of 20 cm, meaning the semicircles are inside the square. So each semicircle would have a radius of 10 cm and would be in the center of the top and bottom edges.\n\nWait, but the square's height is 20 cm. So the semicircle on the top edge would have a radius of 10 cm, so the top of this semicircle would be 10 cm above the top edge. But the square is only 20 cm tall, so that's only possible if the semicircles are drawn inside the square.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because the semicircle on the top would require 10 cm of space above the top edge, which isn't part of the square. So perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the outside of the square, so each is a half-circle that doesn't overlap with the square's area.\n\nWait, but then when you cut them out, you're removing the semicircular areas from the square. But that doesn't make sense because the semicircles are outside, so they don't take away from the square's area.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem.\n\n\"Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?\"\n\nSo, the paper is a square, and two semicircles are drawn on opposite sides. So, perhaps each semicircle is on the top and bottom edges. Each has diameter 20 cm, so radius 10 cm. When you cut them, you are removing the semicircles from the paper.\n\nBut wait, if the semicircles are on the top and bottom edges, when you cut them out, you're removing those areas. So the remaining area is square's area minus the two semicircles.\n\nWait, so each semicircle is 0.5 * \u03c0 * r\u00b2. r is 10 cm.\n\nEach semicircle area is 0.5 * \u03c0 * (10)^2 = 50\u03c0 cm\u00b2.\n\nTwo semicircles: 100\u03c0 cm\u00b2.\n\nSquare area: 20^2 = 400 cm\u00b2.\n\nSo remaining area is 400 - 100\u03c0.\n\nBut wait, 100\u03c0 is approximately 314.16, so 400 - 314.16 is 85.84 cm\u00b2. But the options are around 8.7 something, which is much smaller.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Is the square's side 20 cm, or is the square's perimeter 20 cm? Because that would change things. But the question clearly states, \"one side is 20 cm.\" So each side is 20 cm. So area is 400.\n\nWait, unless the square is made of something else. Or perhaps the semicircles are overlapping, but that doesn't make sense if they're on opposite sides.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpret the diameters. Maybe the diameters are not the full length of the side but something else. Or perhaps the semicircles are drawn on adjacent sides, but that's not what the question says.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps it's a typo. Maybe the square is 20 cm in perimeter, but that would make each side 5 cm, which would change a lot.\n\nBut the problem says, \"one side is 20 cm,\" so that's 20 cm per side.\n\nWait, perhaps the semicircles are not both inside the square. Maybe one is on each side, but they are folded or something, but I don't think that's relevant here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the two semicircles are drawn on the same side, making a full circle. So, each semicircle is on opposite ends, but that would make a full circle of diameter 20 cm. But that would mean the area is 50\u03c0, not 100\u03c0.\n\nWait, but the question says \"two semicircles are drawn on its opposites as diameters.\" So perhaps each semicircle is on an opposite edge, but each has a diameter of 20 cm. So perhaps the semicircles are on the left and right sides, each with diameter 20 cm. So again, each is 50\u03c0, two semicircles sum to 100\u03c0, so remaining area is 400 - 100\u03c0.\n\nBut again, the options don't match that. So I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that the paper is in a square form, but the actual area of the paper is 20 cm\u00b2. No, the question says each side is 20 cm. So area is 400 cm\u00b2.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the square is of side length 20 units, but each semi-circle has a diameter of 20 cm. Wait, but that's what I already considered.\n\nWait, perhaps the area is 400 cm\u00b2, but the remaining area is 85.84 cm\u00b2, but the options are 8.7 something. So I must have made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about removing the semicircles from the square but about the remaining area after cutting along the semicircles. Perhaps the area outside the semicircles is left. But that would depend on how it's drawn.\n\nWait, another angle: maybe the two semicircles are drawn on the same side of the square, but as in, one on each end, making a circle when combined. So for example, imagine the top side is 20 cm, and on each end (left and right), a semicircle is drawn with diameter 20 cm. But wait, that's not possible because each end is just a point. Or perhaps the semicircles are on the top and bottom edges, each with diameter equal to the side length, 20 cm. So each semicircle spans the entire edge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two semicircles are drawn on adjacent sides, creating a shape that's like a circle in the corner. But the question says opposite sides.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach.\n\nIf the area remaining is around 8.7, then the square's area must be about 8.7 plus the area of the two semicircles. 400 can't be the square's area because 400 is way larger than the options. So perhaps the square's area is 100 cm\u00b2, but that would make each side 10 cm. But the problem says each side is 20 cm.\n\nWait, maybe the semicircles are drawn on the same side, so each has a diameter of 20 cm, but the combined area is a full circle, so area is 100\u03c0. So the remaining area is 400 - 100\u03c0 = 85.84, which is not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two semicircles are drawn such that their combined area is a full circle with diameter 20 cm. But that would still be 100\u03c0.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the square's side is 20 cm, and the semicircles are drawn on each of two opposite sides, but the semicircles are drawn inward, creating a shape like a square with two half-circles removed from opposite sides. But if they are drawn inward, each semicircle's diameter is 20 cm, so radius 10 cm. So each semicircle's area is 50\u03c0. Two of them, 100\u03c0.\n\nSo remaining area is 400 - 100\u03c0 \u2248 400 - 314.16 = 85.84 cm\u00b2. But the options don't have that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when you cut down the semicircles, you're not removing them from the square's area but using them as part of the remaining structure. But that doesn't make sense for an area calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the two semicircles are drawn on the same side, making a full circle, but that would require the diameter to be 20 cm. So the area would be \u03c0*(10)^2 = 100\u03c0. So if you cut that, the remaining area would be 400 - 100\u03c0, which is about 85.84.\n\nBut again, the options are much smaller. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem setup.\n\nWait, maybe the square is of side length 20 cm, but the semicircles are drawn on the same side, but each with a diameter of 10 cm instead of 20. Because if the square's side is 20 cm, and you have two semicircles on opposite sides, each with diameter 10 cm, then each area is (1/2)*\u03c0*(5)^2 = 12.5\u03c0. Two of them would be 25\u03c0. So remaining area is 400 - 25\u03c0 \u2248 400 - 78.54 = 321.46. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the semicircles have a diameter of 20 cm, but they are not on opposite sides but on adjacent sides, making a shape where each semicircle is on a corner. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the two semicircles are drawn on the same side, but on opposite ends, making a full circle. For example, the top side is 20 cm, and on the left half and right half of the top edge, two semicircles are drawn, each with a diameter of 10 cm. So each semicircle has radius 5 cm. So each area is (1/2)*\u03c0*(5)^2 = 12.5\u03c0. Two of them would be 25\u03c0. So remaining area is 400 - 25\u03c0 \u2248 400 - 78.54 = 321.46 cm\u00b2. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the same side but with a combined diameter of 20 cm. So each is 10 cm diameter. So each semicircle has radius 5 cm. So each area is (1/2)*\u03c0*(5)^2 = 12.5\u03c0. Two of them would be 25\u03c0. So subtracting 25\u03c0 from 400 gives 400 - 78.54 \u2248 321.46, which is still not matching.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the options. The options are all around 8.7. So 8.7 is approximately 28/3, but that's probably not relevant.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the square's edges, but the square's side is 20 cm, and the semicircles have diameter equal to the side, but they are drawn on each corner, so each semicircle is quarter-circle? No, that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the square is folded, and the semicircles are on the outside, but that's more of a 3D consideration, which the problem doesn't suggest.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in metric units, but the options are in different units. But the question states all in cm, so I don't think that's the case.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the area remaining is 8.7 cm\u00b2. So 400 - area of semicircles = 8.7.\n\nSo area of semicircles is 400 - 8.7 = 391.3.\n\nEach semicircle is (1/2)*\u03c0*r\u00b2. Two semicircles: \u03c0*r\u00b2 = 391.3.\n\nSo r squared is 391.3 / \u03c0 \u2248 124.5.\n\nr \u2248 sqrt(124.5) \u2248 11.16 cm. So diameter is about 22.32 cm. But the square's side is 20 cm, so that's impossible. So this can't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the square's area is 100 cm\u00b2 (so each side 10 cm), but the problem says each side is 20 cm. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think about the possible calculation.\n\nWait, what if the two semicircles are cut out from the square, but the area of the remaining paper is the area of the square minus the area of the two semicircles. So square area is 20x20=400. Each semicircle area is (1/2)*\u03c0*(10)^2 = 50\u03c0. Two of them:100\u03c0.\n\n400 - 100\u03c0 = approx 400 - 314.16 =85.84 cm\u00b2. But options are way less.\n\nWait, perhaps the square is actually a different shape. Oh, wait, the paper is in a square form. So maybe it's a square sheet, but when the semicircles are cut, perhaps the remaining area is the area of the square minus the two semicircles.\n\nWait, but that's what I thought earlier. So the area is 85.84, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is about the area of the two semicircles, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the square is 20 cm in perimeter, making each side 5 cm. So area is 25 cm\u00b2. So if the semicircles are on opposite sides, each with diameter 5 cm, radius 2.5 cm. Each semicircle area is (1/2)*\u03c0*(2.5)^2 = (1/2)*\u03c0*6.25 =3.125\u03c0. Two semicircles: 6.25\u03c0. So remaining area is 25 -6.25\u03c0 \u224825 -19.635=5.365 cm\u00b2. But that's not matching the options either.\n\nWait, but the options are 8.7 something, which is about 8.72. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the square's side is 20 cm, but the semicircles are drawn on the diagonals. No, that's not what the problem says.\n\nWait, perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the sides, but each has a diameter equal to half the side length. Wait, but that would be 10 cm. So each semicircle area is (1/2)*\u03c0*(5)^2 =12.5\u03c0. Two of them:25\u03c0. So remaining area is 400-25\u03c0 \u2248400-78.54=321.46, which is still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the semicircles are drawn on adjacent sides, each with a diameter of 20 cm, but that would create a circle in the corner. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the semicircles are drawn with the diameter as the diagonal of the square. The diagonal of a square with side 20 cm is 20*sqrt(2) cm. So the radius would be 10*sqrt(2) cm. Area of each semicircle would be (1/2)*\u03c0*(10\u221a2)^2 = (1/2)*\u03c0*(200)=100\u03c0. Two semicircles:200\u03c0. So remaining area is 400 -200\u03c0 \u2248400-628.32= -228.32 cm\u00b2, which is impossible because area can't be negative. So that's not possible.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and the square's side is 20 units, but the semicircles have a diameter of 20 units. So the area of each semicircle is 50\u03c0. So two semicircles:100\u03c0. So remaining area is 400-100\u03c0. 100\u03c0 is about 314.16, so 400-314.16=85.84 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in reading the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?\"\n\nWait, could it be that the square's side is 20 cm, but the semicircles are drawn on the same side, like on both ends? So, the diameter for each semicircle is 20 cm, but each is drawn on opposite ends of the same side.\n\nWait, but that would mean each semicircle has a diameter of 20 cm, so radius 10 cm. But if the square's side is 20 cm, and you draw a semicircle on each end, their areas would overlap beyond the square.\n\nWait, perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the same side, each with diameter 20 cm, but that would require the semicircles to be drawn outside the square, which wouldn't affect the remaining area when cut.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two semicircles are drawn on the same side, each with diameter 20 cm, but overlapping. So each has an area of 50\u03c0, but combined, they're 100\u03c0, but overlapping... No, that's getting too complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the two semicircles are drawn on the same side, each with diameter 10 cm. So each semicircle has a radius of 5 cm. So each area is (1/2)*\u03c0*(5)^2=12.5\u03c0. Two of them:25\u03c0. So remaining area is 400 -25\u03c0\u2248400-78.54=321.46 cm\u00b2. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the square is made up of two semicircles and a rectangle. But that's probably not relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the remaining paper is the area of the square minus the area of the two semicircles, which together make a circle. So the area is 400 - 100\u03c0. So 400 = 400, 100\u03c0\u2248314.16, 400-314.16=85.84 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut the options are around 8.7. So perhaps the square's side is 20\u221a(\u03c0) or something, but that's not stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the square is of area 20 cm\u00b2, but that would make each side about 4.47 cm.\n\nWait, perhaps the semicircles are not on the sides but on the corners. So each semicircle is on a corner, with the diameter being the side of the square. So each semicircle has a diameter of 20 cm, radius 10 cm. But four corners, not two. Hmm, but the problem says two semicircles.\n\nWait, I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should proceed with the calculation I have and see if any of the options are close, but they're not.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the semicircles are on opposite sides, but the area to subtract is their area, but perhaps the semicircles are only on one side, so instead of two, it's one.\n\nWait, no, the problem says two semicircles.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Maybe I need to check the options given. The options are A)8.75, B)8.79, C)8.75, D)8.71, E)8.72. So all around 8.7. So perhaps the area is 8.7 cm\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps the area remaining is the area of the two semicircles, which would be 100\u03c0, but that's 314 cm\u00b2, which isn't matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the area remaining is the sum of the square and the two semicircles. No, that would be larger.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem involves the perimeter. Let me calculate the perimeter of the square: 4*20=80 cm. But the options are about 8.7, which isn't related.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the semicircles are on opposite corners, each with diameter equal to the diagonal of the square. The diagonal is 20\u221a2 cm. So radius is 10\u221a2 cm. So each semicircle area is (1/2)*\u03c0*(10\u221a2)^2 = (1/2)*\u03c0*(200)=100\u03c0. Two semicircles:200\u03c0. So remaining area is 400 - 200\u03c0\u2248400-628.32= -228.32 cm\u00b2. That's impossible, so that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the midpoints of opposite sides, making their diameter 20 cm. So each semicircle is 50\u03c0. Two of them:100\u03c0. Remaining area 400 -100\u03c0\u224885.84 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut again, the options don't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the semicircles are not on the edges but on the corners, each with diameter 10 cm. So radius 5 cm. Each semicircle area is 12.5\u03c0. Two of them:25\u03c0. Remaining area:400 -25\u03c0\u2248400-78.54=321.46 cm\u00b2.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nWait, maybe it's a typo, and the square's side is 2 cm instead of 20 cm. Let's try that. So area is 4 cm\u00b2. Each semicircle has diameter 2 cm, radius 1 cm. Area each semicircle:0.5 * \u03c0 * 1^2=0.5\u03c0. Two of them:\u03c0. So remaining area=4-\u03c0\u22484-3.14=0.86 cm\u00b2. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, maybe the square is 20 cm in area. So side is sqrt(20)=approx 4.47 cm. So semicircles have diameter 4.47 cm, radius 2.235 cm. Area each:0.5 * \u03c0*(2.235)^2\u22480.5 * \u03c0 *5\u22487.85. Two semicircles:15.7. So remaining area=20-15.7\u22484.3 cm\u00b2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the square's area is 20 cm\u00b2, but the problem says side is 20 cm. So that's not it.\n\nI think I'm missing something in the problem statement. Let me read it again.\n\n\"A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?\"\n\nWait, could the \"opposites\" refer to the same side, meaning the two ends of that side? So, one semicircle on each end of the same side.\n\nSo, if the square's side is 20 cm, and on one side, two semicircles are drawn on each end, each with a diameter of 10 cm (since the side is 20 cm, so each semicircle's diameter is 10 cm). So each semicircle has radius 5 cm. Area of each is 0.5 * \u03c0 *5\u00b2=12.5\u03c0. Two of them:25\u03c0. So remaining area is 400 -25\u03c0\u2248400-78.54=321.46 cm\u00b2. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the same side, but their combined diameter is 20 cm, meaning each has a diameter of 10 cm. So each has radius 5 cm. So area each is 12.5\u03c0. Two of them:25\u03c0. So remaining area is 400-25\u03c0\u2248321.46 cm\u00b2. Still not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the two semicircles are drawn on the same side, but each with a diameter of 20 cm, but that would require the square's side to be longer than 20 cm, which it isn't.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the opposite corners of the square, making their diameter the diagonal of a smaller square within. But that's getting too complicated and not matching the problem statement.\n\nI'm really stuck. Given that none of the calculations I'm doing are matching the options provided, perhaps I should look for another approach.\n\nWait, maybe the remaining area is the area of the square minus the area of the two semicircles, which together make a circle. So the area is 400 -100\u03c0. Let me compute that numerically.\n\n100\u03c0 is approximately 314.159.\n\n400 - 314.159 \u224885.841 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the same side, not on opposite sides. So, for example, on the top side, two semicircles are drawn, each with a diameter of 10 cm. So each has radius 5 cm. Area each is 12.5\u03c0. Two of them:25\u03c0. Remaining area:400-25\u03c0\u2248321.46 cm\u00b2. Not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the two semicircles are drawn on the same side, each with a diameter of 20 cm. That can't be, as it would require their centers to be 20 cm apart, but the side is 20 cm. So each semicircle would be overlapping beyond the square.\n\nI'm going in circles. Perhaps I should consider that the problem is a trick question, and the remaining area is the area of the square minus the area of the two semicircles, leading to 400 -100\u03c0 \u224885.84, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the closest option isn't either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem involves the area of the overlapping regions. But that's getting too complex.\n\nWait, perhaps the two semicircles are drawn on the same side, each with diameter 20 cm, but arranged such that their centers are at opposite ends of the side. So each semicircle would have a radius of 10 cm and would extend beyond the square. But when you cut them, perhaps you're removing the area of the square outside the semicircles. Wait, that would complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the remaining area is the area of the square plus the area of the two semicircles. But that would be 400 + 100\u03c0 \u2248714.16 cm\u00b2, which is not an option.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the square's corners, each with diameter equal to the side. So each semicircle has diameter 20 cm, radius 10 cm. But each corner can only support a quarter-circle, not a semicircle. So perhaps the problem is about quarter-circles, not semicircles.\n\nWait, but the problem says semicircles. So perhaps it's a mistake, and they meant quarter-circles.\n\nIf that's the case, each quarter-circle has radius 10 cm. So area each is (1/4)*\u03c0*(10)^2=25\u03c0. Two of them:50\u03c0. So remaining area is 400 -50\u03c0\u2248400-157.08=242.92 cm\u00b2. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps only one quarter-circle is involved. So 25\u03c0 area subtracted from 400, giving 400-25\u03c0\u2248400-78.54=321.46 cm\u00b2. Still not matching.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Given that, perhaps I should consider that the problem is written wrong, or I'm missing a key point. Alternatively, perhaps the remaining area is the area of the two semicircles, but that would be 100\u03c0\u2248314 cm\u00b2, which is not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the square's side is 20 cm, and the semicircles are drawn with the side as the radius, not the diameter. So radius 20 cm. So area each semicircle is (1/2)*\u03c0*(20)^2=200\u03c0. Two semicircles:400\u03c0\u22481256.64 cm\u00b2. Which is impossible as it's larger than the square's area.\n\nNo, that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the square's perimeter, but only a part of them is within the square. So when you cut them down, you're removing the part inside the square. But that complicates the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the same side, but the area being subtracted is the overlapping region.\n\nI think I'm stuck and perhaps should proceed with the initial calculation, even though it doesn't match the options.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that I'm using the wrong value for \u03c0. Perhaps in the options, they're using \u03c0=22/7. Let me try that.\n\nSo 100\u03c0 \u2248100*(22/7)= 314.2857 cm\u00b2.\n\n400 -314.2857=85.7143 cm\u00b2. Still not matching the options.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the two semicircles are drawn on the same side, each with a diameter of 20 cm, but positioned such that the total area removed is that of a circle with radius 20 cm. But that would give an area removed of \u03c0*(20)^2=400\u03c0, which is way larger than the square's area.\n\nWait another approach: perhaps the area remaining is the area of the square plus the area of the two semicircles, but that would be larger than 400, so no.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about the circumference, but the area is 8.7. But that doesn't connect.\n\nI'm really stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I have to choose the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the two semicircles are on opposite sides, each with diameter 20 cm, and when cut, you're left with a shape that has a remaining area of 8.7 cm\u00b2. But that would mean that the area of the two semicircles is 400 -8.7=391.3 cm\u00b2. But two semicircles with area 391.3 would be a circle with area 391.3, radius sqrt(391.3/\u03c0)\u2248sqrt(124.5)\u224811.16 cm. So diameter would be 22.32 cm, which is longer than the square's side of 20 cm. Impossible.\n\nSo that can't be.\n\nI think I must have made a miscalculation in the problem setup. Let me try to find another perspective.\n\nWait, perhaps the square is of area 20 cm\u00b2, but each side is sqrt(20)=approx 4.47 cm. Then, two semicircles, each with diameter 4.47 cm, radius 2.235 cm. Area each is 0.5 * \u03c0 * (2.235)^2\u22480.5*\u03c0*5\u22487.85. Two of them:15.7. So remaining area=20-15.7=4.3 cm\u00b2. Not matching options.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the two semicircles are drawn on the same side, each with a diameter of 10 cm. So radius 5 cm. Each has area 0.5 * \u03c0 *5\u00b2=12.5\u03c0. Two of them:25\u03c0\u224878.54. Remaining area is 400-78.54\u2248321.46 cm\u00b2.\n\nNot matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the same side, each with a diameter of 20 cm, but the square's side is 20 cm, so the semicircles are drawn inward, making a sort of lens shape. But the area would still be 100\u03c0, which is 314.16. Remaining area 85.84.\n\nWait, perhaps the remaining area is the area of the square minus the area of the two semicircles, which together make a circle, so 400-100\u03c0=85.84 cm\u00b2. But none of the options match this. So perhaps the problem is written incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the square's side is 20 cm, and the semicircles are drawn on the same side, each with diameter 10 cm. So two semicircles of radius 5 cm, area each 12.5\u03c0. Two of them:25\u03c0\u224878.54. Remaining area=400-78.54\u2248321.46 cm\u00b2.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm miscalculating the area to subtract. Maybe the two semicircles are drawn on the same side, but their combined area is a full circle with radius 10 cm. So area is \u03c0*(10)^2=100\u03c0. So remaining area=400-100\u03c0=85.84 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut again, the options are around 8.7. So perhaps the problem is mistakenly written, or I'm miscalculating.\n\nGiven that, I think I have to go with the initial conclusion that the remaining area is 400 -100\u03c0\u224885.84 cm\u00b2. But since none of the options match, perhaps the closest is not present, but perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the square's area is 20 cm\u00b2, but the problem says each side is 20 cm, which can't be. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the semicircles are drawn on the square's perimeter, but only the area within the square is subtracted. So for each semicircle, the area within the square is a quarter-circle. So each semicircle contributes a quarter-circle area.\n\nWait, but that would mean each semicircle's area subtracted is (1/4)*\u03c0*r\u00b2. So with r=10 cm, each would subtract (1/4)*\u03c0*100=25\u03c0. Two of them:50\u03c0. So remaining area=400-50\u03c0\u2248400-157.08\u2248242.92 cm\u00b2. Still not matching.\n\nWait, I'm giving up. I think I've tried all possible approaches, and none match the options provided. Perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is 8.75 or similar, but I'm not sure how to reach it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a typo, and the square's side is 2 cm, making area 4 cm\u00b2. Then, semicircles with diameter 2 cm, radius 1 cm. Each area 0.5*\u03c0*(1)^2=1.57 cm\u00b2. Two of them:3.14. Remaining area=4-3.14=0.86 cm\u00b2. Not matching options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the square's side is 20 cm, and the semicircles are on adjacent sides, each with diameter 20 cm. So each has radius 10 cm. Area each semicircle:50\u03c0. Two of them:100\u03c0. Remaining area=400-100\u03c0\u224885.84 cm\u00b2.\n\nI think the intended answer is 85.84, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the area remaining is the area of the square minus the area of the two semicircles, which is 400 -100\u03c0. 100\u03c0 is approximately 314.16. 400-314.16=85.84 cm\u00b2. None of the options match this. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but I have to choose the closest option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the two semicircles are not on opposite sides but on adjacent sides. So each has radius 10 cm. But when you cut them, the area removed is the overlapping area. But calculating overlapping areas is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area removed is the area of the two semicircles minus their overlapping area. But without knowing the exact positions, this is hard to compute.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possibilities. The only conclusion I can reach is that the problem's options are incorrect or I'm missing a key detail.\n\n\nThe problem involves a square with a side length of 20 cm, on which two semicircles are drawn on opposite sides, each with the side of the square as its diameter. The task is to determine the area of the remaining paper after these semicircles are cut out.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Square Area**: The area of the square is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of square} = \\text{side}^2 = 20^2 = 400 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Semicircle Area**: Each semicircle has a diameter of 20 cm, so the radius is \\( r = \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\, \\text{cm} \\). The area of one semicircle is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of one semicircle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi r^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi (10)^2 = 50\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^2\n   \\]\n   Since there are two semicircles, the total area removed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total area of two semicircles} = 2 \\times 50\\pi = 100\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Remaining Area**: The remaining area after cutting out the two semicircles is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining area} = \\text{Area of square} - \\text{Total area of two semicircles}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining area} = 400 - 100\\pi\n   \\]\n   Using \\( \\pi \\approx 3.1416 \\):\n   \\[\n   100\\pi \\approx 314.16 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{Remaining area} \\approx 400 - 314.16 = 85.84 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Mismatch with Options**: The calculated remaining area (\\( \\approx 85.84 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\)) does not match any of the provided options, which are all around 8.7. This suggests either an error in the problem setup, a misinterpretation of the question, or incorrect options.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter extensive analysis, the calculated remaining area is \\( 400 - 100\\pi \\approx 85.84 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\). However, since none of the options match this value, it is likely that the problem contains an error or the options are incorrect. Given the provided options, none are valid based on the given problem.\n\n**Answer: None of the options are correct.**",
