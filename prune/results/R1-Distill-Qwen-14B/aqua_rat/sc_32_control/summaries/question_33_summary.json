      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a rectangular sheet of paper. When it's folded into two equal halves, it has different perimeters depending on which sides it's folded along. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.\n\nLet me read the question again to make sure I get the details right. So when the sheet is folded along one set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. And when it's folded along the other set, the perimeter for each part is 66 cm. I need to find the area of the original sheet.\n\nWait, right. So the sheet is rectangular, which means it has two different dimensions: length and width. Let's say the original rectangle has a length L and a width W.\n\nWhen you fold it into two equal halves, you're either folding along the length or along the width. So, when you fold along one set of sides, say the length, you're essentially dividing the width into two parts. Wait, no, let me think again. If you have a rectangle and you fold it along its length, then each half would have the same dimensions as the original, but half the width? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it as cutting the sheet into two smaller rectangles. If you fold along the length, you'll be cutting it into two smaller sheets each of size (L/2) by W. Alternatively, if you fold along the width, each part will be (W/2) by L.\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Wait, no. Folding along the length would halve the width, because you're bringing the two ends of the length together. So the sheet is folded along its length, so the new dimensions would be L by (W/2). But wait, each half would then have a perimeter based on their new dimensions.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's clarify. When you fold a rectangle along its length, you're making a crease along the length, so the width is halved. So each of the two resulting parts would have dimensions L and (W/2). Because imagine the rectangle is L long and W wide. Folding it along the length would mean each half has width W/2 and length L.\n\nSimilarly, if you fold along the width, each half would have length L/2 and width W.\n\nWait, wait, I think I'm getting this mixed up. Let me sketch a quick mental picture. If I have a rectangle, length L, width W. If I fold it along the length, which is the longer side, I'm folding along the middle of the length, right? So each part would be L/2 in length and W in width. No, wait, no, that's not right. Because when you fold along the length, you are bringing the two ends of the length together, effectively halving the width. So each part would have dimensions L (same length) and W/2 (half the width). Because the width is the shorter side, so when you fold along the length, the width gets halved.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the sides. The original rectangle has two lengths (each of length L) and two widths (each of W). When folded along the length, the new sheet is folded along the middle of the length, so each half is L/2 by W. Or wait, no. Wait, when you fold a rectangle along its length, you are bringing the two longer sides together. So the dimension that's halved would be the width.\n\nWait, perhaps I should assign variables to the original dimensions. Let me let the original rectangle have length L and width W. When folded along the length, each half will have a perimeter of 48 cm. Alternatively, when folded along the width, each half has a perimeter of 66 cm.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, when you fold along one set of sides, you're halving one of the dimensions. So for example, if you fold along the length (i.e., along the longer side), then each half would have dimensions (L/2) by W. Or is it L by (W/2)? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from what exactly is being folded. Let me think differently. When you fold a rectangle into two equal parts along one side, you cut the other dimension in half.\n\nSo, if the original dimensions are L and W, and you fold along the length (i.e., you fold along the side that's L in length), then each resulting part would have dimensions (W/2) and L? Or is it L and (W/2)?\n\nWait, no. Let me think of it physically. Imagine holding a sheet of paper that's longer in length (L) than in width (W). If you fold it along its length, you're bringing the two ends of the length together, which would effectively halve the width. So each part would have length L and width W/2.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So each part when folded along the length would be L by (W/2). Similarly, when you fold along the width, each part would be (L/2) by W.\n\nSo, for each case, the perimeters are given. When folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. When folded along the width, each part has a perimeter of 66 cm.\n\nWait, but wait, the perimeter when folded along the length is 48 cm. Each half is L by (W/2). So the perimeter of each part would be 2*(L + (W/2)) = 2L + W.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, each half is (L/2) by W. So the perimeter is 2*((L/2) + W) = L + 2W.\n\nSo let me write the equations:\n\nCase 1: Folded along length. So perimeter is 2L + W = 48 cm.\n\nCase 2: Folded along width. So perimeter is L + 2W = 66 cm.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) 2L + W = 48\n\n2) L + 2W = 66\n\nI need to solve for L and W.\n\nHmm, okay, let's write these equations down.\n\nEquation 1: 2L + W = 48\n\nEquation 2: L + 2W = 66\n\nI can solve this system of equations. Let's use substitution or elimination.\n\nLet me use elimination. Let's multiply Equation 1 by 2 so that the coefficients of W will be same.\n\nEquation 1 multiplied by 2: 4L + 2W = 96\n\nEquation 2: L + 2W = 66\n\nNow subtract Equation 2 from this new equation.\n\n(4L +2W) - (L +2W) = 96 -66\n\nWhich is 3L = 30 \u2192 L=10.\n\nNow plug L=10 into Equation 1: 2*(10) + W =48 \u2192 20 + W =48 \u2192 W=28.\n\nSo L=10 cm, W=28 cm.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me check: If L is 10 and W is 28, then when folded along length (so each part is L by W/2 \u2192 10 x14), the perimeter is 2*(10+14)=2*24=48. Correct.\n\nWhen folded along width, each part is (L/2) x W \u2192 5 x 28. The perimeter is 2*(5+28)=2*33=66. Correct.\n\nSo the original dimensions are L=10, W=28. So the area is L*W=10*28=280. Wait, but looking at the options, none of them is 280. Wait, what's wrong here.\n\nWait, the options are A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200.\n\nWait, 280 is not among them. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nHmm, perhaps I mixed up the way the folding is done. Let me re-examine the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the perimeters wrong. Let me think again: when you fold along the length, each part has dimensions L and W/2. So the perimeter is 2*(L + W/2). Similarly, when folded along the width, each part is L/2 and W, so perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I have the perimeters the other way around. Because maybe when folded along the length, the perimeter is larger. Because if L is longer, then when you fold along W, the new dimension is smaller.\n\nWait, let me re-express the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says that when folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, the perimeter is 48 cm. When folded along the other set, the perimeter is 66 cm.\n\nSo which set of sides gives which perimeter? Let me think: when you fold along the longer side, you end up with a larger perimeter? Or when you fold along the shorter side.\n\nWait, perhaps I should assume that when folded along the longer side, each part has a larger perimeter. Because when you fold along the length (long side), you're not changing the length, but halving the width. So if the original width is smaller, halving it would make each part's width even smaller, perhaps leading to a smaller perimeter?\n\nWait, perhaps I had the equations reversed. Let me try that.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me assume that when you fold along the length, the perimeter is 66, and when folded along the width, it's 48.\n\nWait, maybe I mixed up the perimeters. Let's try that.\n\nSo if the original rectangle has length L and width W.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each part is L \u00d7 (W/2). So perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W. This equals 66.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is (L/2) \u00d7 W. Perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W. This equals 48.\n\nSo now, the equations would be:\n\n1) 2L + W =66\n\n2) L + 2W =48\n\nLet me solve this.\n\nMultiply equation 2 by 2: 2L +4W =96\n\nSubtract equation 1: (2L +4W) - (2L +W) )=96 -66 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nThen plug W=10 into equation 2: L + 2*10=48 \u2192 L=28.\n\nSo L=28, W=10.\n\nSo the area is L\u00d7W=28\u00d710=280. Still 280. Not matching the options.\n\nHmm, but the options are way bigger. So I must have a mistake in my setup.\n\nWait a second. Maybe the perimeters are for the folded sheet, but perhaps each half is treated as a single sheet after folding, but perhaps I'm missing that the folded sheet's perimeter includes both the original and folded edges.\n\nWait, wait, when you fold a sheet into two, each part is a smaller rectangle. So when folded along the length, each part is L \u00d7 (W/2). The perimeter of that part would be 2*(L + W/2).\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that when you fold a sheet, the total perimeter is that of the folded part, which includes the folded edge. But I think that's already accounted for in my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you fold the sheet, the length or width is the same, but the other dimension is halved. So perhaps when you fold along the length, each part has dimensions (L/2) \u00d7 W. Or maybe I'm thinking about it wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the sheet as being folded along its length, which would make each part have a dimension of (W \u00d7 (L/2)). Hmm, no, that's not right. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the original sheet is folded along one of its longer sides, which would create two smaller rectangles, each with dimensions that are half the original length. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, let me take an example. Suppose the original sheet is L by W. If I fold it along the length, I'm bringing the two ends of the length together, so the resulting sheet after folding is W by (L/2). Because the length is now halved but the width remains the same.\n\nWait, that would make the dimensions W and (L/2). So the perimeter would be 2*(W + L/2) = 2W + L.\n\nAlternatively, if I fold along the width, the resulting sheet would have dimensions L and (W/2), so the perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W.\n\nBut the problem states that when folded along one set of sides, the perimeter is 48 cm, and along the other, it's 66 cm.\n\nSo perhaps the way I set up the equations was incorrect earlier.\n\nLet me define the variables again. Let me call the original sheet's length as A and width as B.\n\nWhen folded along the length (i.e., along the A side), each part is B by (A/2). The perimeter is 2*(B + A/2) = 2B + A.\n\nWhen folded along the width (i.e., along the B side), each part is (B/2) by A. The perimeter is 2*(A + B/2) = 2A + B.\n\nSo the two equations are:\n\nCase 1: 2B + A = 48\n\nCase 2: 2A + B =66\n\nNow, let's solve these equations.\n\nEquation 1: A + 2B =48\n\nEquation 2: 2A + B =66\n\nLet's use elimination. Multiply equation 1 by 2:\n\n2A +4B =96\n\nEquation 2: 2A + B =66\n\nSubtract equation 2 from this:\n\n(2A +4B) - (2A +B) )=96-66 \u2192 3B =30 \u2192 B=10.\n\nSubstituting B=10 into equation 1: A + 2*10=48 \u2192 A=28.\n\nSo the original sheet is A=28 cm, B=10 cm. Area is 28*10=280 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut looking at the options, none is 280. So I must have made a mistake here. Because the options are much larger. So maybe I swapped the perimeters.\n\nWait, perhaps when folding along the length, the perimeter is 66, and when along the width, it's 48.\n\nLet me try that. So equations would be:\n\nEquation 1: 2B + A =66 (folded along length)\n\nEquation 2: 2A + B =48 (folded along width)\n\nSolving these:\n\nEquation 1: A +2B =66\n\nEquation 2: 2A + B =48\n\nLet me multiply equation 1 by 2: 2A +4B=132\n\nEquation 2: 2A + B=48\n\nSubtract equation 2 from the first:\n\n(2A +4B) - (2A + B) ) = 132 -48 \u2192 3B=84 \u2192 B=28.\n\nThen plug into equation 2: 2A +28=48 \u21922A=20 \u2192 A=10.\n\nSo original sheet is A=10, B=28. Area=10*28=280 cm\u00b2. Still the same problem.\n\nWait, but the options are in hundreds or thousands. 280 is way smaller. So I must have made a wrong assumption about the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded into two equal parts, but each part is a square, but that seems unlikely because the perimeters are different. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I got the perimeter setup wrong. Let me think again. When you fold along the length, you have a sheet that's B by (A/2). So perimeter is 2*(B + A/2) = 2B + A.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, it's 2*(A + B/2) = 2A + B.\n\nIn the problem, when folded along one set, the perimeter is 48, and along the other, 66.\n\nSo perhaps I should set up the equations as:\n\n2B + A =48\n\n2A + B=66\n\nWait, that's what I did earlier, leading to A=28, B=10, area=280.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a minute. Maybe the perimeter given is the sum for both parts, not each part.\n\nWait, the question says: 'perimeter of 48cm for each part'. Oh no, wait, no\u2014the wording is: 'a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides.'\n\nWait, the wording is a bit unclear. Does 'each part' refer to each of the two parts being 48 cm, or the total?\n\nWait, the problem says when folded into two equal halves, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm when folded along one set of sides, and 66 cm when folded along the other.\n\nSo each part has a perimeter of 48 when folded along one way, and 66 when folded along the other.\n\nSo each part's perimeter is 48 or 66, depending on the fold.\n\nSo my initial setup was correct, but the area is 280, which is not in the options.\n\nSo perhaps I made a mistake in the way I model the problem.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the sheet is folded along the length, so the resulting sheet has dimensions A and B/2, but in this case, the perimeter is for the entire folded sheet, which is two parts. Wait, no, because when you fold it, you have two parts, each with their own perimeter.\n\nWait, but the problem says 'each part' has a perimeter. So each of the two parts, when folded along one set of sides, has a perimeter of 48, and when folded along the other set, each part has a perimeter of 66.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, each with a certain perimeter. So perhaps when folded along one side, each part is a rectangle with perimeter 48, and when folded along the other, each part has 66.\n\nSo, but in that case, the original sheet would be twice the size of the folded parts.\n\nWait, no, because when you fold it, each part is half the area of the original.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me denote the original dimensions as length L and width W.\n\nWhen the sheet is folded along the length, each part has dimensions L/2 and W. So each part's perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = (L + 2W).\n\nWait, so if that's 48, then equation 1 is L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part has dimensions L and W/2. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W.\n\nSo equation 2 is 2L + W =66.\n\nNow I have:\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W =48\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W =66\n\nLet me solve these.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2: 2L +4W =96.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W =66.\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n(2L +4W) - (2L + W) )= 96-66 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nSubstitute W=10 into equation 1: L +20=48 \u2192 L=28.\n\nSo L=28, W=10.\n\nArea is 28*10=280. Again, same result. But the options don't include 280. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.\n\nWait, what if the perimeters are for both parts together? Like, when folded along one side, both parts combined have a perimeter of 48, but that would not make much sense, because each part would have its own perimeter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the perimeters. Let me check with L=28, W=10.\n\nCase 1: Folded along length, so each part is L/2=14 and W=10. Perimeter: 2*(14+10)=2*24=48. Correct.\n\nCase 2: Folded along width, each part is L=28 and W/2=5. Perimeter: 2*(28+5)=2*33=66. Correct.\n\nSo the area is 28*10=280 cm\u00b2, but none of the options match. So perhaps the problem is in the way I'm interpreting the folding direction.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded along its length, but the resulting part is a rectangle of (L \u00d7 W/2), but perhaps the perimeter is calculated as 2*(L + W/2), which is correct.\n\nSo perhaps the mistake is that I'm using cm instead of another unit, but the options are in numbers without units, so probably not.\n\nWait, perhaps the original sheet is folded into four parts? No, the question says two equal halves.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the entire sheet's perimeter after folding, but no, the question says each part has a perimeter of 48 or 66.\n\nWait, maybe the sheet is folded along the length, but the resulting part's perimeter is for the folded part, which includes the crease. Or perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sheet is folded along its length, making a crease down the middle, and the perimeter is calculated as the sum of all four sides of each part. But each part is a smaller rectangle.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is between the perimeter of one part and the sum for both parts.\n\nWait, the question says: when folded into two equal halves, each part has a perimeter of 48. So each part is a rectangle, and each has perimeter 48.\n\nSo no, I think my approach is correct. So unless I've made a calculation mistake, perhaps there's an error in the options.\n\nWait, but let's check the options again. The options are all in three or four digits, but 280 is in three digits. Oh wait, the options are:\n\nA)1584\n\nB)1120\n\nC)792\n\nD)1320\n\nE)1200\n\nHmm. 280 isn't among them. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption about which dimension is being halved.\n\nWait, perhaps when the sheet is folded along the length, the length is halved, not the width. Let me try that.\n\nSo, if I fold along the length, each part is (L/2) \u00d7 W. Perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W.\n\nIf this is 48, then equation 1: L + 2W =48\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is L \u00d7 (W/2). Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W.\n\nIf this is 66, equation 2: 2L + W=66\n\nNow, solving:\n\nEquation 1: L +2W=48\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W=66\n\nLet me multiply equation 1 by 2: 2L +4W=96\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W=66\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n(2L +4W) - (2L +W) )=96-66 \u21923W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nSubstitute into equation 1: L +20=48 \u2192 L=28.\n\nSo area is 28*10=280. Again, same problem.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider that when folding along the length, the resulting sheet is L \u00d7 W/2, so perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=48.\n\nAnd when folded along the width, each part is L/2 \u00d7 W, perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W)= L + 2W=66.\n\nSo equations:\n\nEquation 1: 2L + W =48\n\nEquation 2: L +2W=66\n\nNow solving:\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2: 4L +2W=96\n\nEquation 2: L +2W=66\n\nSubtract equation2 from equation1:\n\n3L=30 \u2192 L=10.\n\nSubstitute into equation2: 10 +2W=66 \u21922W=56 \u2192 W=28.\n\nSo L=10, W=28. Area=10\u00d728=280. Same result.\n\nSo I'm getting 280, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 3 or something.\n\nWait, maybe I should think that when you fold the sheet into two parts, each part has a perimeter of 48, but the original sheet has a perimeter that's more than that.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters given are for the entire folded sheet, which is two parts. But that doesn't make much sense, because the perimeter of each part is given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded such that the perimeter of the folded sheet (each part) is 48 cm. But each part is a rectangle, so their perimeters are 48 and 66.\n\nWait, perhaps the original sheet's area is four times that of each part. Because each part is half the area. So if each part is L/2 \u00d7 W, then the original area is (L/2 \u00d7 W)*2 = L*W.\n\nHmm, that doesn't change anything. So perhaps the problem is that the original sheet, when folded along one side, each half has a perimeter of 48, and when folded along the other, each has 66.\n\nWait, but according to the calculations, the area is 280 cm\u00b2, which is not an option. So I must have a wrong approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the perimeters given are for the folded sheet as a whole, not each part. But the question says each part.\n\nWait, maybe the sheet is folded into two equal parts, and the perimeters given are for the two parts together. But that doesn't make much sense because each part is a separate rectangle.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the way I'm interpreting the folding direction. Maybe when folded along the length, the resulting sheet's length is W and the width is L/2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should assign variables differently.\n\nLet me let the original sheet have sides x and y. When folded along the x side, each part has dimensions x/2 and y. Perimeter is 2*(x/2 + y) = x + 2y =48.\n\nWhen folded along the y side, each part has dimensions x and y/2. Perimeter is 2*(x + y/2) = 2x + y=66.\n\nSo the same equations as before: x+2y=48 and 2x+y=66.\n\nSolving:\n\nMultiply first equation by 2: 2x +4y=96.\n\nSecond equation: 2x + y=66.\n\nSubtract second equation from first:\n\n3y=30 \u2192 y=10.\n\nThen x=48-2*10=28.\n\nSo x=28, y=10. Area=28*10=280.\n\nSame result again. So perhaps the options are wrong, or I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, but the perimeters include the folded edge. So when you fold a sheet, the folded edge is internal, so perhaps the perimeter doesn't include that edge.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. Because when you fold the sheet, the edge where you fold becomes internal, so each part would have three sides contributing to the perimeter, plus the folded edge, which is not part of the perimeter.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, when you fold a sheet into two parts along one edge, each part is a rectangle, but the folded edge is internal, so it's not part of the perimeter. So each part would have three sides plus the folded edge, which is half the length of the original sheet.\n\nWait, this complicates things a bit. Let me try to model it.\n\nSuppose the original sheet is of dimensions L and W.\n\nCase 1: Folded along the length (L). So each part is L/2 by W. But the folded edge is along the L/2 side, making the perimeter for each part consist of two sides of W and one side of L/2.\n\nWait, no, because when you fold it, the two parts are connected along the L/2 edge, so each part has a perimeter that includes the other three sides.\n\nWait, perhaps when you fold along the length, each part is a rectangle of (L/2) by W, but the folded edge is internal, so the perimeter of each part is 2*W + L/2.\n\nWait, but that would change the perimeters.\n\nSo for case 1, when folded along L: perimeter is 2W + (L/2) =48.\n\nCase 2: Folded along W: perimeter is 2L + (W/2)=66.\n\nWait, let's write the equations:\n\nEquation 1: 2W + (L/2) =48 \u2192 multiply by 2: 4W + L =96.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + (W/2)=66 \u2192 multiply by 2:4L + W=132.\n\nNow, the system is:\n\n4W + L =96 \u2192 equation A.\n\n4L + W=132 \u2192 equation B.\n\nLet me solve for L and W.\n\nFrom equation A: L=96-4W.\n\nSubstitute into equation B: 4*(96-4W) + W =132 \u2192 384 -16W + W =132 \u2192 384 -15W=132 \u2192 -15W= -252 \u2192 W=17. (since 252/15=17. Let me calculate 15*17=255, no, 15*17=255, which is not 252. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, 4*(96) is 384.\n\n384 -16W + W =384 -15W=132.\n\n384-132=252 \u2192 252=15W \u2192 W=252/15 =16.8.\n\nHmm, that doesn't give integer values, which is suspicious, but let's proceed.\n\nSo W=16.8 cm.\n\nThen L=96-4*16.8 =96-67.2=28.8 cm.\n\nSo L=28.8, W=16.8.\n\nThen area is 28.8 *16.8 = let's calculate.\n\n28.8 *16.8 \u2192 28 *16 =448, 0.8*16=12.8, 28*0.8=22.4, 0.8*0.8=0.64.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way:\n\n(28 +0.8) * (16 +0.8) = 28*16 +28*0.8 +0.8*16 +0.8*0.8.\n\n=448 +22.4 +12.8 +0.64 =448+22.4=470.4; 470.4+12.8=483.2; 483.2+0.64=483.84 cm\u00b2.\n\nHmm, 483.84 is not matching any of the options either.\n\nMoreover, the problem gives integer options, so this approach might be wrong.\n\nSo perhaps the initial assumption about the perimeter not including the folded edge is incorrect. So going back.\n\nSo I think I must have made a mistake in the initial setup. But according to all possible approaches, I get 280 as the area, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm missing a step.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is not folded along its own sides, but along the middle, so each part's dimensions are different.\n\nWait, but that's what I've been assuming. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sheet is folded into two parts, but when folded along the length, the perimeter includes the folded edge.\n\nWait, perhaps when you fold along the length, each part has a perimeter that includes the length and the half the width, but also the folded edge. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the sheet as a rectangle with length L and width W.\n\nWhen folded along the length, the resulting part has dimensions (L/2) and W. So perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L +2W.\n\nBut perhaps the perimeter includes the folded edge, which adds another L/2. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the folded edge is a new side, so the perimeter becomes L/2 + 2W.\n\nWait, no, that would be if the folded edge is an external edge. But when you fold, the folded edge is internal, so it's not part of the perimeter.\n\nSo I'm back to the same equations.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options and see if any of them could lead to the perimeters given.\n\nThe options are A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200.\n\nHmm, all are multiples of, say, 1200 is 12*100, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the original sheet has dimensions that are 48 and 66 when folded, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when folded along one side, the perimeter is 48, and when folded along the other, it's 66. So the original sheet's perimeter is 48 + 66 =114 cm? No, that's not necessarily the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original sheet's perimeter is 48 +66 =114 cm, but that's just a guess.\n\nWait, but the original sheet's perimeter is 2*(L + W).\n\nSo if I have L=28, W=10, perimeter is 2*(38)=76 cm. Which is not 48 or 66.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think that when folded, the perimeters are 48 and 66, but that the original sheet's perimeters are different.\n\nWait, perhaps the original sheet's perimeter is 48 + 66 =114 cm.\n\nBut that's a guess.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me let the original sheet have L and W.\n\nWhen folded along length, each part is (L/2) \u00d7 W. So perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along width, each part is L \u00d7 (W/2). Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W =66.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n1) L + 2W =48\n\n2) 2L + W =66\n\nLet me solve these equations.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2: 2L +4W=96.\n\nSubtract equation 2: (2L +4W) - (2L +W) )=96-66 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nThen from equation 1: L +20=48 \u2192 L=28.\n\nSo area is 28*10=280.\n\nSo no match with the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters given are for the entire folded sheet, which is two parts. But that would mean each part's perimeter is half that.\n\nWait, but the question says each part has a perimeter. So if the entire folded sheet's perimeter is 48, each part would have half of that, but that doesn't make sense because each part is a separate rectangle.\n\nAlternatively, when folded into two parts, each part has a perimeter of 48, but when you unfold, you get the original sheet.\n\nWait, given that I'm stuck and the options don't match my calculation, perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me think of the problem as the perimeters of the folded sheets.\n\nWhen you fold the sheet along one side, the perimeter of each part is P1=48, and when along the other, P2=66.\n\nSo the original sheet's area is A = L * W.\n\nWe need to find A.\n\nFrom earlier, I have L=28, W=10 \u2192 A=280. Not in options.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters given are for the entire folded sheet, which is two parts connected along a fold.\n\nWait, perhaps when folded along the length, the entire sheet's perimeter is 48, and when folded along the width, it's 66.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, because when folded, the sheet is still a single piece, but the perimeter would change.\n\nWait, perhaps when folding along the length, the sheet becomes a rectangle of L \u00d7 (W/2), so the perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W.\n\nIf this equals 48, equation 1: 2L + W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the sheet becomes (L/2) \u00d7 W. Perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W=66.\n\nSo equations:\n\n1) 2L + W=48.\n\n2) L +2W=66.\n\nLet me solve these.\n\nMultiply equation 2 by 2: 2L +4W=132.\n\nSubtract equation 1: (2L +4W) - (2L +W) )=132-48 \u21923W=84 \u2192 W=28.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: L +56=66 \u2192 L=10.\n\nSo L=10, W=28.\n\nArea=10*28=280. Same result.\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the perimeter when folded is the sum of both parts. For example, when folded along the length, the sheet is divided into two parts, but their combined perimeter is 48, but that seems odd.\n\nWait, no, because each part is a separate rectangle, so their perimeters are separate.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the answer is not among the options, or perhaps I've made a mistake in the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the way I interpret the folding direction.\n\nWait, perhaps when folding along the length, the sheet's length is halved, but the perimeter is calculated as 2*(half the length + width).\n\nWait, but that's what I've been doing.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is a square, but the problem states it's rectangular, so that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters provided are the sum of the perimeters of both parts when folded. So when folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48, so two parts would have 96. Similarly for 66, two parts would be 132.\n\nBut that would change the equations.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nIf when folded along the length, the two parts have a combined perimeter of 48, so each part is 24.\n\nSo the equations would be:\n\nFold along length: each part's perimeter is 24.\n\nSo 2*(L/2 + W) =24 \u2192 L +2W=48.\n\nFold along width: each part's perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)= 33.\n\nBut 2L + W=66.\n\nWait, so same equations as before. Same solution: L=28, W=10. Area=280.\n\nNo match with options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the entire folded sheet, including both parts.\n\nWait, but each part is a separate rectangle, so their perimeters are separate. So the total perimeter for both parts would be 96 (each 48) and 132 (each 66).\n\nBut I don't see how that helps.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 3 somewhere, but I can't figure out where.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into four parts, but the question says two equal halves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the entire sheet when folded, not each part. Let me try that.\n\nWhen the sheet is folded along the length, it becomes a rectangle of L \u00d7 (W/2), so perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W.\n\nIf this equals 48, equation 1: 2L + W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, it's (L/2) \u00d7 W \u2192 perimeter 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W=66.\n\nEquations:\n\n1) 2L + W=48\n\n2) L + 2W=66\n\nSolving:\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2:4L + 2W=96.\n\nEquation 2: L +2W=66.\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 1: 3L=30 \u2192 L=10.\n\nThen from equation 2: 10 +2W=66 \u21922W=56 \u2192 W=28.\n\nSo area=10*28=280.\n\nSame result.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options.\n\nWait, looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me see if any of the options' square roots match possible L and W.\n\nOption E is 1200. So L * W=1200. Let's see possible factors.\n\nFor example, L=50, W=24 \u2192 area 1200.\n\nCheck perimeters:\n\nFold along length: each part is 25 \u00d724 \u2192 perimeter 2*(25+24)=98.\n\nFold along width: each part is 50 \u00d712 \u2192 perimeter 2*(50+12)=124.\n\nThese don't match the given perimeters of 48 and 66.\n\nAnother option: D)1320. Let's see L=60, W=22. Area=1320.\n\nFold along length: each part is 30 \u00d722 \u2192 perimeter 2*(30+22)=104.\n\nFold along width: each part is 60 \u00d711 \u2192 perimeter 2*(60+11)=142. No match.\n\nOption C)792. Let's try L=36, W=22. Area=792.\n\nFold along length: 18*22 \u2192 perimeter 2*(18+22)=80. Not 48.\n\nHmm.\n\nOption B)1120. Let's say L=40, W=28. Area=1120.\n\nFold along length: 20*28 \u2192 perimeter 2*(20+28)=96. Not 48.\n\nHmm, perhaps L=32, W=35. 32*35=1120.\n\nFold along length: 16*35 \u2192 perimeter 2*(16+35)=102. Not 48.\n\nHmm.\n\nOption A)1584. Possible factors: 36*44.\n\nFold along length: 18*44 \u2192 perimeter 2*(18+44)=124. Not 48.\n\nHmm, none of these options seem to fit the given perimeters of 48 and 66 when folded.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but according to the calculations, it's 280.\n\nBut since 280 isn't present, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, but the perimeters given are for the entire folded sheet, not each part.\n\nSo when folded along the length, the entire sheet (which is now a single rectangle of L \u00d7 (W/2)) has a perimeter of 48.\n\nSo 2*(L + W/2)=48 \u2192 2L + W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the entire sheet is (L/2) \u00d7 W \u2192 perimeter 2*(L/2 + W)= L + 2W=66.\n\nSo equations:\n\n1) 2L + W=48.\n\n2) L +2W=66.\n\nSolving:\n\nMultiply equation1 by 2:4L + 2W=96.\n\nEquation2: L +2W=66.\n\nSubtract equation2 from equation1: 3L=30 \u2192 L=10.\n\nThen W= (48-20)=28.\n\nSo area=10*28=280.\n\nSame result.\n\nHmm, given that, perhaps the correct answer is 280, but it's not in the options. But the options are A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the equations earlier. Let me consider that the perimeters are for the entire sheet when folded, so each part is half the original.\n\nWait, when the sheet is folded along the length, each part is (L/2) \u00d7 W.\n\nPerimeter of each part is 2*(L/2 + W)= L + 2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is L \u00d7 (W/2). Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)= 2L + W=66.\n\nSo equations:\n\n1) L + 2W=48.\n\n2) 2L + W=66.\n\nSolving:\n\nMultiply equation1 by 2: 2L +4W=96.\n\nEquation2:2L + W=66.\n\nSubtract equation2 from equation1: 3W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nSubstitute into equation1: L +20=48 \u2192 L=28.\n\nArea=28*10=280.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo I'm confident that the correct area is 280, but since it's not an option, perhaps the problem intended different perimeters or a different setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you fold the sheet, the perimeter is the sum of the perimeters of both parts.\n\nBut for that, when folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48, so two parts would have a combined perimeter of 96.\n\nBut I don't know how that would help, as each part's perimeter is given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters include both the folded and unfolded edges.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeter of the folded sheet is 48, which would include the folded edge.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended that when folded along one side, the entire sheet's perimeter is 48, and when folded along the other, it's 66.\n\nSo, when folded along the length, the sheet's dimensions are L \u00d7 (W/2). Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the dimensions are (L/2) \u00d7 W. Perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W)= L + 2W=66.\n\nSo equations:\n\n1) 2L + W=48.\n\n2) L +2W=66.\n\nSolving:\n\nMultiply equation1 by 2:4L + 2W=96.\n\nEquation2: L +2W=66.\n\nSubtract equation2 from equation1:3L=30 \u2192 L=10.\n\nThen from equation2:10 +2W=66 \u21922W=56 \u2192 W=28.\n\nArea=10*28=280.\n\nSame result again.\n\nHmm, perhaps the options are wrong, or perhaps I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps the area is 280, but the options are in different units.\n\nBut the options are all numbers, so perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but according to the calculations, it's 280. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the equations. Let me try to write the equations again.\n\nWait, when the sheet is folded along the length, each part has dimensions (L/2) \u00d7 W. Perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part has dimensions L \u00d7 (W/2). Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W=66.\n\nSo equations:\n\n1) L + 2W =48.\n\n2) 2L + W=66.\n\nSolving:\n\nMultiply equation1 by 2: 2L +4W=96.\n\nEquation2:2L + W=66.\n\nSubtract equation2 from equation1: 3W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nThen from equation1: L +20=48 \u2192 L=28.\n\nArea=28 *10=280.\n\nSame result.\n\nBut since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but I must have made a mistake in setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you fold the sheet along the length, the resulting sheet's perimeter is 48, which is for both parts. So each part has half the perimeter.\n\nSo 48 is the sum of both parts, each having 24.\n\nBut that approach leads to the same result as before.\n\nWait, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nWait, another way: The area of the sheet is A = L*W.\n\nWe have two equations based on the perimeters when folded.\n\nWhen folded along the length: 2*(L + W/2) =66 \u2192 2L + W=66.\n\nWhen folded along the width: 2*(L/2 + W) =48 \u2192 L +2W=48.\n\nSo equations:\n\n1)2L + W=66.\n\n2)L +2W=48.\n\nLet me solve these.\n\nMultiply equation 2 by 2:2L +4W=96.\n\nEquation1:2L + W=66.\n\nSubtract equation1 from this:3W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nSubstitute into equation2: L +20=48 \u2192 L=28.\n\nSo area is 28*10=280.\n\nSame result again.\n\nHmm. I think I'm going around in circles here. The correct answer according to my calculations is 280, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps when the sheet is folded along one set of sides, the perimeter is 48 cm for each part, but each part is not a rectangle but a square.\n\nWait, but that would require that L= W, which is not possible as it's a rectangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the sheet is folded along the diagonal, but that's not mentioned.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possibilities, and the only conclusion I can reach is that the area is 280, but since it's not an option, perhaps the problem has a typo or the options are wrong.\n\nBut looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup, perhaps the perimeters are for the entire sheet, not each part.\n\nWait, perhaps when folded along the length, the entire sheet's perimeter is 48, which is half of the original perimeter.\n\nBut the original perimeter would then be 96.\n\nWait, but let's proceed.\n\nWhen folded along the length, the sheet becomes a rectangle of L \u00d7 (W/2). Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, it's (L/2) \u00d7 W. Perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W)= L + 2W=66.\n\nSo same equations as before: 2L + W=48 and L +2W=66.\n\nWhich leads to L=10, W=28. Area=280.\n\nSame result.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is C)792. But I can't see how that would work.\n\nWait, let me try to see if any of the options would work with the equations.\n\nLet me think: If the area is 792, perhaps L and W are factors of 792.\n\nPossible factors: 792= 24*33, 22*36, etc.\n\nLet me try L=33, W=24.\n\nFold along length: each part is 16.5 x24 \u2192 perimeter 2*(16.5+24)=2*40.5=81 cm. Not 48.\n\nNope.\n\nAnother option: L=36, W=22.\n\nFold along length: 18 x22 \u2192 perimeter 2*(18+22)=80. Not 48.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the problem is that when folded along the length, the sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeter is 48 for the entire folded sheet, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire sheet, when folded, has a perimeter of 48 cm. So when folded along the length, the sheet becomes L \u00d7 (W/2), perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, it's (L/2) \u00d7 W, perimeter 2*(L/2 + W)=66.\n\nSo, equations:\n\n1) 2L + W=48.\n\n2) L +2W=66.\n\nWhich solve to L=10, W=28. Area=280.\n\nSame result.\n\nHmm. I think I have to conclude that the correct answer is 280, but it's not in the options. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake, but I can't see where.\n\n\nThe problem involves a rectangular sheet with length \\( L \\) and width \\( W \\). When folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. When folded along the other set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 66 cm. The goal is to find the area of the original sheet.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Folding Along Length**:  \n   When folded along the length, each part has dimensions \\( L \\) and \\( W/2 \\). The perimeter of each part is given by:  \n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\left( L + \\frac{W}{2} \\right) = 48 \\implies 2L + W = 48 \\tag{1}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Folding Along Width**:  \n   When folded along the width, each part has dimensions \\( L/2 \\) and \\( W \\). The perimeter of each part is given by:  \n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\left( \\frac{L}{2} + W \\right) = 66 \\implies L + 2W = 66 \\tag{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solving the System of Equations**:  \n   From equation (1):  \n   \\[\n   2L + W = 48\n   \\]  \n   Multiply equation (1) by 2:  \n   \\[\n   4L + 2W = 96 \\tag{3}\n   \\]  \n   Subtract equation (2) from equation (3):  \n   \\[\n   (4L + 2W) - (L + 2W) = 96 - 66 \\implies 3L = 30 \\implies L = 10\n   \\]  \n   Substitute \\( L = 10 \\) into equation (2):  \n   \\[\n   10 + 2W = 66 \\implies 2W = 56 \\implies W = 28\n   \\]\n\n4. **Area of the Sheet**:  \n   The area of the original sheet is:  \n   \\[\n   A = L \\times W = 10 \\times 28 = 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe calculated area of the sheet is \\( 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\). However, none of the provided options (A) 1584, (B) 1120, (C) 792, (D) 1320, (E) 1200) match this result. Despite extensive verification, the calculations consistently yield \\( 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\), suggesting either an issue with the problem's options or a misinterpretation of the setup.\n\n**Answer: None of the options are correct based on the calculations.**",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rectangular sheet being folded into two equal halves. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but let me try to break it down.\n\nThe question says when the sheet is folded along one set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. And when folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter is 66 cm. We need to find the area of the original sheet.\n\nWait, so the sheet is a rectangle. Let's say the original length is L and the width is W. When you fold it along one set of sides, you're halving either the length or the width, I think. So, let me visualize that.\n\nIf you fold it along the length, meaning along the longer sides, then each half would have a length of L/2 and width W, right? Because you're folding along the length, so the length becomes half. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh, wait, no. If you fold along the length, you split the width? No, wait, when you fold a rectangle along one set of sides, you're bringing the two opposite sides together. So, for example, if it's a standard rectangle, folding along the longer sides would divide the length into two, so each part would be L/2 by W.\n\nSame with folding along the width. Folding along the width would split the width into two, so each part would be L by W/2.\n\nSo when it's folded along one set, the perimeters are 48 cm each. And when folded along the other, the perimeters are 66 cm each.\n\nWait, but each part has a certain perimeter. So let's think about the two scenarios.\n\nFirst case: folding along the length (so the length is halved). Each smaller rectangle has dimensions L/2 and W. The perimeter of each is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W = 48 cm.\n\nSecond case: folding along the width (so the width is halved). Each smaller rectangle has dimensions L and W/2. The perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W = 66 cm.\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1) L + 2W = 48\n2) 2L + W = 66\n\nHmm, solving for L and W. Let's write them down:\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W =48\nEquation 2: 2L + W =66\n\nI can use substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination.\n\nMaybe multiply equation 1 by 2 to make the L terms match.\n\nEquation 1 multiplied by 2: 2L +4W =96\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W =66\n\nNow subtract equation 2 from the modified equation 1:\n\n(2L +4W) - (2L + W) =96 -66\n\nThis gives 3W =30 \u2192 W=10 cm.\n\nNow plug W=10 into equation 1: L + 2*10=48 \u2192 L=48-20=28 cm.\n\nWait, so L is 28 cm and W is 10 cm. Then the area would be L * W =28 *10=280 cm\u00b2? But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 280. The options are 1584, 1120, 792, 1320, 1200. Hmm, that's way smaller than the options. Did I make a mistake?\n\nOh wait a second. Wait, the problem says \"folded into two equal halves\". So when I fold along the length, each part's perimeter is 48 cm. But I assumed that the perimeter per half is 48, but maybe the combined perimeters is 48? Or perhaps I misapplied the dimensions.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you fold the sheet along one side, you get two smaller rectangles. Each of these smaller rectangles has a perimeter of 48 cm. So for each part, the perimeter is 48. So earlier calculation should be correct.\n\nBut according to that, the area is 280, which is not among the options. So I must have made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nWait another thought: when you fold a rectangle into two equal parts, the resulting shape is a rectangle with half the area. But perhaps the perimeters are for the folded sheet as a whole? No, the question says each part. So each half must have a perimeter of 48 cm when folded along one set of sides, and 66 cm when folded along the other.\n\nWait, perhaps the way I set up the equations is incorrect. Let me reevaluate the perimeters.\n\nWhen folding along the length (L), the new dimensions are L/2 and W. So the perimeter of each half would be 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W. Which I thought was correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's the entire folded sheet's perimeter? No, the question says each part has a perimeter. So I think my initial setup is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps L and W are the dimensions of the original sheet, so the area is L*W. If I get L=28 and W=10, then area is 280. But the options don't have 280. So maybe I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait, looking back at the equations:\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W =48\nEquation 2: 2L + W =66\n\nWait, let me solve them again.\n\nFrom equation 1: L =48 -2W\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n2*(48-2W) + W =66\n\n96 -4W + W=66 \u2192 96-3W=66 \u2192 -3W= -30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nThen L=48-2*10=28.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut the area is 28*10=280, which isn't an option. So perhaps I misread the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the entire folded sheets, not each part. Let me think again.\n\nIf the sheet is folded into two equal parts, perhaps the perimeters given are for the folded sheets as a whole. So if you fold along the length, the entire folded sheet would have a perimeter of 48 cm, not each part.\n\nWait, that would make more sense. Because if the sheet is folded into two parts, each part is a rectangle. But the entire folded sheet is a rectangle of L/2 and W. So the perimeter of the folded sheet (as a single rectangle) is 2*(L/2 + W) = L +2W =48 cm.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, the folded sheet is L by W/2, so perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W =66 cm. So that's the same as before. So why the answer doesn't match any option. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I've got the dimensions wrong. Let me reassign variables.\n\nLet me suppose that when folded along the length, the sheet is split into two, so each part is (W/2) by L. Or wait, maybe I mixed up the length and width.\n\nWait, perhaps the length is W and the width is L. Wait, maybe I should name the length as the longer side. Wait, no, perhaps I should let L be the original length and W the original width. So when folded along the length, the sheet becomes two pieces each of size (L/2) by W. So the perimeter of each is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each is L by (W/2). Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W=66.\n\nSo solving again, same as before. L=28, W=10. Area=280.\n\nBut the options are way larger. So maybe the perimeters are for the folded sheet as a whole, not each part. So perhaps I should be using the perimeters as the folded sheet's perimeter, not each part.\n\nWait, let me read the question again: \"folded into two equal halves... a perimeter of 48cm for each part\". Oh, wait, each part. So each part has a perimeter of 48. So if I have one part, it's a rectangle, and its perimeter is 48.\n\nSo earlier calculation was correct, but the area is 280, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe I got the perimeters wrong.\n\nWhen the sheet is folded along one set of sides (length), each half is (L/2) x W. Then the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along the other set (width), each half is L x (W/2). Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W =66.\n\nSo equations:\n\n1) L + 2W =48\n\n2) 2L + W =66\n\nSolving:\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2: 2L +4W=96\n\nSubtract equation 2: (2L +4W) - (2L + W) =96-66 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nThen equation 1: L =48-20=28.\n\nSo original sheet is 28 x 10. Area is 280. But no option matches.\n\nWait the options are in 1000s. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Maybe the perimeters are for the folded sheet as a whole, not each part.\n\nWait, let's try that. If the entire folded sheet's perimeter is 48 when folded along the length. Then the folded sheet is (L/2) x W. Perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, it's L x (W/2). Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSo same as before. Therefore, same solution. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait, maybe when you fold the sheet, each part's perimeter is 48? Or perhaps the perimeters are for the combined sheets. No, the question says each part.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider that the sheet is folded into two parts, but not necessarily each part being a rectangle. No, when you fold a rectangle along its length or width, each part is a smaller rectangle.\n\nWait, maybe the way I thought about the folded dimensions is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the entire original sheet when folded, meaning the perimeter is of the folded sheet. But that doesn't make much sense, because the folded sheet's perimeter would be the same as one of the smaller sheets.\n\nWait, I'm confused because my calculation gives 280, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nWait another approach: Let\u2019s call the original length x and width y.\n\nWhen folded along the length (so along the longer sides), each part is x/2 by y. The perimeter of each is 2*(x/2 + y) = x + 2y =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is x by y/2. Perimeter is 2*(x + y/2)= 2x + y=66.\n\nSo same as before.\n\nSo solving:\n\nFrom first equation: x =48 -2y.\n\nSubstitute into second equation:\n\n2*(48-2y) + y =66 \u2192 96 -4y + y =66 \u2192 96-3y=66 \u2192 3y=30 \u2192 y=10.\n\nThen x=48-20=28.\n\nArea is x*y=28*10=280 cm\u00b2. Again, not in the options.\n\nBut wait, the options are 792, 1320, etc. Maybe I'm missing a factor of 4 or something? Let me think, perhaps the perimeters are for the two parts together. No, the question says each part.\n\nWait, is it possible that the sheet is folded along the longer side, making the longer side half, and the other case along the shorter side, making the shorter side half? Maybe I confused length and width.\n\nWait, let me think: perhaps the sheet is L x W, and when folded along the length (so the L becomes L/2), the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width (so W becomes W/2), the perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W=66.\n\nSo same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded such that the perimeter of the entire folded sheet is given. So for example, when folded along length, the sheet is folded into two, so the new sheet has dimensions L/2 and W, and the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L+2W =48.\n\nWait, but that's the same as each part's perimeter. So same result.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. The answer I get isn't an option. Maybe I did the problem wrong.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, but the way I'm thinking about the perimeter is incorrect. Let me think, when a sheet is folded along the length, each part is L/2 by W, and each part has a perimeter. So each part is a separate rectangle. So for each part, the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWait, but perhaps the sheet is folded into two, making a larger sheet? No, I think it's two equal parts, each a separate rectangle.\n\nWait, perhaps when folded along the length, the new sheet is (L/2) by W, but the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48. That's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should be using (L/2) and (W/2) in the equations. Wait no, that would be if the sheet was folded both along length and width, but the question says folded along one set of sides each time.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, but the way I'm calculating the perimeter is wrong. Let me think: when the sheet is folded along the length, each half is L/2 by W. So each half is a rectangle with length L/2 and width W. So perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, each half is L by W/2. Perimeter 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W=66.\n\nSo same equations. So same solution.\n\nHmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, let me check the equations again.\n\nEquations:\n\n1) L + 2W =48\n\n2) 2L + W =66\n\nFrom equation 1, L =48-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n2*(48-2W) + W =66 \u2192 96-4W + W =66 \u2192 96-3W=66 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nThen L=48-20=28.\n\nArea=28*10=280.\n\nHmm, but that's not an option. So perhaps I should recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe question says: the perimeter is 48cm when folded along one set of sides, and 66cm when folded along the other. So each part has 48 and 66 as perimeters.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are not of each part, but of the folded sheet. So when you fold it, you get one sheet, not two. Then the perimeter of that single sheet is 48 when folded along one side, and 66 when folded along the other.\n\nAh! Maybe that's where I went wrong. Let me think again.\n\nIf the sheet is folded along one set of sides, the new sheet is (L/2) by W. Then the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along the other set, the sheet is L by (W/2). Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) =2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations as before, so same solution. So same result, area=280.\n\nBut the options are much higher. So perhaps I'm missing a factor. Like, perhaps the sheet is folded into two, but each part is a square, not a rectangle. But no, the question says it's a rectangle.\n\nWait, maybe the sheet is folded along the length and then along the width, but that creates four smaller rectangles. No, the question says when folded along one set of sides, not both.\n\nWait, perhaps the original sheet is folded into two equal parts, but the way the perimeters are calculated is different. Wait, maybe when folded along the length, each part is (L) by (W/2). Because if you fold along the length, you're bringing the two W sides together.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the dimensions wrong. Let me think: when you fold a rectangle along its length, you're bringing the two longer sides together, so the length remains the same, but the width is halved.\n\nWait, no, wait. Imagine a standard sheet of paper. If you fold it along the longer side, you're making the length half. Alternatively, if you fold it along the shorter side, you're halving the width.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from which side is being folded. Let me clarify:\n\n- The sheet is a rectangle, say, with length L (long) and width W (short).\n\n- Folding along the length (long sides): you bring the two longer sides together. So the sheet is now folded into two parts, each with length L/2 and width W.\n\n- Folding along the width (short sides): you bring the two shorter sides together. So each part has length L and width W/2.\n\nSo when you fold along the length, each part is (L/2) by W. So perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen you fold along the width, each part is L by (W/2). So perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) =2L + W=66.\n\nSo same equations as before. So same solution.\n\nSo I don't see where I went wrong. The area comes out to 280. But the options don't have 280, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, maybe I should define the variables differently. Let's let the original sheet have dimensions x and y. Then, when folded along x, each part is (x/2) by y. Perimeter is 2*(x/2 + y) =x +2y=48.\n\nWhen folded along y, each part is x by (y/2). Perimeter is 2*(x + y/2)=2x + y=66.\n\nSo same as before. So same solution.\n\nWait, perhaps I should assign variables differently. Let me think, maybe the sheet is folded along the longer side, but I assumed L was longer. Maybe W is longer. Let's say the original sheet has L as width and W as length. So when folded along the length (W), each part is (W/2) by L.\n\nWait, that would change the equations.\n\nSo, when folded along the length (W), each part is (W/2) by L. Perimeter is 2*(W/2 + L) = W +2L=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width (L), each part is W by (L/2). Perimeter is 2*(W + L/2) =2W + L=66.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n1) W +2L=48\n\n2) 2W + L=66\n\nLet me solve these.\n\nEquation 1: W =48 -2L.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n2*(48-2L) + L =66 \u219296 -4L +L =66 \u219296-3L=66 \u21923L=30 \u2192 L=10.\n\nThen W=48-2*10=28.\n\nSo original dimensions are L=10 and W=28.\n\nArea is 10*28=280, same as before. So I'm still getting 280.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is expecting the area to be in square meters or something else? No, the options are in cm, I think.\n\nWait, looking at the options: 1584, 1120, 792, 1320, 1200. Oh, these are all way larger than 280. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the perimeters given are the sum of both parts. So when folded along one side, the two parts together have a perimeter of 48. But that doesn't make sense, since each part has a perimeter.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when the sheet is folded into two parts, the total perimeter of both parts is 48. But that would mean each part contributes its own perimeter, but that's not the case.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps each part's perimeter is 48 when folded along one side, and 66 when folded along the other. So same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I have it backwards. Maybe when folded along one set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 48, and when folded along the other, each part has a perimeter of 66. So same equations.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the folded sheet's perimeter, not each part. Let me try that.\n\nIf the sheet is folded along one set of sides, the folded sheet has a perimeter of 48.\n\nFor example, when folded along the length, the new sheet is (L/2) x W. Perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W)= L +2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the new sheet is L x (W/2). Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSo same equations as before. So same solution, area=280.\n\nBut since 280 isn't an option, perhaps the question is actually referring to the sum of the perimeters when folded both ways. No, the question states each part separately.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the folded sheet as a whole when folded along both sides. No, the question says when folded along one set, the perimeter is 48, and when along the other, 66.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the sheet is folded into two equal parts, but the perimeters are for the original sheet after folding. So the perimeter of the folded sheet is 48 when folded along one set, and 66 when folded along the other.\n\nSo when folded along length, the sheet becomes L/2 by W. Perimeter: 2*(L/2 + W)=L+2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along width, sheet becomes L by W/2. Perimeter: 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations, same solution.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is in meters instead of centimeters? But the options are in 1000s, so 280 cm\u00b2 is 0.028 m\u00b2, which is too small.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have to multiply by 4 because each fold creates two parts, so the area is four times as much? Wait, no. The original sheet is being folded into two parts, so the area remains the same.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for each part when folded, but I have to account for both parts.\n\nWait, when you fold the sheet into two parts, each part has a perimeter. So if the sheet is folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. But since there are two parts, the total perimeter for both would be 96 cm. Similarly, when folded along the width, each part has a perimeter of 66, so total 132 cm.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the sheet isn't being divided into two separate sheets; each part is a rectangle that's half the original sheet.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem meant that the perimeters are for each part, and each part is a square. But that's not specified.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. My calculation leads to 280, but it's not an option. Maybe the equations are set up wrong.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Let me let the original sheet have length L and width W. When folded along the length, each part is (L/2) x W. So the perimeter for each part is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is L x (W/2). So perimeter 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W=66.\n\nSo same equations.\n\nLet me solve them again:\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W=48 \u2192 L=48-2W.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W=66.\n\nSubstitute L into equation 2:\n\n2*(48-2W) + W=66 \u219296 -4W + W=66 \u2192 96-3W=66 \u2192-3W= -30 \u2192 W=10 cm.\n\nThen L=48-20=28 cm.\n\nArea=28*10=280 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut as the options don't include this, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Maybe the perimeters are for both parts combined.\n\nWait, if when folded along length, each part has a perimeter of 48, and there are two parts, then the total perimeter for both parts is 96. But how? Because each part is a separate rectangle.\n\nWait, but the sheet is folded into two equal parts, but the perimeters are for each part. So 48 each. So my initial setup is correct.\n\nSo perhaps I should re-examine the options. The options are:\n\nA)1584\nB)1120\nC)792\nD)1320\nE)1200.\n\nWait, perhaps my answer is 280, but it's not listed. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me try other possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into four equal parts, not two. Then each part would be (L/2) x (W/2). But the question says two equal halves. So no.\n\nAnother thought: when the sheet is folded along one side, the perimeter of the folded sheet is 48. So the folded sheet is a rectangle of (L/2) by W. Its perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W)= L + 2W=48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the other side, the perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is looking for the area of each part, not the original sheet. But each part is 140 cm\u00b2, which is also not matching the options.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I have to double the area somehow. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is not a rectangle but a square. But the problem says rectangle.\n\nWait, perhaps I should multiply the area by 4, thinking that the sheet is folded into four parts. But that would give 280*4=1120, which is option B.\n\nWait, but the problem says folded into two equal halves, not four. So why would the area be multiplied by 4?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters given are for the folded sheet as a single sheet, but the original sheet is larger. Wait, that doesn't make sense because folding makes the sheet smaller.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the equations backwards. Let me suppose that when folding along the length, the perimeter is 66, and when folding along the width, it's 48. But that would change the equations.\n\nSo:\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W=66\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W=48\n\nSolving:\n\nEquation1: L=66 -2W\n\nSubstitute into equation2:\n\n2*(66-2W) + W=48 \u2192 132-4W +W=48 \u2192132-3W=48 \u21923W=84 \u2192 W=28.\n\nThen L=66-56=10.\n\nArea=10 *28=280 cm\u00b2. Same result.\n\nNo, doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps the equations are:\n\nWhen folded along the length (so each part is (L/2) x W), the perimeter is 66. And when folded along the width (each part is L x W/2), perimeter is48.\n\nSo:\n\nEquation1: L + 2W=66.\n\nEquation2: 2L + W=48.\n\nSolving:\n\nEquation1: L=66-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation2:\n\n2*(66-2W) + W=48 \u2192132 -4W + W =48 \u2192132-3W=48 \u21923W=84 \u2192W=28.\n\nThen L=66-56=10.\n\nArea=10*28=280. Same problem.\n\nSo, the only solution I get from the equations is 280, which is not an option. So perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm completely misunderstanding the setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the perimeters include the folded edge. Like, when you fold a sheet, the folded edge is internal, so perhaps the perimeter is calculated differently.\n\nWait, when you fold a sheet, the folded edge is not part of the perimeter. So for example, when you fold a sheet along the length, the two parts are together, but each part's perimeter is as before. So that doesn't change the perimeter.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Since the options are much larger, perhaps I should consider that the perimeters are for both parts together, so 2*48 and 2*66. Let me try that.\n\nIf when folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48, but two parts, so total perimeter would be 96.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because each part is separate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the combined folded sheets. So when folded along the length, the combined sheet's perimeter is 48. Then, the sheet is L/2 by W. So perimeter=2*(L/2 + W) = L +2W=48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, the perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations, same solution.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is not folded into two, but four parts? No, the question says two.\n\nWait, maybe the sheet is folded along both length and width, making four smaller rectangles. But the question says when folded along one set of sides, so each time only one fold.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Maybe I'll try to see what the options would imply.\n\nLet's look at option D:1320.\n\nIf area is 1320, then L * W =1320.\n\nFrom equation 1: L +2W=48.\n\nFrom equation 2: 2L + W=66.\n\nWe have two equations and two unknowns.\n\nLet me substitute L from equation1 into equation2.\n\nEquation1: L=48-2W.\n\nEquation2: 2*(48-2W)+W=66 \u2192 96-4W + W=66 \u219296-3W=66 \u21923W=30 \u2192W=10.\n\nThen L=48-20=28. Area=28*10=280, not 1320.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should instead think that the perimeters given are after adding both the folded and the original sheet. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps when the sheet is folded along the length, the perimeter of the folded sheet is 48, and when folded along the width, the perimeter is 66. So the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when the sheet is folded along length, the new rectangle has a perimeter of 48. So:\n\nPerimeter = 2*(L/2 + W) = L +2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along width, perimeter is 2*(L + W/2 )=2L + W=66.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo same solution.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe the answer isn't among the options, but since that's not possible, perhaps I made a mistake in initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, but each part's perimeter is 48 and 66. So when folded along length, each part's perimeter is48. When folded along width, each part's perimeter is 66. So same as before.\n\nWait, maybe I should multiply the area by 4, because when you fold a sheet into two parts, each part is a quarter of the original. No, that's not correct. Each part is half.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded twice, so each fold halves the area again. But the question says folded into two equal halves once.\n\nSo, I'm really stuck. I think the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait, wait. Let me try to find the options' possible dimensions.\n\nLooking at option C)792.\n\nIf area is 792, possible L and W could be factors of 792.\n\nLooking for L and W such that L +2W=48 and 2L + W=66.\n\nLet me try:\n\nLet me set L +2W=48 \u2192 L=48-2W.\n\nSubstitute into 2L +W=66:\n\n2*(48-2W) + W=66 \u219296-4W +W=66 \u219296-3W=66 \u21923W=30 \u2192 W=10, L=28. Area=280.\n\nNot 792. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, perhaps the equations are different. Let me consider that when folded along length, the perimeter is 48. So 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along width, the perimeter is 66. So 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSo same equations.\n\nIf I solve for L and W, I get L=28, W=10.\n\nArea=280.\n\nBut 280 is not an option.\n\nWait, unless I made a mistake in the equations. Maybe the perimeters are for the folded sheet when it's folded along the other side. No, that doesn't change anything.\n\nHmm. Another thought: perhaps when the sheet is folded, the perimeter is calculated without considering the folded edge. So for example, when folded along the length, the sheet becomes a rectangle of L/2 by W, but the folded edge is internal, so the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) - 2*(folded edge? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps when you fold a sheet, the perimeter changes because the edge is covered. So for example, when you fold along the length, the sheet has a perimeter of 2*(L/2 + W) but without the folded edge. No, that's not correct because the perimeter is the sum of all outer edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the folded edge is counted as part of the perimeter. Which it is, because it's an edge.\n\nWait, no. When you fold a sheet, the folded edge becomes an internal edge, not part of the perimeter. So for example, if you fold a rectangle of L by W along the length, the resulting shape is two rectangles each of L/2 by W, but when you consider the folded sheet as a single piece, you have an L/2 by W sheet with a perimeter of 2*(L/2 + W) = L+2W=48.\n\nBut that's the same as before.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. I think I have to go with the answer I calculated, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question says the sheet has a perimeter of 48 when folded along one set, and the same sheet has a perimeter of 66 when folded along the other set.\n\nWait, maybe the sheet is folded along one set, then along the other, and the perimeters are for the resulting sheets.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the sheet is folded twice, making four parts. But the question says \"when folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides.\"\n\nSo, when you fold along one set, each part has perimeter 48. When you fold along the other set, each part has perimeter 66.\n\nSo, each fold divides the sheet into two, but each fold is along a different set of sides.\n\nSo, perhaps the sheet's dimensions are such that when you fold along the length, each part is (L/2) x W with perimeter 48, and when you fold along the width, each part is L x (W/2) with perimeter 66.\n\nSo the equations are the same as before.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is 280, but since it's not an option, perhaps there was a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 280. Let me check: 28*10=280. Yes.\n\nBut the options are way higher. Wait, perhaps I should multiply by 4 because the sheet is folded into two, each part is half, so perhaps the area is each part's area multiplied by two? No, because the original area is L*W, which is the sum of the two parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two, but each part's area is (L/2 * W), so two parts would give 2*(L/2 * W) = L*W, same as original.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think I'm stuck, but I'll proceed to answer based on the given options. Since my calculation leads to 280, but it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe the perimeters given are for both parts together. So when folded along length, the two parts have a combined perimeter of 48. So each part has a perimeter of 24.\n\nBut that complicates things. Let me try.\n\nIf each part has a perimeter of 24 when folded along length, then:\n\nEach part is (L/2) x W. Perimeter: 2*(L/2 + W)= L + 2W =24.\n\nWhen folded along width, each part has perimeter 66/2=33.\n\nWait, that complicates it more. I think this approach isn't correct.\n\nI think I've spent too much time on this. Based on the equations, the correct area is 280, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the initial setup is correct, and the problem expects this answer. But since the options don't have it, I'm unsure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the sheet is folded into two, the perimeter of the folded sheet is the same as the perimeter of each part. So, maybe I should double the area.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. I think I'm stuck. I have to choose the closest option, but none of the options match.\n\n\nThe problem involves a rectangular sheet being folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, resulting in a perimeter of 48 cm for each part. When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm. The goal is to determine the area of the original sheet.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Defining Variables**: Let the original length and width of the sheet be \\( L \\) and \\( W \\), respectively.\n\n2. **Folding Along Length**: When folded along the length, each part has dimensions \\( \\frac{L}{2} \\times W \\). The perimeter of each part is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\left( \\frac{L}{2} + W \\right) = L + 2W = 48 \\tag{1}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Folding Along Width**: When folded along the width, each part has dimensions \\( L \\times \\frac{W}{2} \\). The perimeter of each part is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\left( L + \\frac{W}{2} \\right) = 2L + W = 66 \\tag{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving the Equations**:\n   - From equation (1): \\( L = 48 - 2W \\).\n   - Substitute \\( L = 48 - 2W \\) into equation (2):\n     \\[\n     2(48 - 2W) + W = 66 \\implies 96 - 4W + W = 66 \\implies 96 - 3W = 66 \\implies 3W = 30 \\implies W = 10 \\, \\text{cm}.\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( W = 10 \\) back into \\( L = 48 - 2W \\):\n     \\[\n     L = 48 - 2(10) = 28 \\, \\text{cm}.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculating the Area**: The area of the original sheet is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = L \\times W = 28 \\times 10 = 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Mismatch with Options**: The calculated area of \\( 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\) does not match any of the provided options (\\( 1584, 1120, 792, 1320, 1200 \\)). Despite rechecking the equations and assumptions, the result remains consistent. It is possible that the problem statement or options may contain an error.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the correct area is \\( 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\), but since this value is not among the options, the reasoning process concludes here.\n\nANSWER: None of the options match the calculated result.",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to find the area of a rectangular sheet based on some folding information. Hmm, let's see. The problem says that when the sheet is folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm. And when folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter is 66 cm. I need to find the area of the original sheet.\n\nAlright, let me start by visualizing the problem. So, imagine a rectangle. Let's call the length L and the width W. When you fold it along one set of sides, like the length, you end up with two smaller rectangles. Each of these smaller rectangles would have dimensions L/2 by W, right? Because you're folding along the length, so the length becomes half, and the width stays the same.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. When you fold along the length, you're bringing the two ends together along the length, so the length would be halved. So the new dimensions would be L/2 by W. But wait, when you fold along the width, you're halving the width, so the new dimensions would be L by W/2.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when folded along one set of sides, the perimeter is 48 cm, and when folded along the other set, it's 66 cm. So each fold creates two parts, each with a perimeter.\n\nSo for each case, the perimeter of the folded part is given.\n\nLet me approach this step by step. Let's denote the original rectangle's length as L and width as W.\n\nWhen folded along the length (so along the longer side), each part would have dimensions L/2 by W. The perimeter of one part would be 2*( (L/2) + W ). And according to the problem, this perimeter is 48 cm.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width (along the shorter side), each part would have dimensions L by W/2. The perimeter of each part would be 2*(L + (W/2)), and this is 66 cm.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) 2*( (L/2) + W ) = 48\n2) 2*( L + (W/2) ) = 66\n\nLet me simplify these equations.\n\nStarting with equation 1:\n\n2*( (L/2) + W ) = 48\nDivide both sides by 2: (L/2) + W = 24\nMultiply everything by 2 to eliminate fractions: L + 2W = 48. Let's call this equation A.\n\nEquation 2:\n\n2*( L + (W/2) ) = 66\nDivide both sides by 2: L + (W/2) = 33\nMultiply everything by 2: 2L + W = 66. Let's call this equation B.\n\nNow I have two equations:\nA) L + 2W = 48\nB) 2L + W = 66\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find L and W.\n\nLet me use the substitution method. Let me solve equation A for L.\n\nFrom A: L = 48 - 2W.\n\nNow plug this into equation B.\n\n2*(48 - 2W) + W = 66\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\n2*(48) is 96, and 2*(-2W) is -4W. So,\n\n96 -4W + W = 66\nCombine like terms: 96 -3W =66\nSubtract 96 from both sides: -3W = 66 -96 \u2192 -3W= -30\nDivide both sides by -3: W = 10.\n\nNow that I have W, plug back into equation A to find L.\n\nL =48 -2W \u2192 W is 10, so 48 -20=28.\n\nSo L is 28 cm and W is 10 cm.\n\nWait, but let me double-check these values with the original perimeters to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, when folded along the length (L direction), each part is L/2 by W. So L/2=14, W=10. The perimeter is 2*(14+10)=2*24=48 cm. That matches the given value.\n\nWhen folded along the width (W direction), each part is L by W/2. So W/2=5, L=28. Perimeter is 2*(28 +5) = 2*33=66 cm. That also matches. So the values are correct.\n\nNow the area of the original sheet is L * W =28 *10=280 cm\u00b2? Wait, but wait, the options are in numbers like 1584, 1120, etc. Wait, did I miss a step? Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I folded the sheet.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the dimensions wrong when folding. Let me think again. Let me clarify: when you fold a rectangle along its length, which is longer. So maybe the length is longer than the width, so when you fold along the length, you're halving the length, but perhaps I got the way the perimeters are calculated wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when folding, the sheet is folded along the longer side, making the new dimension half the longer side, but perhaps the perimeters are different.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the dimensions reversed. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the sheet is folded along the length, making each part with length L/2 and width W, but maybe the sheet is folded along the width, making each part with length L and width W/2.\n\nNo, that's correct. So my calculations should be correct, but the area I'm getting is 280, which isn't an option. Oh wait, the options are much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the perimeters. Let me recheck. The question says when folded along one set of sides (say, along the length), the perimeter of each part is 48 cm. Wait, when you fold a rectangle along its length, you're dividing the length into two equal parts. So each part has length L/2 and width W. The perimeter of each part is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W = 48 cm. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, each part has dimensions L and W/2. So perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W =66 cm.\n\nWait, so the equations are correct. Then why am I getting 28 and 10, giving 280, which is not among the options. So perhaps I got the setup wrong.\n\nWait, wait a second. Maybe the sheet is folded into two equal parts, but perhaps each part is a square. No, no, the problem just says two equal halves. So each part is a smaller rectangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when folding along the length, the perimeter includes the folded edge, but perhaps I'm missing that. Wait, maybe not. When you fold along the length, the resulting shape is a rectangle with length L/2 and width W. The perimeter is the sum of all four sides, which would be 2*(L/2 + W) as I did before.\n\nWait, but then the area should be L * W. Let me compute L and W again.\n\nWait, from the equations:\n\nEquation A: L + 2W =48\nEquation B: 2L + W=66\n\nSolving A: L=48-2W.\n\nPlug into B: 2*(48-2W) + W=66 \u2192 96 -4W + W=66 \u2192 96-3W=66 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10. So L=48-20=28.\n\nSo area is 28*10=280 cm\u00b2. But this isn't any of the options given. Wait, the options are A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200. None of these is 280. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. Perhaps I mixed up the way the sheet is folded. Maybe when folding along the other set of sides, the perimeter is different.\n\nWait, perhaps when you fold along the length, the dimensions become L/2 and W, but perhaps the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W/2), or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I got the way the folding affects the dimensions wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded along the longer side, which might be the width. Because sometimes, when you fold it along the longer side, the resulting shape has different dimensions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the sheet could be folded along either the length or the width, but perhaps the initial assumption about which side is length and which is width is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that when folded along one set of sides, the perimeter is 48, but that set could be the shorter sides or the longer sides. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote the original dimensions as length L and width W, with L > W. So when folded along the length, each part would have dimensions L/2 and W. When folded along the width, each part would have dimensions L and W/2.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier calculation, this leads to an area of 280, which isn't in the options. So perhaps I'm setting up the equations wrong.\n\nWait another approach: perhaps the sheet is folded along the length, making two parts each with length L/2 and width W, so their perimeters are 2*(L/2 + W) = (L + 2W) =48. That's correct.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part has length L and width W/2. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = (2L + W) =66. So same equations as before. So same L=28, W=10. So area 280, not matching the options.\n\nHmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial equations. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I forgot that after folding, the perimeters include the folded edge. Or maybe not, because when you fold a sheet, the resulting shape is a smaller rectangle, and the perimeter is just based on that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the problem differently. Let me let the original sheet have length L and width W. When folded along the length, the two parts are each L/2 by W. So the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is L by W/2. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W=66.\n\nSo solving:\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W =48.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W=66.\n\nLet me solve these equations again.\n\nFrom equation 1: L =48 - 2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: 2*(48-2W) + W =66 \u2192 96 -4W + W=66 \u2192 96-3W=66 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10. So L=48-20=28.\n\nArea is 28*10=280.\n\nHmm, but the options are way higher. So perhaps I messed up the way the perimeters are calculated.\n\nWait, perhaps when you fold the sheet, the perimeter includes the folded edge as a new side. But no, because when you fold a sheet, you're creating a crease, but the perimeter of each part (the folded piece) would be the sum around the outside. So I don't think the folded edge adds to the perimeter. Let me think about the sheet.\n\nFor example, imagine a sheet of paper. If you fold it along the length, the resulting shape is a smaller rectangle. The perimeter is the sum of all four sides. The folded edge is internal, so it's not part of the perimeter.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Wait, when I fold a sheet along the length, the new piece has one dimension halved. So for example, if I have a sheet of 28 cm length and 10 cm width. Folding along the length would make each part 14 cm by 10 cm. The perimeter would be 2*(14+10)=48 cm, which is correct. Folding along the width would make each part 28 cm by 5 cm. Perimeter is 2*(28+5)=66 cm, which is correct.\n\nSo the calculations seem correct, but the area is 280, which is not an option. So I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeter given is for both parts combined. But no, the question says \"each part.\" So each part has a perimeter of 48 and 66, respectively.\n\nWait, unless the perimeter of each part is counted as the sum of all four sides, including the folded edge. But in that case, when you fold along the length, each part would have the same perimeter as before, but perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeter includes the folded edge, so when folded along the length, each part has a perimeter that includes the new edge. So for example, when folded along the length, each part is L/2 by W. The perimeter would be 2*(L/2 + W) + L. Because the fold introduces a new edge of length L.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Let me think about this. When you fold a sheet along its length, you're essentially bringing two ends together, so each part has dimensions L/2 by W. But the perimeter of each part would include the two sides of W and the two sides of L/2. But when you fold, the crease is a line along the length, so perhaps each part now has an additional edge along that fold.\n\nWait, perhaps when folded, the perimeter of each part is the sum of the outer edges plus the fold line. So for instance, when you fold along the length, each part would have a perimeter of 2*(L/2 + W) + L. Because the fold adds a new side.\n\nHmm, that might change the equations. Let me try that.\n\nSo when folded along the length, each part's perimeter would be 2*(L/2 + W) + L. Because the fold adds an extra length L.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps not. Wait, perhaps not. Because when you fold along the length, the sheet is divided into two equal parts, each with perimeter 2*(L/2 + W). But if you consider the folded edge as part of the perimeter, then each part would have an additional edge of length L/2.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of a real example. Suppose I have a sheet that's 28 cm long and 10 cm wide. When I fold it along the length (so along the 28 cm side), each part is 14 cm by 10 cm. The perimeter of each part is 2*(14 +10)=48 cm, which matches the given value. So the perimeter in this case doesn't include the folded edge because the fold is internal. Hence, my initial calculation seems correct.\n\nBut since the problem leads to an area not present in the options, perhaps I need to reconsider the problem setup.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps when you fold the sheet along one set of sides, you're actually making the perimeter of the folded parts combined. But the problem says \"each part.\"\n\nWait, perhaps each part's perimeter is taken as the sum of all four sides, including the folded edge. So for example, when folded along length L, each part has two sides of L/2 and two sides of W. But the folding adds another side along the fold, which is L/2. So the perimeter would be 2*(L/2 + W) + L/2.\n\nWait, that makes no sense, because the perimeter would then have three sides of W and two of L/2. That can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when you fold along the length, each part has dimensions L/2 by W, and the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) plus the folded edge of length L. But that would make the perimeter 2*(L/2 + W) + L = (L + 2W) + L = 2L + 2W. Which would be the perimeter of the original sheet. That can't be the case because the perimeters given are 48 and 66, which are smaller than the original sheet's perimeter.\n\nWait, the original sheet has perimeter 2(L + W). If when folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm, that's 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48. Similarly, when folded along the width, it's 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W=66.\n\nSo back to the same equations as before.\n\nBut that gives area 280, not matching any options. So perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded along both length and width, but the question says when folded along one set, the perimeter is 48, and when along the other set, it's 66. So perhaps the perimeters are 48 and 66 for each of the two possible folds, each leading to a different perimeter.\n\nBut according to my earlier calculation, that leads to an area not present in the options.\n\nSo perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe the perimeters when folded are referring to the total of both parts.\n\nWait, for example, when the sheet is folded into two parts, perhaps the total perimeter is 48 for both parts combined. But the problem states \"each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66 cm when folded along the other set of sides.\"\n\nHmm, the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.\n\n\"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48 cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66 cm when folded along the other set of sides.\"\n\nAh, perhaps when you fold along one set, each part has a perimeter, and the same when folded along the other set. So the perimeters for each part are 48 and 66, respectively.\n\nWait, but perhaps the total perimeters for both parts when folded along one set are 48 each, but that doesn't make sense. Because when you fold a sheet into two parts, each part has a perimeter, but the total perimeter would be double that, because each part has a new edge where they were folded.\n\nWait, perhaps when the sheet is folded along one set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. So each part's perimeter is 48 cm. But when you have two parts, perhaps the total perimeter is double that, but the problem states that each part has a perimeter of 48 cm.\n\nWait, but no, the problem says \"each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66 cm when folded along the other set.\" So each part's perimeter is 48 and 66, respectively, when folded along each of the two possible sets of sides.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to model the problem differently. Let me think about the perimeters.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me denote the original sheet's length as L and width as W.\n\nWhen folded along the length (so along the longer side), each part's dimensions are L/2 and W. So the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48 cm.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part's dimensions are L and W/2. The perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)= 2L + W=66 cm.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W =48\nEquation 2: 2L + W=66\n\nSolving these equations again.\n\nFrom equation 1: L=48-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: 2*(48-2W) + W=66 \u2192 96 -4W + W=66 \u2192 96-3W=66 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10 cm.\n\nThen L=48-2*10=28 cm.\n\nArea is L*W=28 *10=280 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut none of the options match this. So I must have made a mistake in setting up the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for both parts combined. Let me think: when you fold the sheet into two parts, each part's perimeter would include the fold line. So maybe the total perimeter for both parts is 2*(each part's perimeter). But that would be double the given values. Let me try that.\n\nSo, when folded along the length, the combined perimeter of both parts would be 2*48=96 cm.\n\nBut the original sheet's perimeter is 2(L + W). So perhaps 2(L + W) =96 cm. Wait, but if that were the case,\n\nThen 2(L+W)=96 \u2192 L+W=48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along width, total perimeter for both parts would be 2*66=132 cm. So 2(L + W) =132 \u2192 L+W=66.\n\nBut that contradicts because L+W can't be both 48 and 66. So that approach must be wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the perimeters given are for the combined shape after folding.\n\nWait, when you fold a sheet, you get one shape, not two. Wait, no, the problem says it's folded into two equal halves. So when you fold, you have two parts, each with their own perimeter.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters of the two parts when folded along one direction sum to 2*(each part's perimeter).\n\nAh, this is getting confusing. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me denote the original rectangle as having length L and width W.\n\nWhen folded along the length (so along the longer side), each part becomes L/2 by W. The perimeter of each part is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48 cm.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is L by W/2. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W=66 cm.\n\nThese equations give me L=28, W=10 \u2192 area 280. Not matching.\n\nBut the options are way larger. So perhaps I need to find L and W such that when folded along the length, the perimeter is 48 cm, but perhaps I have to multiply by 2 somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 in my equations.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the perimeters given are for the entire folded shape, considering both parts. For instance, when folded along the length, the folded shape is L/2 by W, but perhaps the perimeter is calculated as the sum of all four sides, including the folded edge. So each part's perimeter would be 2*(L/2 + W) + L (since the folded edge is an internal crease, but perhaps the problem counts it as part of the perimeter.)\n\nWait, that would give each part's perimeter as 2*(L/2 + W) + L = L + 2W + L = 2L + 2W. Which is the same as the original sheet's perimeter. But that's not possible because the perimeters given are smaller.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the perimeters given are for the entire folded sheet, not each part.\n\nWait, the problem says \"each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66 cm when folded along the other set of sides.\" So each part has a perimeter.\n\nSo perhaps I should model each part's perimeter as 48 and 66.\n\nWait, I'm stuck. Since my initial approach gives 280 and it's not in the options, perhaps I should look for another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I've got the equations wrong. Let me think again.\n\nLet me try to re-express the problem. Let me assign variables correctly.\n\nLet the original rectangle have length x and width y.\n\nWhen folded along one pair of sides (say, along the length), each part is (x/2) by y. The perimeter of each part is 2*(x/2 + y) = x + 2y =48.\n\nWhen folded along the other pair of sides (along the width), each part is x by (y/2). The perimeter of each part is 2*(x + y/2) = 2x + y =66.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n1) x + 2y =48\n2) 2x + y=66\n\nLet me solve these equations again.\n\nEquation 1: x=48 -2y.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: 2*(48-2y) + y=66 \u2192 96-4y + y=66 \u2192 96-3y=66 \u2192 3y=30 \u2192 y=10 cm.\n\nThen x=48-2*10=28 cm.\n\nArea is 28 *10=280 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut the options don't have 280. Hmm. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps when folding along the length, the sheet is folded along the width direction, and vice versa.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the sheet is folded along its width, which would mean the new dimensions are x and y/2, and the perimeter is 2*(x + y/2) =66.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I mixed up the length and width in the equations.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeter when folded along the length is 48, which would correspond to equation 2*(x + y/2)=48, and when folded along the width, it's 2*(x/2 + y)=66.\n\nWait, that would reverse the equations. Let me try that.\n\nEquation 1: 2*(x + y/2) =48 \u2192 2x + y =48.\n\nEquation 2: 2*(x/2 + y)=66 \u2192 x + 2y =66.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations.\n\nEquation 1: 2x + y =48.\n\nEquation 2: x + 2y=66.\n\nLet me solve these using substitution or elimination.\n\nMultiplying equation 2 by 2: 2x +4y=132.\n\nSubtract equation 1: (2x +4y) - (2x +y) )=132-48 \u2192 3y=84 \u2192 y=28.\n\nThen from equation 2: x +2*28=66 \u2192 x=66-56=10.\n\nSo x=10, y=28. Original area is 10*28=280 cm\u00b2. Same result as before.\n\nStill, the area is 280, not in the options. So perhaps the problem is in the way the perimeters are calculated.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeter when folded along the length is 48 cm, but this refers to the entire sheet's perimeter after folding, which would be the sum of all four sides, including the folded edge. So perhaps when folded along the length, the perimeter is 2*(x/2 + y) + x (the folded edge). Because when you fold, the new edge becomes part of the perimeter.\n\nWait, no, because when you fold along the length x, each part has a perimeter of 2*(x/2 + y). But if you consider the overall sheet after folding, the perimeter would be the same as each part's perimeter, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeter is calculated as 2*(x/2 + y) + x, because the fold creates a new edge of length x. Let me try that.\n\nSo when folded along the length, each part has perimeter 2*(x/2 + y) +x = x + 2y +x= 2x +2y.\n\nWait, but that would mean the perimeter is 2x +2y=48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, each part's perimeter would be 2*(x + y/2) + y = 2x + y + y= 2x + 2y=66.\n\nBut then both perimeters would be the same, which is not the case.\n\nHmm, this is getting me nowhere. I'm stuck. Since I can't find an approach that leads to the given options, perhaps I should look for another way. Maybe I should think that the perimeters include both the outer edges and the fold edge.\n\nWait, another way: perhaps each folded part has two of the original edges and two new edges from the fold. For example, when folded along the length, each part has two lengths of x/2 and two widths of y, but also two lengths of x from the fold. So the perimeter would be 2*(x/2 + y) + 2x = x + 2y +2x= 3x +2y =48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, each part's perimeter would be 2*(x + y/2) + 2y=2x + y +2y=2x +3y=66.\n\nNow we have two new equations:\n\n1) 3x +2y=48.\n\n2) 2x +3y=66.\n\nNow let's solve these equations.\n\nLet's use elimination.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 3: 9x +6y=144.\n\nMultiply equation 2 by 2:4x +6y=132.\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n(9x +6y) - (4x +6y)=144-132 \u21925x=12 \u2192x=12/5=2.4 cm.\n\nThen substitute x=2.4 into equation 1: 3*(2.4) +2y=48 \u21927.2 +2y=48 \u21922y=40.8 \u2192y=20.4 cm.\n\nSo area is x*y=2.4 *20.4=48.96 cm\u00b2. That's way too small and doesn't match the options either.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe when folded, the perimeter is that of the resulting shape plus the fold line.\n\nWait, but that's unclear. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps the perimeters given are for the entire folded sheet, not each part.\n\nWait, for example, when folded along the length, the sheet becomes a single folded shape. But the problem states it's divided into two equal parts. So each part has a perimeter.\n\nI'm stuck. Perhaps I should consider another approach by letting the original sheet have dimensions a and b.\n\nWait, perhaps I should let the sheet be folded along its length, making the new dimensions a/2 and b. The perimeter of each part is 2*(a/2 + b) =a + 2b =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the new dimensions are a and b/2. Perimeter is 2*(a + b/2)=2a +b=66.\n\nSo equations:\n\n1) a +2b=48.\n\n2) 2a +b=66.\n\nSolving:\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2: 2a +4b=96.\n\nSubtract equation 2: (2a +4b) - (2a +b) =96-66 \u21923b=30 \u2192b=10.\n\nThen, from equation 1: a=48-2*10=28.\n\nArea is 28*10=280 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem requires the perimeters to be calculated as 2*(a/2 + b) +a, which would be 2*(a/2 +b) +a= (a +2b) +a=2a +2b=48.\n\nBut then, when folded along the width, the perimeter would be 2*(a +b/2) +b= (2a +b) +b=2a +2b=66.\n\nWait, that would mean both perimeters are 48 and 66, but 2a +2b=48 and 2a +2b=66 which is impossible.\n\nHmm. I'm not getting anywhere. Perhaps the problem is that I'm not considering that when folded, the sheet's perimeter is the sum of all outer edges, including the fold.\n\nWait, perhaps when you fold a sheet along the length, the perimeter of each part is calculated as the sum of the outer edges plus the fold line. So each part's perimeter would be 2*(a/2 + b) +a.\n\nThat is, perimeter = 2*(a/2 + b) +a = (a + 2b) +a = 2a +2b.\n\nWhich would be 2a +2b=48 when folded along the length.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, each part's perimeter would be 2*(a + b/2) +b= (2a +b) +b=2a +2b=66.\n\nBut this leads to 2a+2b=48 and 2a+2b=66, which is impossible.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think I need to consider that perhaps the problem is expecting the area to be in square meters or something, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are given for both parts together. Let me think.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. So two parts would have a total perimeter of 96 cm. But the original sheet's perimeter is 2(a +b). So 2(a +b)=96 \u2192a +b=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part has a perimeter of 66 cm. So two parts have 132 cm. So 2(a +b)=132 \u2192a +b=66.\n\nBut this would mean a +b=48 and a +b=66, which is impossible.\n\nHmm. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps when folding along one direction, the sheet is divided into two parts, but the perimeter of both parts combined is 48 cm. So each part's perimeter would be 24 cm. But that seems too small.\n\nBut earlier calculation gives 280 cm\u00b2, which is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters given are for the entire sheet after folding, not each part. Let me try that.\n\nWhen folded along the length, the sheet becomes a single piece of a/2 by b. The perimeter would be 2*(a/2 + b) = a +2b=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the sheet becomes a single piece of a by b/2. Perimeter is 2*(a + b/2)=2a +b=66.\n\nSame equations as before. So a=28, b=10 \u2192 area 280 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut no option matches. So perhaps I should look for another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to multiply the perimeters by 2 to get the original sheet's perimeter. Let me see.\n\nIf when folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48, perhaps the original sheet's perimeter is 48 *2=96. So 2*(a +b)=96 \u2192a +b=48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, each part's perimeter is 66 \u2192 original perimeter is 132 \u2192 2*(a +b)=132 \u2192a +b=66. Again, conflicting values.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should refer to the given options and see if any can be obtained by a different approach.\n\nLooking at the options: A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200.\n\nThese are all multiples of 100 or 1000, which suggests that the area is in square meters or something, but the perimeters are in cm, so perhaps the area is in cm\u00b2, but 280 isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem and the perimeters are for the entire sheet, not each part. Let me try that.\n\nWhen folded along the length, the sheet's perimeter is 48 cm. So 2*(a/2 + b)=48 \u2192 a +2b=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the sheet's perimeter is 66 cm. So 2*(a + b/2)=66 \u2192 2a +b=66.\n\nSame equations as before. So a=28, b=10 \u2192 area 280. Still no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when folded along the length, the sheet's perimeter is 48 cm, which would be the perimeter of each part. So each part has a perimeter of 48, but the sheet is one piece. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nI'm running out of ideas. Perhaps the correct answer is 280, but since it's not an option, I must have made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when the sheet is folded along one set of sides, it creates a larger shape with a perimeter of 48, and when folded along the other set, a perimeter of 66.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded such that the folded edge is included in the perimeter.\n\nWait, perhaps when the sheet is folded along its length, the new perimeter is 48 cm. So the new dimensions would be a/2 by b. The perimeter is 2*(a/2 + b) =48. So, a +2b=48.\n\nWhen folded along its width, the new shape is a by b/2. Perimeter is 2*(a + b/2) =66 \u2192 2a +b=66.\n\nSame equations as before. So a=28, b=10. Area 280.\n\nBut no option, so perhaps I'm missing a multiplier. Maybe the perimeters are in another unit, but the problem says cm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded twice, but the problem says it's folded into two equal parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeters given are for both parts. So when folded along the length, the total of both parts' perimeters is 48 cm. So each part has 24 cm. But 24 cm is too small for the perimeter.\n\nWait, 24 cm would imply that 2*(a/2 + b) =24 \u2192a +2b=24.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, 2*(a + b/2)=33 \u21922a +b=33.\n\nSo two equations:\n\n1) a +2b=24.\n\n2) 2a +b=33.\n\nLet me solve these.\n\nFrom equation 1: a=24-2b.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: 2*(24-2b) +b=33 \u219248 -4b +b=33 \u219248-3b=33 \u21923b=15 \u2192b=5.\n\nThen a=24-10=14.\n\nArea is 14*5=70 cm\u00b2. Not matching the options.\n\nI'm really stuck here. I think I'll have to proceed with the initial approach and note that the correct area is 280, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the area in a different way.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the perimeters given are for the combined shape after folding, not each part.\n\nWait, when you fold a sheet along the length, the resulting shape is a single rectangle of a/2 by b. Its perimeter is 2*(a/2 +b) =a +2b=48.\n\nWhen you fold along the width, the shape is a by b/2. Perimeter is 2*(a +b/2)=2a +b=66.\n\nSame equations as before. So a=28, b=10.\n\nArea is 28*10=280 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut the options are much larger. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should multiply the area by 4, thinking that each part is a quarter of the original sheet. But no, the sheet is folded into two parts, not four.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should multiply the area by 2, thinking that each part is half, but no, the area of the original sheet is the same regardless of folding.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem setup. Maybe when you fold along the length, the perimeter is calculated differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeter of each part when folded along the length is 48, which is the sum of the two new sides. So, when folded along the length, each part has a perimeter that includes the halved length and the original width, but perhaps the fold adds another length.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeter is 2*(a/2 +b) +a. Because when you fold, you have the outer edges and the inner fold. So for each part, the perimeter would be (a/2 +b) + (a/2 +b) + a (the fold line). Wait, but that would be a/2 +b +a/2 +b +a = a +2b +a = 2a +2b. Which would be 2*(a +b)=48 \u2192a +b=24.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part's perimeter would be 2*(a + b/2) +b=2a +b +b= 2a +2b=66 \u2192a +b=33.\n\nBut this leads to a +b=24 and 33, which is impossible. So this approach can't be correct.\n\nI think I'm stuck and perhaps the correct answer is 280, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the area as 792, which is option C.\n\nWait, 792 is 280*2.83... but how? Hmm. Wait, perhaps the perimeters given are not for each part but for the entire sheet when folded.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when the sheet is folded, the perimeter is the sum of all four sides, but including the folded edge. So, for example, when folded along the length, the sheet is now a/2 by b, but the perimeter would be 2*(a/2 +b) +a (the fold line). So the total perimeter is a +2b +a=2a +2b=48 \u2192a +b=24.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the perimeter is 2*(a +b/2) +b=2a +b +b=2a +2b=66 \u2192a +b=33.\n\nBut again, a +b can't be both 24 and 33. So this approach is invalid.\n\nHmm. I think I'm out of options. I'll have to proceed with the initial calculation and see that the area is 280, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup, and the correct answer isn't among the options. But the problem says to choose from the given options, so perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the perimeters are for the entire sheet after folding, not each part.\n\nWhen the sheet is folded along the length, the new shape is a/2 by b. Perimeter is 2*(a/2 +b) =a +2b=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the new shape is a by b/2. Perimeter is 2*(a +b/2)=2a +b=66.\n\nSolving these gives a=28, b=10. Area=280 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut in the options, the closest is C)792. But 280*2.83 is about 792, but that's not a logical step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should multiply a and b by 6, but that would give 28*10 *36= 10080 cm\u00b2, which is not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the sheet is folded twice, but that's not what the problem says.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters given are the sum of both parts when folded. So, when folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48, so two parts have 96 cm. Similarly, when folded along the width, each part has 66, so two parts have 132 cm.\n\nSo:\n\nWhen folded along length (each part's perimeter is 48), total perimeter for both parts is 96=2*(a +2b) \u2192a +2b=48.\n\nWhen folded along width (each part's perimeter is 66), total perimeter is 132=2*(2a +b) \u21922a +b=66.\n\nSo same equations as before. So a=28, b=10. Area 280.\n\nNo, that doesn't fit.\n\nI think I've tried all possible approaches, and I can't find a way to get the area to match the given options. My conclusion is that the correct area is 280 cm\u00b2, but since this isn't an option, I might have made a mistake in my initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when folded along the length, the sheet's perimeter is 48 cm, and when folded along the width, it's 66 cm. But wait, the problem says each part has a perimeter, so perhaps the perimeters are 48 and 66 for each part when folded along each direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when the sheet is folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48, and when folded along the width, the perimeter of each part is 66. So, each part's perimeter is 48 and 66, respectively.\n\nWhich leads me back to the same equations.\n\nSo, with that, I think the correct answer based on my calculations is 280, but since it's not an option, I must have made a mistake. Perhaps the correct approach is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the sheet is folded along one direction, each part's perimeter is 48, which is the same as when folded along the other direction, each part's perimeter is 66. But that leads to the same equations as before.\n\nI think I have to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C)792, which is 280 * 2.828..., which is 280 * (sqrt(2)) approx. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should consider that when the sheet is folded, the dimensions are multiplied by 2. Wait, but that's not logical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet's dimensions are twice what I calculated. Because when I folded, I got L=28 and W=10. So 28*10=280. If I multiply each dimension by 3, for example, I get 84 and 30, giving area 2520, which isn't an option.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck and perhaps I should just go with the initial answer of 280, but it's not an option. So I'm likely missing something, but I can't figure it out. \n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the problem.\n\nLet me let the original dimensions be x and y.\n\nWhen folded along x, each part has dimensions x/2 and y. Perimeter=2*(x/2 + y)=x +2y=48.\n\nWhen folded along y, each part has dimensions x and y/2. Perimeter=2*(x + y/2)=2x +y=66.\n\nSolving:\n\nEquation 1: x +2y=48.\n\nEquation 2: 2x +y=66.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2: 2x +4y=96.\n\nSubtract equation 2: (2x +4y) - (2x + y)=96-66 \u21923y=30 \u2192y=10.\n\nThen x=48-20=28.\n\nOriginal area is x*y=28*10=280.\n\nStill, no option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeter when folding is 48 for both parts combined. So each part's perimeter is 24.\n\nSo:\n\nEquation 1: x +2y=24.\n\nEquation 2: 2x +y=33.\n\nSolving:\n\nEquation 1: x=24-2y.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: 2*(24-2y) +y=33 \u219248-4y +y=33 \u219248-3y=33 \u21923y=15 \u2192y=5.\n\nx=24-10=14.\n\nArea=14*5=70. Not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is 280, but it's not an option. Maybe the problem has a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I should choose the closest option, which isn't available.\n\nI think I'll have to conclude that the correct area is 280 cm\u00b2, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. But given the options, I'll have to choose the one that fits the equations I set up, which is 280, but it's not present. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)792, but I can't see how.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem states: when folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48 cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66 cm when folded along the other set of sides.\n\nSo each part has a perimeter of 48 when folded one way, and 66 when folded the other way.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that the perimeters are for each part, so when folded along one set, the perimeters are 48 for each part, and when folded along the other set, 66 for each part.\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\nWhen folded along x: each part's perimeter is 48 cm \u2192 2*(x/2 + y)=x+2y=48.\n\nWhen folded along y: each part's perimeter is 66 cm \u21922*(x + y/2)=2x +y=66.\n\nSolving these gives x=28, y=10.\n\nArea=280.\n\nBut not an option. So I'm stuck. I think the intended answer is 280, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the sheet as having length and width in a different way. Let me call length L and width W.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each part has perimeter 48: 2*(L/2 + W) =48 \u2192 L +2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part has perimeter 66: 2*(L + W/2)=66 \u21922L + W=66.\n\nSame equations. So no change.\n\nI think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is 280, but since it's not an option, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.\n\nBut given the options, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose the original sheet's length is L and width is W.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each part has dimensions L/2 and W. The perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) =L +2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part has dimensions L and W/2. The perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nLet me solve these equations again.\n\nEquation 1: L =48 -2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: 2*(48-2W) +W =66 \u219296 -4W +W=66 \u219296-3W=66 \u21923W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nL=48-20=28.\n\nArea=28*10=280.\n\nBut no option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters include the folded edge as an outer edge, which would change the equations.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each part's perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) + L \u2192 (L + 2W) + L= 2L+2W=48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, each part's perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) +W \u2192 (2L + W) +W=2L +2W=66.\n\nSo equations would be:\n\n2L +2W=48 \u2192 L + W=24.\n\n2L +2W=66 \u2192 L +W=33.\n\nBut 24=33 is impossible.\n\nSo that's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when folded along the length, each part's perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) + (L/2), which is the folded edge. So each part would have a perimeter of 2*(L/2 + W) + (L/2)= (L +2W) + (L/2)= (3L/2 +2W)=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part's perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) + (W/2)= (2L +W) + (W/2)=2L + (3W/2)=66.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n1) 3L/2 +2W=48.\n\n2) 2L + (3W/2)=66.\n\nLet me multiply equation 1 by 2 to eliminate fractions: 3L +4W=96.\n\nEquation 2 multiplied by 2:4L +3W=132.\n\nNow, let's solve:\n\nEquation 1:3L +4W=96.\n\nEquation 2:4L +3W=132.\n\nLet me use elimination.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 4 and equation 2 by3:\n\n12L +16W=384.\n\n12L +9W=396.\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n(12L +16W) - (12L +9W)=384-396 \u21927W= -12 \u2192 W= -12/7.\n\nNegative width doesn't make sense. So this approach is wrong.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possibilities. I must have made a mistake in the setup. But I can't find where. So I'll go with the initial answer of 280, but since it's not an option, perhaps the correct answer isn't provided. But since I need to choose from the options, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct area is 792, which is option C.\n\nWait, how?\n\nLet me think: 280 multiplied by 2.828 equals approximately 792. But that's sqrt(8) times, which is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the perimeters as being for the entire sheet after folding, which would be a/2 by b. So perimeter is 2*(a/2 +b)=48 \u2192a +2b=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the sheet's perimeter is 2*(a +b/2)=66 \u21922a +b=66.\n\nSolving:\n\nEquation 1: a=48-2b.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: 2*(48-2b) +b=66 \u219296-4b +b=66 \u219296-3b=66 \u21923b=30 \u2192b=10.\n\na=48-20=28.\n\nArea=28*10=280.\n\nNo, same result. So I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is 280, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is C)792, but I can't see how.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the area of a rectangular sheet based on the perimeters of its halves when folded along two different sets of sides.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a rectangular sheet and folding it into two equal halves. The question is about finding the area of the original sheet. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, so the sheet is rectangular. Let's say the length is L and the width is W. So, the area we're trying to find is L multiplied by W, right?\n\nThe problem says that when you fold the sheet into two equal halves, along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm. And when you fold it along the other set of sides, the perimeter is 66 cm. Wait, I need to visualize this.\n\nSo when you fold a rectangle along one set of sides, say along the length, you end up with two smaller rectangles. Each of these smaller rectangles will have dimensions. For example, if you fold along the length, each half would have a length of L/2 and the same width W. Alternatively, if you fold along the width, each half would have the same length L and width W/2.\n\nWait, but wait. The way folding works might be different. Let me clarify. If the original sheet is folded along its length (so the length is L, and the width is W), then when folded along its length, each half would have a length of L/2 and width W. So each part's perimeter would be based on these dimensions.\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. When you fold a rectangle along its length, you're bringing the two longer sides together. So the resulting shape is a rectangle with half the original length. So each half would have a length of L/2 and width W. So the perimeter of each half would be 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W. Because the formula for perimeter is 2*(length + width), right?\n\nSimilarly, when you fold along the width, you're halving the width. So each half has length L and width W/2. So the perimeter would be 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W.\n\nSo the problem states that when folded along one set, the perimeter is 48 cm, and when folded along the other set, it's 66 cm. So we have two equations:\n\nWhen folded along the length: perimeter = L + 2W = 48 cm. (Because each half is (L/2 and W), so perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W).\n\nWhen folded along the width: perimeter = 2L + W = 66 cm.\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1. L + 2W = 48\n2. 2L + W = 66\n\nWe need to solve for L and W. Hmm, maybe using substitution or elimination. Let's do elimination.\n\nLet me write the equations:\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W = 48\nEquation 2: 2L + W = 66\n\nWe can try to solve for one variable. Let's try to eliminate one variable. Let's multiply Equation 1 by 2 so that we can subtract equations to eliminate L:\n\nEquation 1 * 2: 2L + 4W = 96\nEquation 2: 2L + W = 66\n\nSubtract Equation 2 from Equation 1*2:\n\n(2L +4W) - (2L + W) = 96 -66\nWhich is 0L +3W = 30 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nNow plug W=10 into Equation 1:\n\nL + 2*(10) =48 \u2192 L +20=48 \u2192 L=28.\n\nSo the original sheet is 28 cm by 10 cm. Then the area is L*W =28*10=280 cm\u00b2. Wait, but looking at the options, the numbers are much larger: 1584, 1120, etc. Did I mess up somewhere?\n\nWait a minute, wait. Oh no, wait! Maybe I misunderstood the problem. Because when you fold the sheet into two equal halves, are the perimeters of each part as a whole being considered, or each part's perimeter when folded? Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says, \"folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I got that wrong. Because when you fold along the length, each half is a rectangle, so the perimeter is for each half. So each half has a perimeter of 48 cm. Similarly, when folded along the width, each half has a perimeter of 66 cm.\n\nWait, but no. Let me think: the total when you fold along, say, the length, you have two sheets each with perimeter 48 cm. Or is the perimeter when folded, meaning the entire folded sheet? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that when the sheet is folded along one pair of sides, the perimeter of each folded part is 48 cm. Since it's folded into two equal halves, each half is a smaller rectangle, and each has a perimeter of 48 cm. Similarly, when folded the other way, each half has a perimeter of 66 cm.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. If the sheet is folded along its length, each half is (L/2, W). So each of the two parts has perimeter 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W. So the perimeter per part is L + 2W = 48 cm. Similarly, when folded along its width, each part is (L, W/2), so perimeter per part is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W = 66 cm.\n\nSo the equations are as I set them before. So L +2W=48 and 2L + W=66. Which gives L=28, W=10. Area is 280 cm\u00b2. But that's not one of the options. Hmm, so I'm doing something wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe I have the perimeters of the folded parts wrong. Let me re-examine. When you fold a sheet along one of its sides, the resulting shape is a rectangle, but perhaps the perimeter includes the folded edge. Wait, but when you fold a sheet into two, each part is a separate rectangle. So each would have their own perimeter, which is what I thought.\n\nWait, but maybe I have the perimeter calculation wrong. Let me think again. Suppose the original sheet is L by W. When folded along the length (so along the longer side), each half is L/2 by W. But when folded, the perimeters could be different because the folded edge is a new edge. Wait, no, because the perimeter is the total boundary of each individual part. So each part is a rectangle, so their perimeters are 2*(length + width). So for each part when folded along the length, the dimensions are L/2 and W, so perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W=48. Similarly, when folded along the width, each part is L by W/2, so perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)= 2L + W=66. So the equations are correct.\n\nWait, so perhaps the problem is in the way I'm interpreting the perimeter. Let me think again. When you fold a sheet along one of its sides, you're bringing two edges together, but the resulting sheet's perimeter is different. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the perimeter of the folded sheet as a whole, not each half. Oh! Because if you fold a sheet into two parts, you're making a folded shape, perhaps the perimeter of that folded sheet is what's being considered.\n\nWait, that might make more sense. Because if you fold along one side, the folded sheet (i.e., the two parts together) would have a perimeter that's half of the original plus some other edges. Or maybe the perimeter of the folded sheet is being considered as a single piece, not each individual part.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the perimeters are of each individual half or the entire folded sheet. Let me try to re-examine the problem.\n\nThe problem says, \"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides.\"\n\nAh, perhaps I misread it. Maybe each part (each of the two halves) when folded along one set has a perimeter of 48 cm. So each half is a rectangle with perimeter 48 cm. So two equations as I set before.\n\nBut that leads to L=28, W=10, area 280, which isn't an option. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the entire folded sheet when folded, meaning that when you fold a sheet along its length, the resulting shape is a rectangle of dimensions L/2 by W. But wait, no, the folded sheet would have the same area, but perhaps a different perimeter. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the perimeter is of the folded sheet as a single piece. So, when you fold along the length, the resulting sheet is folded, so the perimeter is that of the folded shape. For example, if the original sheet is L by W, after folding along the length, each half is L/2 by W. So the folded sheet is two layers of L/2 by W, but as a single sheet, it's L/2 by W with a thickness, but in terms of perimeter, perhaps it's just the same as each half.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps when you fold along the length, the sheet becomes a rectangle that's (L/2) by W, but the perimeter would be the same as each half, which would be 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W=48 cm. Similarly for the other direction.\n\nBut again, that brings me back to L=28 and W=10, which doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I've made a mistake.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the perimeters refer to the combined perimeters. Let's say, when you fold along one side, the two parts are each a rectangle, and together, their perimeters add up to the original plus some. But that's not what the problem says. The problem says each part has a perimeter of 48 cm when folded along one set, and 66 cm when folded along the other.\n\nHmm, maybe the perimeters are for the folded sheet as a single piece. Let me think: when you fold a sheet along its length, the resulting shape is a rectangle with dimensions L/2 by W. The perimeter of that single folded sheet is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48. Similarly, when you fold along the width, the folded sheet is L by W/2, so perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W=66. So that's the same as before.\n\nBut then, solving gives L=28, W=10, area 280. But the options are all in the thousands. So I must have messed up somewhere. What's wrong here?\n\nWait a minute, maybe the sheet is folded along the longer side, but perhaps the perimeter is measured differently. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps when the sheet is folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, the perimeter is the sum of all the outer edges. For instance, if you fold along the length, you're bringing the two length sides together, so the folded sheet's perimeter would be the sum of the widths and the folded edges. Wait, perhaps not. Let me draw a mental picture.\n\nImagine a standard sheet of paper. When you fold it along its length (long side), you create a crease along the middle of the length. Now, the resulting folded sheet has a perimeter that includes the two widths and the two folded edges. Wait, but the folded edges are along the length, so perhaps the perimeter becomes 2*(W + (L/2)).\n\nWait, but that's the same as each half's perimeter. So 2*(W + L/2) = 2W + L.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, when folded along one set, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. So that would be 2*(W + L/2) = 48 \u2192 2W + L =48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the other set, each part's perimeter is 66 cm. So 2*(L + W/2)=66 \u2192 2L + W=66.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n1. L + 2W = 48 ? No, wait, wait. No, wait, from 2*(W + L/2) equals 48. So 2*(W + L/2) =48 \u2192 2W + L =48.\n\nSimilarly, 2*(L + W/2)=66 \u2192 2L + W=66.\n\nAh! So the two equations are:\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W =48 \u2192 from 2*(W + L/2)=48 \u2192 2W + L=48 \u2192 same as L + 2W=48.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W=66.\n\nSo you have:\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W =48\nEquation 2: 2L + W=66\n\nSo solving these, let's subtract or use substitution.\n\nLet me solve Equation 1 for L: L=48-2W.\n\nSubstitute into Equation 2:\n\n2*(48-2W) + W=66 \u2192 96 -4W + W=66 \u2192 96 -3W=66 \u2192 -3W=66-96 \u2192 -3W=-30 \u2192 W =10.\n\nThen L=48-2*10=28.\n\nSo the original sheet is 28 cm by 10 cm. Area is 28*10=280 cm\u00b2. But the options are way larger. Hmm.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in understanding the folding. Because when you fold along the length, perhaps the resulting sheet's perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W), which is L + 2W=48. Alternatively, maybe the folded sheet is treated as a single piece, which would have a perimeter of 2*(L/2 + W + L/2) \u2192 no, that's the same as the original perimeter, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when you fold the sheet into two, the perimeter of each part is the sum of three sides and the folded edge. Oh! Because when you fold it, one of the sides is now internal. So perhaps each half has a perimeter that's three sides plus the folded edge. Wait, that might change things.\n\nWait, let me think: If you have a rectangle of L by W. When you fold it along the length, each half is L/2 by W. But when folded, the two halves are connected along the length, so perhaps the perimeter of each half is three sides: length (L/2) and width (W), and the other side (W), but the folded edge is internal. Wait, but each half is a separate rectangle, so each has four sides, but when folded, maybe the folded edge is not part of the perimeter because it's internal. No, perhaps the perimeter of each half when folded is two times (L/2 + W), but perhaps the folded edge is not part of the perimeter.\n\nWait, no, each half is a separate rectangle. The folded edge is an internal edge between the two halves, so each half has the same perimeter as before. So perhaps my initial approach is correct.\n\nBut I'm not getting the right answer, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think of the problem differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about the perimeters of each half, but the perimeters of the folded sheet as a whole. So when you fold the sheet along one set of sides, the folded sheet is a rectangle that's half as long and the same width, so the perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W ), which would be L + 2W. And the problem says this equals 48 cm. Similarly, when folded along the other direction, the perimeter is 2*( L + (W/2) ) = 2L + W=66 cm.\n\nSo same equations as before: L +2W=48 and 2L + W=66. Solving these:\n\nFrom equation 1: L=48-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n2*(48-2W) + W =66 \u2192 96 -4W + W=66 \u2192 96-3W=66 \u2192 -3W= -30 \u2192 W=10. So L=48-20=28.\n\nArea is 28*10=280 cm\u00b2. But again, the options don't have that. So what's wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I have the perimeters backwards. Maybe the perimeters are the other way around. Let me check\u2014if when folded along the length, the perimeter is 66, and when folded along the width, it's 48.\n\nSo equations would be:\n\n1. L +2W=66\n2. 2L + W=48\n\nLet me solve these.\n\nFrom equation 1: L=66-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n2*(66-2W) + W =48 \u2192 132 -4W + W=48 \u2192 132-3W=48 \u2192 -3W=48-132 \u2192 -3W= -84 \u2192 W=28.\n\nThen L=66 -2*(28)=66-56=10.\n\nSo L=10, W=28. So the area is 10*28=280, same as before.\n\nHmm. So no, that doesn't solve the problem. The area is still 280, which isn't among the options.\n\nWait, maybe the perimeters are for the folded sheet as a single piece, but including the folded edge as part of the perimeter. Wait, that doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps when you fold the sheet into two equal parts, the perimeter of each part (when considered as a single folded sheet) would be the sum of the outer edges, which might include some internal edges. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the perimeters of the two folded sheets add up to the original perimeter plus something. But I don't know.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when you fold the sheet, the perimeters of each half include the folded edge as part of the perimeter. But that wouldn't make sense because the folded edge is internal.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the sheet is folded causes the perimeters to include additional edges. Let me think: when you fold along the length, each part is a rectangle of L/2 x W, but perhaps the folded edge adds another L/2 to the perimeter. Wait, no, because the fold is along the length, the two parts are connected along that length, so each part's perimeter is just the sum of the other three sides. So each half would have a perimeter of (L/2) + 2W. So 2*( (L/2) + W )= L + 2W=48.\n\nSame as before. So this approach isn't working.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the perimeters. Let me think differently: if the sheet is folded along the length, each half is a rectangle of L/2 by W. So each half's perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each half is L by W/2, so perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSo the equations are correct. Therefore, the area is 280 cm\u00b2. But none of the options match that.\n\nWait, perhaps the units are in meters instead of centimeters? No, the options are 1584, etc., which would be meters squared if the original was in cm, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me think: perhaps the perimeters are for the folded sheet as a single piece, but when you fold along the length, the sheet is folded into two parts, each of size L/2 x W. But the folded sheet's perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48 cm.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, the folded sheet is size L x W/2, so perimeter 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66 cm.\n\nSo the same equations as before. So perhaps the problem is that the area is 280 cm\u00b2, but the options don't have that. So maybe I've misread the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says \"folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides.\"\n\nAh! Wait a second. Maybe the perimeters are for the two parts combined. So when folded along one set, the total perimeter for both parts is 48 cm. But that seems unlikely because the two parts would have their own perimeters, which would add up to more than the original.\n\nWait, but let me think, if each part has a perimeter of 48 when folded along one side, then when you fold along that side, each part has a perimeter of 48. So two parts, each with perimeter 48: but that would mean the total perimeter of both parts is 96 cm. But that's not necessarily the same as the original sheet's perimeter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the perimeter of the folded sheet as a single piece, which could be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when the sheet is folded along one length, the perimeter of the folded sheet is 48 cm. So the folded sheet is a rectangle of L/2 by W, so perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W)= L + 2W=48 cm.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, the folded sheet is L by W/2, so perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66 cm.\n\nSo the equations are L + 2W=48 and 2L + W=66.\n\nSolving these:\n\nMultiply the first equation by 2:\n\n2L +4W =96 \u2192 equation 3.\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 3:\n\n(2L +4W) - (2L + W) =96\u221266 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nSubstitute W=10 into equation 1: L +20=48 \u2192 L=28.\n\nBut as before, area is 280 cm\u00b2, which isn't an option.\n\nSo I must be making a mistake. Let me try to see if I can get an area that's in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the equations reversed. Let me think:\n\nSuppose when folded along the length, the perimeter is 66, and along the width, it's 48. So equations would be:\n\n1. L +2W=66\n2. 2L + W=48.\n\nSolving:\n\nFrom equation 1: L=66\u22122W.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: 2*(66\u22122W) + W=48 \u2192 132\u22124W + W=48 \u2192 132\u22123W=48 \u2192 \u22123W=\u221284 \u2192 W=28.\n\nThen L=66\u22122*28=66\u221256=10.\n\nArea is 10*28=280 cm\u00b2. Still same as before.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. None of the options match, so I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded along the longer side, but the perimeters are of the whole sheet after folding, including the crease.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the original sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeters are of those parts when they are unfolded again. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded such that the perimeters of the two parts include the folded edge. For example, when folded along the length, each part has dimensions L/2 \u00d7 W, and the perimeter includes the folded edge as part of the perimeter. So each part would have a perimeter of 2*(L/2 + W + L/2) = 2*(L + W) = 2L + 2W. But that would be the same as the original perimeter, which is 2(L + W).\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then when folded along the length, each part's perimeter would be 2(L + W) =48 cm, implying that 2(L + W)=48 \u2192 L+W=24.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, each part's perimeter would be 2(L + W)=66 cm, which would imply L + W=33.\n\nBut that's impossible because L + W can't be both 24 and 33. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are measured differently when folded. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe when you fold the sheet along one set of sides, the resulting sheet has a perimeter that is the sum of the original perimeter minus the folded edges. Let me think.\n\nWait, the original perimeter is 2(L + W). When you fold along the length, the perimeter reduces by 2L (since the two lengths are now internal) and adds 2*(L/2) for the new edges. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeter when folded is 2*(W) + 2*(L/2) ) = 2W + L. Which is the same as the previous approach, so 2W + L=48.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the perimeters when folded are for the entire sheet as a single folded piece, not individual parts. So, when you fold along the length, you have a folded sheet with dimensions L/2 by W, so perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W=48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, sheet is L by W/2, so perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)= 2L + W=66.\n\nSo same equations as before, leading to L=28 and W=10, area 280. But the options don't have that.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the perimeters are for each part after folding, but including the folded edge in the perimeter. Which may not make sense, but just trying.\n\nSo when folded along the length, each part is L/2 x W, but the folded edge is a new edge. So the perimeter would be 2*(L/2) + 2*W + L (the folded edge)? That would be L + 2W + L = 2L + 2W=48. So equation 1: 2L + 2W=48 \u2192 L + W=24.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is L x W/2, so perimeter would be 2*L + 2*(W/2) + W = 2L + W + W=2L + 2W=66. So equation 2: 2L +2W=66 \u2192 L + W=33.\n\nBut L + W can't be 24 and 33 at the same time. So that's impossible. So that approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the perimeters as adding the folded edge. So when you fold along the length, each part's perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) + L (the folded edge). So 2*(L/2 + W) + L= L + 2W + L = 2L + 2W=48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, each part's perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) + W = 2L + W + W= 2L + 2W=66.\n\nSo, same as before, leading to L + W=24 and L +W=33, which is impossible.\n\nSo, that approach is not working.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the initial approach is correct, but the options are wrong? Or perhaps the problem is intended to have the sheet folded into two parts, but the perimeters are those of the two parts together. Like, when folded along one side, the two parts together have a perimeter of 48 cm. But that would mean the folded sheet's perimeter is 48 cm, which is what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when folded along one pair of sides, the entire sheet's perimeter is 48 cm, and when folded along the other, it's 66 cm. So perhaps each fold reduces the perimeter, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the original sheet's perimeter is 2(L + W). When folded along the length, the sheet's perimeter becomes 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W=48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, the perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)= 2L + W=66.\n\nSo again, the same equations: L +2W=48 and 2L + W=66.\n\nWhich gives L=28 and W=10, area 280.\n\nBut the options are way larger. So perhaps I'm missing a multiplication factor somewhere.\n\nWait, wait. Maybe the perimeters are of the two parts together. So when you fold along the length, the two parts together form a folded sheet, but their combined perimeters would be 2*(each part's perimeter).\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each part is a square? No, the problem says rectangular.\n\nWait, I'm stuck. Let me think: perhaps the problem is that when folding along one set, the perimeter is 48, which is the perimeter of each part, so two parts would have a combined perimeter of 96. But the original sheet's perimeter is 2(L + W). So 96=2(L + W) \u2192 L+W=48. Similarly, when folded along the other set, each part's perimeter is 66, so two parts: 132=2(L + W) \u2192 L+W=66. But that's impossible because L+W can't be both 48 and 66.\n\nSo that approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when folded along one side, the combined perimeter is 48, and when along the other, it's 66.\n\nSo the original sheet's perimeter when folded in either way is either 48 or 66. So:\n\nWhen folded along length, the perimeter is 48: L + 2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along width, perimeter is 66: 2L + W=66.\n\nWhich again gives L=28, W=10, area 280, not matching options.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are of the two parts after folding, but each part is considered as a separate rectangle. So if you fold a sheet into two, each has a perimeter, and the sum of both perimeters is the original perimeter plus twice the length of the fold. Because when you fold, you're adding the fold line as a new edge for both parts.\n\nAh! That might be it. Let me explore this.\n\nWhen you fold the sheet along the length, each part is a rectangle of L/2 \u00d7 W. Each part has a perimeter of 2*(L/2 + W)=L + 2W. Since there are two parts, the total perimeter for both is 2*(L + 2W) =2L +4W. But the original sheet's perimeter is 2(L + W). So the sum of the perimeters of the two parts is 2L +4W= 2(L + 2W). And the original perimeter is 2(L + W). So the difference is 2(L + 2W) - 2(L + W) = 2W. So the sum of the perimeters is original perimeter plus 2W.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when folded along one set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. So two parts, each 48 cm, sum to 96 cm. But the original perimeter plus 2W would be 2(L + W) +2W= 2L +4W =96.\n\nSo equation: 2L +4W=96 \u2192 L + 2W=48.\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the other set, each part's perimeter is 66 cm, so two parts sum to 132 cm. Thus, the sum is 2L + W= 66 each \u2192 sum is 132=2*(2L + W)= 4L + 2W.\n\nWait, no, perhaps each part's perimeter is 66 when folded along the width, so two parts sum to 132 cm. So 2*(2L + W)=132 \u2192 2L + W=66.\n\nWhich brings us back to the same equations.\n\nSo the calculations are correct, but the area is 280, which is not among the options. So perhaps the problem is in the way the perimeters are considered.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters given in the problem are for the folded sheet as a single piece, not each half. So when you fold along the length, the folded sheet has a perimeter of 48 cm, and when folded along the width, it's 66 cm.\n\nSo, when folded along the length, the sheet's dimensions are L/2 by W, so perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W)= L + 2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, dimensions are L by W/2, perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSo again, same equations, leading to L=28, W=10, area 280.\n\nBut options don't have that. So I'm really stuck. Maybe the problem has a typo, but I have to choose from the given options.\n\nWait, let me think of the problem differently. Maybe the sheet is folded both ways, and the perimeters are for the same sheet when folded in either direction. But I don't think that's the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is being folded into two parts, but the perimeters given are for the entire original sheet after being folded in either way. That can't be, because the sheet's perimeter would be the same regardless of folding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when you fold the sheet into two, the perimeters of the two parts add up to something. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the sheet when folded into two parts, but the sheet is folded in such a way that it's halved along both dimensions. Wait, that would create four parts, but the problem says two equal halves.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the initial approach, but perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, let me try to write the equations again.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each part has perimeter 48 cm. So 2*(L/2 + W)=48 \u2192 L + 2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part has perimeter 66 cm. So 2*(L + W/2)=66 \u2192 2L + W=66.\n\nSo equations:\n\n1. L + 2W =48\n2. 2L + W =66\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2: 2L +4W=96 \u2192 equation 3.\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 3: (2L +4W) - (2L + W)=96\u221266 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nThen L=48\u22122*10=28.\n\nArea is 28*10=280 cm\u00b2. But none of the options match.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the problem is that the sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeters are for the entire folded sheet as a single piece. So when folded along the length, the sheet becomes L/2 x W, so perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W)= L +2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, it's L x W/2, perimeter 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSo same equations. So perhaps the area is 280, but none of the options match. I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the area is 280, but the options are in square meters? No, the options are 1584, which would be way too big.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I messed up the equations.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps when the sheet is folded along one set, the resulting sheet has a perimeter of 48 cm, and when folded along the other, 66 cm. So:\n\nCase 1: Folded along length \u2192 dimensions L/2 \u00d7 W \u2192 perimeter 2*(L/2 + W)=L + 2W=48.\n\nCase 2: Folded along width \u2192 dimensions L \u00d7 W/2 \u2192 perimeter 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSo equations again: L +2W=48, 2L + W=66.\n\nSame solution: W=10, L=28. Area 280.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the perimeters are for the entire sheet after being folded into two parts, but including the new edges. For example, when you fold along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm, which includes the folded edge. So each part's perimeter would be 2*(L/2 + W) + L (the folded edge). So 2*(L/2 + W) + L= L + 2W + L=2L +2W=48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, each part's perimeter would be 2*(L + W/2) + W= 2L + W + W=2L + 2W=66.\n\nSo equations:\n\n1. 2L +2W=48 \u2192 L + W=24.\n2. 2L + 2W=66 \u2192 L + W=33.\n\nBut that's impossible because L + W can't be both 24 and 33. So that approach is wrong.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possibilities, and the only conclusion is that the area is 280, but it's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try once more.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the perimeters are for the folded sheet as a single piece when folded along both length and width. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe the sheet is folded both ways, but each fold is along different sides, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sheet is folded into four parts, but I don't think that's the case.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the perimeters when folded are for the entire sheet, but including the folded edges. For example, when folded along the length, the sheet's perimeter is 48, which includes two L/2 and two W, plus the folded edge.\n\nBut that would make the perimeter 2*(L/2 + W) + L = L + 2W + L = 2L + 2W=48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, the perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) + W=2L + W + W=2L + 2W=66.\n\nSo equations:\n\n1. 2L +2W=48 \u2192 L + W=24.\n2. 2L + 2W=66 \u2192 L +W=33.\n\nWhich is impossible. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeters are for each part, but the perimeters are measured as the sum of all outer edges, including the folded edge.\n\nSo when folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 2*(L/2 + W) + L = 2*(L/2 + W) + L \u2192 Wait, no, that would be 2*(L/2 + W) + L = 2*(L/2 + W) + L = L + 2W + L=2L + 2W.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before, leading to impossible equations.\n\nI'm stuck. I think the only way this makes sense is that the initial approach is correct, and the area is 280, but it's not among the options. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, perhaps when the sheet is folded into two equal halves, the perimeters of the two parts together are 48 and 66. So when folded along length, the two parts have a combined perimeter of 48, and when folded along width, 66.\n\nSo, when folded along the length, each part has perimeter 48/2=24 cm. Wait, but that would make the equations different.\n\nWait, perhaps each part's perimeter is 48 cm when folded along one set, and 66 cm when folded along the other. So:\n\nEquation 1: L +2W=48 (each part's perimeter when folded along length)\nEquation 2: 2L + W=66 (each part's perimeter when folded along width)\n\nSo same equations as before. So I think I have to conclude that the correct area is 280, but since it's not an option, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I swapped the perimeters. Let me try:\n\nEquation 1: 2L + W=48\nEquation 2: L +2W=66.\n\nSolving:\n\nFrom equation 1: W=48\u22122L.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: L +2*(48\u22122L)=66 \u2192 L +96\u22124L=66 \u2192 -3L= -30 \u2192 L=10.\n\nThen W=48\u221220=28.\n\nArea is 10 *28=280. Still same.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I need to choose the closest option, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, let me check the calculations again.\n\nEquations:\n\nL + 2W =48 \u2192 equation 1.\n\n2L + W =66 \u2192 equation 2.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2: 2L +4W=96.\n\nSubtract equation 2: (2L+4W) - (2L + W)=96\u221266 \u21923W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nThen L=48\u221220=28.\n\nArea is 28*10=280 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the options provided must have the correct one. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the perimeters when folded are for the entire sheet plus the fold. For example, when folded along the length, the sheet's perimeter is 48 cm. So the sheet is folded, and now the perimeter includes the folded edge.\n\nWait, but when you fold a sheet along the length, the sheet's dimensions are L/2 \u00d7 W, but the folded edge is along the length. So the perimeter would be 2*(L/2 + W) \u2192 same as before.\n\nI think I've exhausted all options, and I must conclude that the area is 280 cm\u00b2, which is not among the options. So perhaps the problem has a typo, but given the options, I think I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the sheet as being folded into two parts, but the perimeters are for the combined sheet. Let me think: when folded along the length, the sheet is L/2 \u00d7 W, so perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W)=L +2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the sheet is L \u00d7 W/2, so perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations.\n\nWait, perhaps the area is 280, and the options are in square meters, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I should express the area in square meters, so 280 cm\u00b2 is 0.028 m\u00b2, but that's not matching any option.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me try solving the equations again.\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W =48 \u2192 multiply by 2: 2L +4W=96.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W=66.\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 1: (2L +4W) - (2L + W) =96-66 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10 cm.\n\nThen L=48\u22122*10=28 cm.\n\nArea: 28 *10=280 cm\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the units, but the options are in square meters. So 280 cm\u00b2 = 0.028 m\u00b2, but that's not matching any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the area in square meters, and I've solved in centimeters. Let me see: 28 cm is 0.28 m, 10 cm is 0.1 m. Area is 0.28 * 0.1=0.028 m\u00b2=28000 cm\u00b2. No, that's not matching any option.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but among the options given, perhaps I should pick based on another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the perimeters are for the entire sheet when folded into four parts, but that complicates things further.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the sheet is folded twice, along both length and width, resulting in four parts, each with a certain perimeter. But the problem states it's folded into two equal halves, so probably not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the folded sheets when both dimensions are halved, but that's not mentioned.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the sheet is folded into two parts along one set, each part's perimeter is 48, and when folded along the other set, the same each part's perimeter is 66. So perhaps each part's perimeter when folded along length is 48, and when folded along width is 66.\n\nBut that would imply that each part has two different perimeters, which doesn't make sense unless the parts are being folded in both directions.\n\nI think I've tried every possible approach I can think of, but I'm not getting an area that matches any of the options. So perhaps the problem is intended to have the equations set up differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should assume that when folded along the length, the sheet's perimeter becomes 48 cm, which is for the entire sheet, and when folded along the width, the perimeter is 66 cm. So:\n\nWhen folded along length: dimensions L/2 \u00d7 W \u2192 perimeter = 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along width: dimensions L \u00d7 W/2 \u2192 perimeter=2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSo same equations as before. So perhaps the answer is not among the options. But since I have to choose, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two equal parts, but not along the length or width. Perhaps folding along the diagonal. But that would complicate the shape into a triangle, which is not a rectangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts along the width, making each part a rectangle of L \u00d7 W/2, so each has a perimeter of 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the length, each part is L/2 \u00d7 W, perimeter=2*(L/2 + W)=L + 2W=48.\n\nSo same equations.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct area is 280, but since it's not an option, I might have to reevaluate.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the perimeters are for the two parts combined, not each part.\n\nIf when folded along length, the two parts together have a perimeter of 48 cm.\n\nThen each part's perimeter would be 24 cm.\n\nSo equation for each part when folded along length: 2*(L/2 + W)=24 \u2192 L + 2W=24.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along width, the two parts have a combined perimeter of 66 cm, so each part has 33 cm.\n\nEquation: 2*(L + W/2)=33 \u2192 2L + W=33.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n1. L + 2W=24\n2. 2L + W=33.\n\nSolving:\n\nFrom equation 1: L=24-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: 2*(24-2W) + W=33 \u219248 -4W +W=33 \u219248-3W=33 \u2192-3W= -15 \u2192 W=5.\n\nThen L=24-10=14.\n\nArea=14*5=70 cm\u00b2. Not among the options.\n\nSo that approach is also wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters when folded are for the two parts combined.\n\nSo, when folded along the length, the two parts have a combined perimeter of 48 cm.\n\nBut each part's perimeter is 24 cm.\n\nSo each part's dimensions after folding along length: L/2 \u00d7 W.\n\nPerimeter: 2*(L/2 + W)= L + 2W=24.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along width, each part's perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=33.\n\nSo again, same equations, leading to L=14, W=5, area 70. Still not matching.\n\nI think I've tried everything, but I'm not finding a solution that matches any of the options provided. Perhaps the intended approach was different, but I can't see it. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to go with the initial conclusion, but I'm not confident.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the area of a rectangular sheet based on its perimeters when folded into two equal halves along two different sets of sides. Let the length and width of the sheet be \\( L \\) and \\( W \\), respectively. The key steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Equations Setup**:  \n   - When folded along the length, each half has dimensions \\( \\frac{L}{2} \\times W \\), and the perimeter is given as 48 cm. This gives the equation:  \n     \\[\n     2 \\left( \\frac{L}{2} + W \\right) = 48 \\implies L + 2W = 48\n     \\]\n   - When folded along the width, each half has dimensions \\( L \\times \\frac{W}{2} \\), and the perimeter is given as 66 cm. This gives the equation:  \n     \\[\n     2 \\left( L + \\frac{W}{2} \\right) = 66 \\implies 2L + W = 66\n     \\]\n\n2. **Solving the Equations**:  \n   - From the first equation:  \n     \\[\n     L = 48 - 2W\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( L = 48 - 2W \\) into the second equation:  \n     \\[\n     2(48 - 2W) + W = 66 \\implies 96 - 4W + W = 66 \\implies 96 - 3W = 66 \\implies 3W = 30 \\implies W = 10\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( W = 10 \\) back into \\( L = 48 - 2W \\):  \n     \\[\n     L = 48 - 2(10) = 28\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Area**:  \n   The area of the rectangular sheet is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = L \\times W = 28 \\times 10 = 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Mismatch with Options**:  \n   The calculated area of \\( 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\) does not match any of the provided options (\\( 1584, 1120, 792, 1320, 1200 \\)). Despite multiple attempts to re-express the equations or consider alternative interpretations, the result remains consistent. It is possible that the problem contains a typo or the options are incorrect.\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct area is \\( 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\), but since this is not among the options, the problem may require further clarification.\n\n**Answer: None of the provided options are correct.**",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangular sheet of paper. When folded along one set of sides, each half has a perimeter of 48 cm. When folded along the other set, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm. I need to find the area of the original sheet.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So the sheet is a rectangle, which means it has length and width, let's say length L and width W.\n\nWhen you fold a rectangle into two equal halves along one set of sides, you're essentially halving one of the dimensions. Let me think: if you fold along the length, then each half would have a width of W/2. Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me visualize this.\n\nSuppose the rectangle is L (length) by W (width). If you fold it along the length, then each half would have a dimension of L/2 by W. Or wait, wait. No, wait. Folding along one set of sides... Oh, wait, no. Folding the rectangle along its length would mean you're bringing the two ends together along the length. So, perhaps the resulting shape is a smaller rectangle.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as cutting along the length or the width. Oh right, because when you fold along one set of sides, you're halving that dimension. So, for example, if you fold along the length, each part becomes a rectangle of (L/2) by W. Similarly, if you fold along the width, each part is (W/2) by L.\n\nSo, the perimeters when folded along each direction are given as 48 cm and 66 cm.\n\nSo let's set up the equations.\n\nCase 1: Folding along the length.\n\nEach half is (L/2) by W. The perimeter of each half would be 2*( (L/2) + W ). And that's given as 48 cm.\n\nSo equation 1: 2*( (L/2) + W ) = 48.\n\nSimplify that: 2*(L/2 + W) = 48 \u2192 (L + 2W) = 48.\n\nWait, no: Wait, 2*( (L/2) + W ) = 2*(L/2) + 2*W = L + 2W. So equation 1 is L + 2W = 48.\n\nCase 2: Folding along the width.\n\nEach half is (W/2) by L. So the perimeter is 2*( (W/2) + L ).\n\nThis is given as 66 cm.\n\nSo equation 2: 2*( (W/2) + L ) = 66 \u2192 simplifying, 2*(W/2 + L) = W + 2L = 66.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) L + 2W = 48.\n\n2) 2L + W = 66. Wait, no, the second equation is W + 2L =66.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nIn case 2, the perimeter is 2*( (W/2) + L ) = 2*(W/2 + L ) = 2*( (W + 2L)/2 )= W + 2L = 66.\n\nSo equation 2 is W + 2L = 66.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W =48.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W =66.\n\nWait, wait, no, no. Equation 2 is W + 2L =66.\n\nSo, equations:\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W =48.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W =66.\n\nWait, no, equation 2 is W + 2L =66, which can be written as 2L + W =66.\n\nSo now, I have a system of two equations:\n\n1) L + 2W =48.\n\n2) 2L + W =66.\n\nI can solve this using substitution or elimination.\n\nLet me use elimination. Let's multiply equation 1 by 2 to make the coefficients of L the same.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2: 2L +4W =96.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W =66.\n\nNow subtract equation 2 from this new equation:\n\n(2L +4W) - (2L + W) =96 -66.\n\n2L +4W -2L - W=30 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nNow plug W=10 into equation 1: L + 2*(10) =48 \u2192 L +20=48 \u2192 L=28.\n\nSo the original rectangle is 28 cm by 10 cm. Its area is L*W=28*10=280 cm\u00b2.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the numbers are way higher. Oh wait, no, the options are A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200.\n\nWait, 280 isn't among the options. Hmm. So I must have made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I misunderstood how the folding affects the dimensions. Let me re-examine the setup.\n\nWhen the sheet is folded along one set of sides, say along the length, each half would have dimensions L/2 and W. But wait, the perimeter would be 2*( (L/2) + W ). Let me re-calculate that.\n\nWait, if the sheet is folded along the length, the resulting rectangle is (L/2) by W. So the perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W ) = 2*( L/2 + W ) = L + 2W.\n\nWhich is what I had before. So equation 1 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, each part is (W/2) by L. Perimeter is 2*( (W/2) + L ) = W + 2L.\n\nSo equation 2 is correct. So the equations are correct, and solving gives L=28, W=10. Area is 280, which isn't an option. So I must have messed up the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the dimensions flipped. Maybe when folding along the length, the other dimension is W, but perhaps the length and width are swapped.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the initial approach differently.\n\nWait another approach: Let me denote the original rectangle as length L and width W.\n\nWhen folded along the length (so the length is halved), each half is (L/2) by W. So the perimeter of each is 2*( (L/2) + W )= L + 2W. But the problem says this is 48. So equation 1 holds.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each half is (W/2) by L. So perimeter is 2*( (W/2) + L )= W + 2L. Which is 66. So equation 2.\n\nSo equations:\n\n1) L + 2W =48.\n\n2) 2L + W =66.\n\nWait, wait, no, equation 2 is W + 2L =66.\n\nWait, but solving:\n\nEquation 1: L = 48 - 2W.\n\nPlug into equation 2:\n\nW + 2*(48 - 2W) =66 \u2192 W +96 -4W =66 \u2192 -3W +96=66 \u2192 -3W= -30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nThen L=48-2*10=28.\n\nSo the sheet is 28 cm by 10 cm. Area is 280 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut the options don't include 280. So perhaps I made a mistake in the folding direction.\n\nWait another way: Maybe when folded along one set of sides, the length becomes W and width becomes L/2, or something else.\n\nWait, maybe I should label length and width differently. For example, perhaps the longer side is L and the shorter is W. So when folded along the longer side, the perimeter changes.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose the sheet is folded along the length (so the length is halved). Then each part is (L/2) by W. So the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is (W/2) by L. So perimeter is 2*(W/2 + L) = W + 2L=66.\n\nSo same equations, same solution, same problem.\n\nWait, maybe the perimeters are of the folded sheet, but perhaps the folded sheet is not just one half. Oh wait, no, the question says when folded into two equal halves, each part when folded along one set of sides has a perimeter of 48, same for 66.\n\nWait, if the sheet is folded along the length, each part is (L/2) by W and has perimeter 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nIf the sheet is folded along the width, each part is (W/2) by L and has perimeter 2*(W/2 + L) = W + 2L=66.\n\nSo equations are correct.\n\nWait, but the area is 280, which is not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeter is for the entire folded sheet (both halves). Oh wait, the question says 'each part' when folded. Oh, wait, the problem says when folded into two equal halves, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm when folded along one set and 66 when along the other.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. When folded along one set, it's folded into two parts, each part is a rectangle. So each of the two parts has a perimeter of 48 cm.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Because if you fold a sheet into two, you might be creating a single folded piece, not two separate parts. But the question says 'each part' when folded along one set of sides.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is about whether the perimeter is of the entire folded shape or each half.\n\nWait, the question says: \"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides.\"\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the setup. Alternatively, perhaps we should think of the sheet being folded along its length or width, resulting in a single folded piece, but the perimeter of that folded piece is 48 cm when folded one way and 66 cm when folded the other way.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it that way.\n\nSo when you fold along the length, the folded sheet is a rectangle of (L/2) by W, and the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = 48.\n\nSimilarly, when you fold along the width, the folded sheet is (W/2) by L, and the perimeter is 2*(W/2 + L) =66.\n\nSo same equations as before.\n\nWhich would yield L=28, W=10, area=280. But the options are way larger, perhaps in meters squared? Or I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, maybe I have the equations reversed. Because when folded along the length, perhaps the perimeter is 48, but when along the width, it's 66. Or maybe I swapped the perimeters.\n\nWait, let's check the problem statement again.\n\nProblem says: each part folded along one set of sides has a perimeter of 48 cm, and when folded along the other set, the perimeter is 66 cm.\n\nSo perhaps when you fold along one set (say, the length), each half has a perimeter of 48. When you fold along the other set (width), each half has a perimeter of 66.\n\nSo that's what I did, leading to L=28, W=10. So why is the area 280 not in the options?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to take the perimeters as the total of all four sides after folding. No, that's what I did.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's denote the original rectangle as L and W. When folded along the length, the sheet is divided into two parts of dimensions (L/2) and W each. Each part is a rectangle of length (L/2) and width W. So the perimeter of each is 2*( (L/2) + W )= L + 2W =48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, each part is (W/2) by L. Perimeter is 2*( (W/2) + L )= W + 2L =66.\n\nSo the equations are correct.\n\nSo, solving:\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W =48.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W =66.\n\nWait, no, equation 2 is W + 2L =66. So equation 2 is 2L + W =66.\n\nSo to solve:\n\nEquation 1: L =48 - 2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n2*(48-2W) + W =66 \u2192 96 -4W + W =66 \u2192 96 -3W=66 \u2192 -3W= -30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nThen L=48 -20=28.\n\nHmm, same result, but the area is 280.\n\nBut the options are A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two equal parts, meaning when folded, each part is a square? No, that's not stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have the perimeters when the sheet is folded to create a single folded piece. So instead of each half, the entire folded sheet has a perimeter. Let me think.\n\nFor example, when folded along the length, the sheet becomes a rectangle of (L/2) by W. The perimeter of this folded sheet is 2*( (L/2) + W )= L + 2W =48.\n\nWait, same as before. Same equations, same result.\n\nWait, then why isn't 280 in the options? Maybe I have the wrong approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the perimeters refer to the sum of all four sides, including the folded edges. Wait, but when you fold a sheet, the folded edges are internal, not part of the perimeter. So perhaps the perimeter is only the sum of the outer edges.\n\nWait, but in that case, when you fold a sheet along its length, the perimeter of the folded sheet would be the same as the original sheet? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, let me think of a concrete example. Suppose the sheet is 10 cm by 28 cm.\n\nFolding along the length (28 cm), each half becomes 14 cm by 10 cm. So each half's perimeter is 2*(14+10)=48 cm. Correct.\n\nFolding along the width (10 cm), each half is 5 cm by 28 cm. Perimeter is 2*(5+28)=2*33=66 cm. Correct.\n\nSo the area is 28*10=280 cm\u00b2. But the options are much larger, so perhaps the units are in meters? No, the problem says cm.\n\nWait, the options are 1584, which is 1584 cm\u00b2, which is 15.84 m\u00b2. That's a large sheet. But perhaps I'm wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the equations reversed. Let me try swapping the perimeters.\n\nSuppose when folded along the length, each half has a perimeter of 66 cm, and when along the width, 48 cm.\n\nSo equation 1: L + 2W =66.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W =48.\n\nLet me solve this.\n\nFrom equation 2: W =48 - 2L.\n\nSubstitute into equation1: L +2*(48-2L)=66 \u2192 L +96 -4L=66 \u2192-3L= -30 \u2192 L=10.\n\nThen W=48-2*10=28.\n\nSo the original sheet is 10 cm by 28 cm, same as before, area 280 cm\u00b2. Same problem.\n\nSo perhaps the equations are correct, but the options are wrong, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the perimeter of the folded sheet, not each half.\n\nWait, perhaps when you fold the sheet into two halves, the folded sheet's perimeter is 48 cm when folded along one side, and 66 when folded along the other.\n\nSo, for example, when folded along the length, the entire sheet becomes a rectangle of (L/2) by W. The perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W )= L + 2W. This is equal to 48 cm.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the sheet is (W/2) by L. Perimeter is 2*( (W/2) + L )= W + 2L. This is equal to 66 cm.\n\nSo same equations: L +2W=48, 2L+W=66.\n\nWhich leads to L=28, W=10. Area 280. But again, not in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are given for the folded sheet including the fold lines. But when you fold, the fold line becomes an internal line, but that's not part of the perimeter. So I think that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded along the other dimension, leading to different perimeters.\n\nWait, maybe I should set up the equations differently. Let me denote the length as x and width as y.\n\nWhen folded along the length, the sheet is divided into two parts each of dimension (x/2) by y. The perimeter of each part is 2*(x/2 + y) = x + 2y =48 cm.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is (y/2) by x. Perimeter is 2*(y/2 +x )= y + 2x =66 cm.\n\nSo equations:\n\nx +2y =48.\n\n2x + y =66.\n\nWait, no, the second equation is y +2x=66.\n\nSo solving:\n\nEquation 1: x =48-2y.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\ny + 2*(48-2y) =66 \u2192 y +96 -4y=66 \u2192 -3y= -30 \u2192 y=10.\n\nThen x=48-20=28. So same result.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the sheet folded into two, and the perimeter is of the combined two parts. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not considering that when folded, you might have to account for the folded edges as part of the perimeter. For example, when folding along one edge, perhaps the folded edge adds to the perimeter.\n\nWait, let's think: when you fold along the length, the sheet is (x/2) by y. The perimeter is 2*(x/2 + y) =x + 2y.\n\nBut when you fold along the edge, perhaps the folded edge is on the outside, so the perimeter would include that edge as well.\n\nWait, no. When you fold a sheet, the folded edge becomes an internal edge, not part of the perimeter. For example, when you have a sheet of paper and fold it in half along the length, the folded edge is on the inside, not contributing to the perimeter.\n\nSo the perimeter is only the outer edges.\n\nSo my initial approach is correct.\n\nHmm. Since the options are so much bigger than my solution, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, but the perimeters are for the entire folded sheet, not each part.\n\nWait, wait! Maybe I misread the question. Let me read again.\n\nThe question says: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48 cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66 cm when folded along the other set of sides.\n\nWait, perhaps the wording is that each part has a perimeter of 48 when folded along one set, and 66 when along the other.\n\nWait, but that's not changing the setup. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the folded sheet (the whole) has a perimeter of 48 cm when folded along one set, and 66 cm when along the other.\n\nSo in that case, when you fold along the length, the folded sheet is (x/2) by y, and the perimeter is 2*(x/2 + y) =x + 2y=48.\n\nAnd when you fold along the width, the folded sheet is (y/2) by x, and the perimeter is 2*(y/2 +x )= y +2x=66.\n\nSame equations, same solution.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, but the area I get is 280, which is not an option. The options are all much larger. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the perimeters given are for the folded sheets, but each sheet is folded into two parts, so perhaps the area is being considered for each part. No, the question asks for the area of the original sheet.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me re-examine.\n\nWhen folding along the length, each part is (x/2) by y. So the perimeter is 2*(x/2 + y) = x + 2y =48.\n\nWhen folding along the width, each part is (y/2) by x. Perimeter is 2*(y/2 +x )= y + 2x=66.\n\nSo equations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the original sheet when folded, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when the sheet is folded, the perimeter includes the folded edge. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's say the original sheet has length L and width W.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each part is (L/2) by W, perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W )= L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is (W/2) by L, perimeter is 2*( W/2 + L )= W + 2L=66.\n\nSo equations:\n\nL + 2W =48 \u2192 equation 1.\n\n2L + W =66 \u2192 equation 2.\n\nWait, no, equation 2 is W + 2L =66.\n\nSo, equation 1: L + 2W =48.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W =66.\n\nWait, no, it's W + 2L =66, which can be written as 2L + W =66.\n\nSo, same as before.\n\nSo solving:\n\nFrom equation 1: L =48 -2W.\n\nPlug into equation 2: 2*(48-2W) + W=66 \u219296 -4W +W =66 \u219296-3W=66 \u21923W=30 \u2192W=10.\n\nThen L=48-2*10=28.\n\nArea is 28*10=280. Not in options.\n\nHmm, maybe I should think in terms of the area being 280 cm\u00b2 and see if any option is 280. But the options are A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200.\n\nNo, 280 isn't present.\n\nWait, perhaps I should multiply by 2 because the sheet is folded into two parts, so each part's area is 140, but that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think that when folded, the perimeter includes both the outer sides and the fold line. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, when you fold a sheet, the folded edge becomes an internal edge. So for example, when folding along the length, the folded edge is internal and not part of the perimeter. So the perimeter is just the sum of the outer edges.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the sheet's dimensions as being halved in each direction. So when folded along the length, the length is halved, so the sheet becomes (L/2) by W. The perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W ) = L + 2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is (W/2) by L. Perimeter is 2*( (W/2) + L )= W + 2L=66.\n\nSame equations. So same result.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters given are of the original sheet when folded. But that doesn't make sense, because the original sheet's perimeter is 2(L + W). Folding wouldn't change that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using cm for everything. The options are in 1000s, so perhaps the area is in square meters? No, the problem states cm.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the perimeters are not of the folded sheet, but the sum of all four sides including the folded edges.\n\nWait, when you fold the sheet, the folded edge is on the inside. So for example, when you fold along the length, the sheet becomes (L/2) by W. The perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W ). But maybe, when you fold, the folded edge is part of the perimeter as a single edge. So maybe the perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W ) *2 ?\n\nNo, that would be incorrect because the folded part is internal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the folded perimeter as including the fold line, which would be a new edge. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps when you fold the sheet, one of the sides is now a double layer, but the perimeter would be the same as before. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think of the sheet as being folded into two parts, each with a certain perimeter, and the perimeters are additive for both parts.\n\nWait, if the sheet is folded into two parts each with perimeter 48, then the total perimeter of both would be 96. But that doesn't seem right because the folded edge is internal.\n\nWait, no, each part's perimeter is 48, but the two parts together make up the original sheet plus the folded edge. But that's not the case.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Since none of the options match my solution, I must have made a mistake. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me assign variables differently.\n\nLet me denote the length as x and the width as y.\n\nWhen the sheet is folded along the length, the folded part is (x/2) by y. The perimeter is 2*(x/2 + y) = x + 2y=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the folded part is (y/2) by x. Perimeter is 2*(y/2 +x )= y +2x=66.\n\nSo equations:\n\nx +2y=48.\n\n2x + y=66.\n\nWait, no, equation 2 is y + 2x=66.\n\nSo,\n\nEquation 1: x +2y=48 \u2192 x=48\u22122y.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: y +2*(48\u22122y)=66 \u2192 y +96\u22124y=66 \u2192 -3y=\u221230 \u2192 y=10.\n\nThen x=48\u221220=28.\n\nSame result as before.\n\nNow, perhaps the question is asking for the area of the sheet after folding, which would be (x/2)*y = (28/2)*10=140 cm\u00b2. But that's not among the options either.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the area of the original sheet, which is 28*10=280 cm\u00b2. So perhaps the options are wrong, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that when folded along a set of sides, the sheet is folded along the width, not the length. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps the length is the longer side, and the width is the shorter. So when folded along the length, the sheet is divided into two parts of L/2 and W. But maybe L and W are swapped.\n\nWait, in my previous solution, the sheet is 28 cm by 10 cm. If I swap them, it's 10 cm by 28 cm. So folding along the width (10 cm) would make each part 5 cm by 28 cm. The perimeter would be 2*(5+28)=66 cm, which matches. Similarly, folding along the length (28 cm) would make each part 14 cm by 10 cm. Perimeter 2*(14+10)=48 cm. Correct.\n\nSo area is indeed 280.\n\nBut since the options are much larger, perhaps I have made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are not for each half, but for the entire folded sheet.\n\nWait, when folded along the length, the sheet is (L/2) by W. The perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W )= L + 2W =48.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts in both directions, making four smaller rectangles, but that complicates the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when you fold the sheet into two parts along one set, the combined perimeters of both parts is 48 cm. But that doesn't make sense because that would be 2*(each part's perimeter) minus the overlapping edges.\n\nBut that's getting too complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the sheet is folded into two parts, each part's perimeter is 48 and 66. So when folded along one set, each half has a perimeter of 48. When folded along another set, each half has a perimeter of 66.\n\nBut that's the same as my initial approach.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should look for a different approach to set up the equations.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to write the equations as:\n\nWhen folded along length: 2*( (L/2) + W ) =48 \u2192 L +2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along width: 2*( (W/2) + L )=66 \u2192 W +2L=66.\n\nSo equations:\n\nL + 2W =48.\n\n2L + W =66.\n\nLet me solve these two equations.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2: 2L +4W=96.\n\nSubtract equation 2: (2L +4W) - (2L + W )=96-66 \u21923W=30\u2192W=10.\n\nThen from equation1: L=48\u221220=28.\n\nSo L=28, W=10. Area=28*10=280.\n\nBut no option matches. Hmm. So perhaps the problem expects the sheet to be folded into two parts, and each part's perimeter is the given perimeters, but the area is for each part, not the original.\n\nWait, no, problem says to find the area of the sheet, so that's the original.\n\nWait, unless the perimeters include both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps when the sheet is folded into two parts along one set, each part has a perimeter of 48, but the combined perimeters of both parts is 96. But that's not relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeter is for the entire sheet after folding, which would be the same as the sum of both parts minus the overlapping edges.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when you fold a sheet into two parts, the perimeter of the folded sheet is the same as the perimeter of each part, but I think not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the original sheet when folded in each direction.\n\nWait, that is, when the sheet is folded along the length, the perimeter of the folded sheet is 48 cm, and when folded along the width, it's 66 cm.\n\nSo same as before.\n\nSo I think I'm stuck here. Perhaps the correct answer is 280, but it's not in the options, so perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded along the length, and each part is a square. But that isn't stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the perimeter of the folded sheet is not the same as each part. Maybe the perimeter of the folded sheet includes the folded edge as part of the perimeter.\n\nWait, let me visualize: a sheet of L and W. When folded along the length, the sheet becomes a rectangle of L/2 by W. The perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W )=L +2W=48.\n\nIf, instead, the folded sheet's perimeter is L + 2W, which is 48, and likewise for the other direction.\n\nSame as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nI'm at a loss. Perhaps the correct answer is 280, but it's not an option. But since the options are so much larger, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait, wait. Maybe the perimeter when folded is the sum of all outer edges. Let me think for the first case.\n\nWhen you fold the sheet along the length, you have two layers of L/2 by W.\n\nSo the perimeter would be 2*(L/2) + 2*W = L + 2W.\n\nSame as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when you fold the sheet along one set, the folded part's perimeter is the original perimeter minus the length of the folded edge times two. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when you fold the sheet, the perimeter is the same as the original sheet.\n\nWait, the original sheet has perimeter 2(L + W). When you fold along the length, the folded sheet (each part) has perimeter 2*(L/2 + W )=L + 2W=48.\n\nSo L +2W=48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, the perimeter is 2*(W/2 + L )= W + 2L=66.\n\nSo same equations.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each fold brings together two layers, so the perimeter of the folded sheet is less. For example, when you fold along the length, you have two layers each of L/2 by W. The perimeter of the folded sheet (the whole) would include only the outer edges, so L/2 + W, but multiplied by two, but no, that's the same as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the perimeter of the folded sheet including the folded edge as a new edge. So when you fold along the length, the sheet becomes L/2 by W, but the folded edge is an additional edge. So the perimeter would be 2*(L/2 + W) + 2*(folded edge). But that's not correct because the folded edge is internal.\n\nI'm stuck. I think the answer is 280 cm\u00b2, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the perimeters as the perimeters of the folded sheet, not each part. So when the sheet is folded along the length, the folded sheet is L/2 by W, perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W )= L +2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, it's W/2 by L, perimeter 2*(W/2 + L )= W +2L=66.\n\nSame equations. So same solution.\n\nSo I think the answer is 280, but since it's not an option, perhaps the question has a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the perimeters include the folded edge as part of the perimeter. So when you fold along the length, you have a perimeter that includes the folded edge. So for example, the perimeter would be 2*( (L/2) + W ) + L (the folded edge)?\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. The folded edge is internal and not part of the perimeter.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the perimeters given are for the original sheet, but that's not possible because folding doesn't change the perimeter.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the perimeters are for both halves together. So when folded along the length, the total perimeter for both halves is 48 cm, and when folded along the width, it's 66 cm.\n\nBut that seems unlikely. Let me see.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each half is L/2 by W, perimeter each is 2*(L/2 + W )= L +2W. So two halves would have a combined perimeter of 2*(L +2W). But if the problem says the perimeter when folded is 48, that would be 2*(L +2W)=48 \u2192 L +2W=24.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, each half has perimeter 2*(W/2 + L )= W +2L. Two halves would have 2*(W +2L )=66 \u2192 W +2L=33.\n\nSo equations:\n\nEquation 1: L +2W=24.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W=33.\n\nSolving:\n\nFrom equation 1: L=24-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: 2*(24-2W) + W=33 \u219248-4W + W=33 \u2192-3W= -15 \u2192W=5.\n\nThen L=24-10=14.\n\nArea=14*5=70. Still not matching the options.\n\nHmm. So this approach also gives a small area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for each half when folded, which is the initial approach. So I'm back to the same problem.\n\nI'm really stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is 280, but it's not in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the sheet is not folded into two equal parts along the length or width, but along both directions. So perhaps the sheet is folded both along length and width, leading to smaller rectangles, but that complicates the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are not of the folded parts, but of the original sheet when it's folded along both sets of sides.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the sheet when folded along both length and width, creating four smaller rectangles. But that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in how the perimeters are calculated. For example, when you fold along the length, the sheet becomes a rectangle of L/2 by W, but perhaps the perimeter is calculated as 2*( (L/2) + W ) *2, because there are two layers. But that would give a perimeter of 2*( (L/2) + W ) *2= 2(L + 2W )=2L +4W = perimeter.\n\nBut the problem states the perimeter is 48 when folded along one set. So 2L +4W=48 \u2192 L +2W=24.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the other set, 2W +4L=66 \u2192 W +2L=33.\n\nSo now equations are:\n\nEquation1: L +2W=24.\n\nEquation2: 2L + W=33.\n\nSolving:\n\nEquation1: L=24-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation2: 2*(24-2W) +W=33 \u219248-4W +W=33 \u2192-3W= -15 \u2192 W=5.\n\nSo L=24-10=14.\n\nArea=14*5=70. Again, not in the options.\n\nHmm.\n\nI'm really stuck. Since none of the approaches are giving me a result that matches the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps when you fold the sheet along one set, the perimeter is the sum of the two outer edges, not the entire perimeter. Let me think.\n\nFor example, when you fold along the length, you have a sheet of L/2 by W. The perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W ). But perhaps the folded edge is on the outside, so the perimeter would be (L/2 + W ) + (L/2 + W )= same as before. So no change.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the combined folded parts. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the area of each folded part. So each part has an area of (L/2)*W.\n\nBut the problem asks for the original area, which would be 2*(L/2 * W )=L*W.\n\nSo same as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think I have to conclude that the correct answer is 280, but it's not among the options. However, since the options are all much larger, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are given for the entire folded sheet, not each part.\n\nWait, when you fold along the length, the sheet is (L/2) by W. The perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W )=48.\n\nSimilarly, when you fold along the width, the sheet is (W/2) by L. Perimeter is 2*( (W/2) + L )=66.\n\nSame equations as before.\n\nWait, maybe I should think that the perimeters are for the folded sheet, which is a single rectangle. So same as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the original sheet's perimeter is the sum of the two perimeters when folded in each direction.\n\nSo 48 +66=114=2(L + W).\n\nSo L + W=57.\n\nFrom the perimeters when folded:\n\nWhen folded along length: perimeter is 48= L + 2W.\n\nWhen folded along width: perimeter is66= 2L + W.\n\nSo equations:\n\nEquation1: L +2W=48.\n\nEquation2: 2L + W=66.\n\nEquation3: L + W=57.\n\nWait, equation3 comes from the sum of the two perimeters.\n\nBut let me check: 48 +66=114=2(L + W) \u2192 L + W=57.\n\nSo now, with three equations:\n\n1) L +2W=48.\n\n2) 2L + W=66.\n\n3) L + W=57.\n\nWait, let's check equation3: L + W=57.\n\nBut from equation1: L=48-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation3: 48-2W + W=57 \u219248 -W=57 \u2192 -W=9 \u2192 W= -9.\n\nImpossible. So this approach is wrong. So the sum of the perimeters isn't the perimeter of the original sheet.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possible approaches. Since none of the options match my solution, I must have made a mistake somewhere. But I can't figure out where. I'll proceed to write the step-by-step explanation as per the initial approach, even though it doesn't match the options.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by defining the dimensions of the rectangular sheet as length \\( L \\) and width \\( W \\). When the sheet is folded along one set of sides, it creates two smaller rectangles, and the perimeter of each smaller rectangle is given. The same process is repeated for folding along the other set of sides. Using this information, we can set up equations to solve for \\( L \\) and \\( W \\) and then calculate the area of the original sheet.\n\n### Step 1: Perimeter when folded along one set of sides\nWhen the sheet is folded along the length, each smaller rectangle has dimensions \\( \\frac{L}{2} \\times W \\). The perimeter of each smaller rectangle is given as \\( 48 \\, \\text{cm} \\). The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n\\]\nFor the folded sheet along the length:\n\\[\n2 \\times \\left( \\frac{L}{2} + W \\right) = 48\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\nL + 2W = 48 \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Perimeter when folded along the other set of sides\nWhen the sheet is folded along the width, each smaller rectangle has dimensions \\( \\frac{W}{2} \\times L \\). The perimeter of each smaller rectangle is given as \\( 66 \\, \\text{cm} \\). Using the perimeter formula:\n\\[\n2 \\times \\left( \\frac{W}{2} + L \\right) = 66\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\nW + 2L = 66 \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve the system of equations\nWe now have two equations:\n1. \\( L + 2W = 48 \\)\n2. \\( W + 2L = 66 \\)\n\nTo solve for \\( L \\) and \\( W \\), we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we use elimination:\n\n1. Multiply equation (1) by 2:\n\\[\n2L + 4W = 96 \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\n2. Subtract equation (2) from equation (3):\n\\[\n(2L + 4W) - (2L + W) = 96 - 66\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n3W = 30 \\implies W = 10\n\\]\n\n3. Substitute \\( W = 10 \\) back into equation (1):\n\\[\nL + 2(10) = 48 \\implies L = 48 - 20 = 28\n\\]\n\nThus, the dimensions of the original sheet are \\( L = 28 \\, \\text{cm} \\) and \\( W = 10 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the area of the original sheet\nThe area of a rectangle is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = L \\times W\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 28 \\times 10 = 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe area of the original rectangular sheet is \\( 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\). However, none of the provided options match this result. This discrepancy suggests either an issue with the problem setup or the options provided.\n\nANSWER: None of the options match the calculated result.",
