      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again and jot down the important points.\n\nAll 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So, there are no files that are completely clean. Every file has at least one of the two infections.\n\nThe number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. Hmm, I think I can represent this with variables. Let's say B is the number of files infected by both. Then, the files only with a worm would be 2.5 * B.\n\nAlso, 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, 50% of 250 is 125. So, 125 files don't have a virus. That means the other 125 files must have the virus. Wait, no, because some files could have both. So, the number of files with a virus could be more than 125, but the number not having a virus is exactly 125.\n\nWait, no. The 50% not infected by a virus implies that 50% are infected by a virus. So, 125 files are infected by a virus. But wait, because some are infected by both, the actual number is higher than that. Wait, wait. Let me think again.\n\nNo, no. If 50% are not infected by a virus, that means 50% are infected by a virus. So, 125 files are infected by a virus. But that includes those that have both a virus and a worm.\n\nSo, the virus-infected files are 125, which includes the files that have both. The worm-infected files are all the files except those that don't have a worm. Wait, but the files could have either a worm only, a virus only, or both.\n\nLet me try to visualize this with a Venn diagram. There's a circle for virus (V) and a circle for worm (W). The total area is 250, since all files are infected by at least one. The intersection is the files with both, which is B.\n\nSo, the files only with a worm are W_only = 2.5 * B.\n\nThe files only with a virus would be V_only = V - B. Because V includes those with both.\n\nWe know that V (virus-infected) is 125. So, V = V_only + B = 125.\n\nSimilarly, the total number of worm-infected files is W = W_only + B. But we don't know W directly.\n\nWait, the total files are V + W - B = 250. Because V and W overlap by B.\n\nWait, the sum of those with virus and those with worm minus those with both equals the total, which is 250.\n\nSo, V + W - B = 250.\n\nWe know V is 125.\n\nSo, 125 + W - B = 250 \u2192 W - B = 125 \u2192 W = B + 125.\n\nBut from the earlier info: W_only = 2.5 * B. And W = W_only + B \u2192 W = 2.5B + B = 3.5 B.\n\nSo, substituting into W = B + 125:\n\n3.5 B = B + 125 \u2192 3.5 B - B = 125 \u2192 2.5 B = 125 \u2192 B = 125 / 2.5 \u2192 B = 50.\n\nSo, the number of files with both is 50.\n\nThen, W = 3.5 * 50 = 175.\n\nSo, the number of files infected with a worm is 175, which includes those with both. The question is asking for the number of files not infected by a worm. Well, the files not infected by a worm would be the total files minus the worm-infected.\n\nWait, no. Because all files are infected by either virus or worm or both. So, the files not infected by a worm are those that are only infected by a virus.\n\nWait, let's think again. The files not infected by a worm would be the files that have neither. But wait, the problem says all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So, there are no files that have neither. So, the files not infected by a worm must be those that have a virus only.\n\nSo, the number of files not infected by a worm is V_only.\n\nEarlier, V_only is V - B \u2192 125 - 50 = 75.\n\nWait, so V_only is 75. So, the number of files not infected by a worm is 75.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 75.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nV=125, B=50.\n\nW_only = 2.5 * 50 = 125. So, worm-only is 125, both is 50. So, worm-infected is 125+50=175.\n\nVirus-only is 125-50=75. \n\nTotal files: 75 (virus-only) + 125 (worm-only) +50 (both)= 250. Wait, 75+125 is 200, plus 50 is 250. That checks out.\n\nSo the number of files not infected by a worm is 75, which is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's define the variables and use the given information:\n\n1. **Total files**: 250. All files are infected by either a virus, a worm, or both.\n2. **Files infected only by a worm**: Let this be \\( W_{\\text{only}} \\). According to the problem, \\( W_{\\text{only}} = 2.5 \\times B \\), where \\( B \\) is the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.\n3. **Files infected by a virus**: 50% of 250, which is \\( 125 \\). This includes files infected only by a virus (\\( V_{\\text{only}} \\)) and files infected by both (\\( B \\)).\n4. **Files infected by a worm**: This includes files infected only by a worm (\\( W_{\\text{only}} \\)) and files infected by both (\\( B \\)). Thus, \\( W = W_{\\text{only}} + B \\).\n\nFrom the total files equation:\n\\[\nV + W - B = 250\n\\]\nSubstitute \\( V = 125 \\):\n\\[\n125 + W - B = 250 \\implies W - B = 125 \\implies W = B + 125\n\\]\n\nFrom the definition of \\( W \\):\n\\[\nW = W_{\\text{only}} + B\n\\]\nSubstitute \\( W_{\\text{only}} = 2.5B \\):\n\\[\nW = 2.5B + B = 3.5B\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( W = 3.5B \\) into \\( W = B + 125 \\):\n\\[\n3.5B = B + 125 \\implies 2.5B = 125 \\implies B = \\frac{125}{2.5} = 50\n\\]\n\nThus:\n- \\( B = 50 \\) (files infected by both).\n- \\( W_{\\text{only}} = 2.5 \\times 50 = 125 \\) (files infected only by a worm).\n- \\( V_{\\text{only}} = V - B = 125 - 50 = 75 \\) (files infected only by a virus).\n\nThe number of files **not infected by a worm** is the same as the number of files infected only by a virus, which is \\( V_{\\text{only}} = 75 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**: C) 75",
