      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rectangular parking space. Let's see, the problem says that three of its sides are painted, and the fourth side is unpainted. The length of the unpainted side is 9 feet. The sum of the painted sides is 37 feet. I need to find the area of the parking space in square feet.\n\nHmm, rectangles have two pairs of equal sides. So, if it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. Let me think about the possible configurations. Since three sides are painted, the unpainted side could either be the length or the width. Wait, no, actually, it depends on how they painted it. Like, maybe they painted two lengths and one width, leaving the other width unpainted. Or maybe they painted two widths and one length, leaving the other length unpainted.\n\nLet me visualize this. Imagine the rectangle has a length (let's say L) and a width (W). So, the perimeter would be 2L + 2W. If three sides are painted, then the sum of those three sides is 37 feet. But the fourth side is not painted and is 9 feet.\n\nWait, but in a rectangle, there are two lengths and two widths. So, the three painted sides could be either L, L, and W. Or, they could be W, W, and L. Let me write this down.\n\nCase 1: The unpainted side is a length (L) of 9 feet. So, the painted sides would be the other length (L) and both widths (W each). So the painted sides sum up to L + 2W = 37. But in this case, unpainted L is 9. So L =9. Then 9 + 2W =37. Let me solve that. 2W=37-9=28. So W=14. Then area would be L * W =9*14=126. So that's one possibility.\n\nCase 2: The unpainted side is a width (W) of 9 feet. Then the painted sides would be the other width (W) and both lengths (L each). So, the painted sides sum to 2L + W =37. Since W=9, then 2L +9=37. So 2L=28, L=14. Then area is L*W=14*9=126 again. So in both cases, the area is 126.\n\nWait a second, that's interesting. So regardless of whether the unpainted side is length or width, the area comes out the same. So the area is 126 square feet.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 126. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. What if the configuration is different? Like, maybe the three sides are two widths and one length? Or two lengths and one width? No, wait, that's what I already considered in the cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should write equations formally.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet the length be L and width be W.\n\nIf the unpainted side is L, then the painted sides are L + 2W.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if the unpainted side is one length, then the three painted sides would be two widths and one length. Because the rectangle has two lengths and two widths. So if one length is unpainted, the other length and both widths are painted. So the sum of painted sides is L + 2W =37. And the unpainted L is 9, so L=9.\n\nSo equation: 9 + 2W =37 \u2192 2W=28 \u2192 W=14. Area is 9*14=126.\n\nAlternatively, if the unpainted side is a width, then the painted sides are two lengths and one width. So sum is 2L + W=37. Unpainted W=9, so 2L +9=37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Area is 14*9=126.\n\nSo either way, area is 126. So the correct answer is C)126.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the dimensions of the rectangular parking space. Let the length and width of the rectangle be \\( L \\) and \\( W \\), respectively. Three sides are painted, and the fourth side is unpainted with a length of 9 feet. The sum of the painted sides is 37 feet.\n\n### Case 1: Unpainted side is a length (\\( L = 9 \\))\nIf the unpainted side is a length, the painted sides consist of the other length and both widths. Thus, the sum of the painted sides is:\n\\[\nL + 2W = 37\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( L = 9 \\):\n\\[\n9 + 2W = 37 \\implies 2W = 28 \\implies W = 14\n\\]\nThe area of the rectangle is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = L \\times W = 9 \\times 14 = 126\n\\]\n\n### Case 2: Unpainted side is a width (\\( W = 9 \\))\nIf the unpainted side is a width, the painted sides consist of both lengths and the other width. Thus, the sum of the painted sides is:\n\\[\n2L + W = 37\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( W = 9 \\):\n\\[\n2L + 9 = 37 \\implies 2L = 28 \\implies L = 14\n\\]\nThe area of the rectangle is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = L \\times W = 14 \\times 9 = 126\n\\]\n\nIn both cases, the area of the parking space is \\( 126 \\, \\text{square feet} \\).\n\n### Final Answer:\nC) 126",
