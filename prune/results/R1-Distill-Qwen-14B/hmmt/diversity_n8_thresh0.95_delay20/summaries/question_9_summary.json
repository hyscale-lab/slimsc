The coefficient is expressed as a reduced fraction \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\), and we need to find an integer \\( r \\) between 0 and 2026 such that \\( a - rb \\) is divisible by 2027.\n\nUsing properties of polynomials and modular arithmetic, particularly leveraging the fact that 2027 is prime, we simplify the problem. The key steps involve recognizing that the coefficient of \\( x^{2025} \\) modulo 2027 can be found by summing terms involving perfect squares and their modular inverses. After careful calculations and simplifications, we find that the coefficient modulo 2027 is 45. Thus, the integer \\( r \\) that satisfies the condition is 45.\n\n\\boxed{45}"
