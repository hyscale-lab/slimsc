Each snake moves left or right with equal probability, and when two snakes meet, they merge. The goal is to find the expected time until only one snake remains.\n\n1. **Two-Particle Meeting Time**: For two snakes on a circle of circumference \\( L \\) starting at distance \\( d \\), the expected meeting time is \\( T(d) = d \\times (L - d) \\). Here, \\( L = 45 \\) and \\( d = 3 \\), so \\( T(3) = 3 \\times 42 = 126 \\) seconds.\n\n2. **Merging Process**: Each merger reduces the number of snakes by one. Starting with 15 snakes, 14 mergers are needed. Each merger's expected time is 126 seconds due to symmetry.\n\n3. **Total Expected Time**: Summing the expected times for each merger gives \\( 14 \\times 126 = 1764 \\) seconds.\n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{1764}\\)"
