      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a rectangle ABCD with BC = 24. There's a point X inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. Also, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute and have circumradii of 13 and 15, respectively. I need to find the length of AB.\n\nHmm, let's start by drawing a diagram to visualize the problem. So, ABCD is a rectangle, which means all angles are right angles, and opposite sides are equal. Let me denote AB as the length we need to find, let's call it 'a'. Then, BC is given as 24, so AD is also 24 since it's a rectangle.\n\nPoint X is inside the rectangle, and angle AXB is 90 degrees. So, triangle AXB is a right-angled triangle. That might come in handy later. Also, triangles AXD and BXC are acute, which means all their angles are less than 90 degrees. Their circumradii are given as 13 and 15, respectively.\n\nI remember that for a triangle, the circumradius R can be calculated using the formula R = (a * b * c) / (4 * area), where a, b, c are the sides. Or, for a right-angled triangle, the circumradius is half the hypotenuse. But in this case, AXD and BXC are not necessarily right-angled; they are just acute.\n\nWait, but since angle AXB is 90 degrees, maybe I can use some properties related to that. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of the rectangle to make it easier. Let's place point A at (0, 0), so point B would be at (a, 0), point C at (a, 24), and point D at (0, 24). Then, point X is somewhere inside this rectangle. Let me assign coordinates to X as (x, y), where 0 < x < a and 0 < y < 24.\n\nGiven that angle AXB is 90 degrees, the vectors AX and BX should be perpendicular. The vector AX is (x, y), and the vector BX is (x - a, y). Their dot product should be zero.\n\nCalculating the dot product: x*(x - a) + y*y = 0. So, x^2 - a x + y^2 = 0. That's one equation.\n\nNow, let's think about triangles AXD and BXC. Both have circumradii given, so maybe I can write equations for their circumradii in terms of coordinates.\n\nFirst, triangle AXD. The points are A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24). The circumradius R1 is 13. Similarly, triangle BXC has points B(a,0), X(x,y), C(a,24), and circumradius R2 is 15.\n\nI need to find the circumradius for each triangle. The formula for the circumradius R of a triangle with sides of length a, b, c is R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where \u0394 is the area of the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, for any triangle with coordinates, I can use the formula involving determinants, but that might get complicated. Maybe I can find the sides of each triangle and then use the formula.\n\nLet me compute the sides of triangle AXD first.\n\nAX: distance from A to X = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)\nXD: distance from X to D = sqrt((0 - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2) = sqrt(x^2 + (24 - y)^2)\nAD: distance from A to D = 24\n\nWait, but in triangle AXD, the sides are AX, XD, and AD. So, sides are sqrt(x^2 + y^2), sqrt(x^2 + (24 - y)^2), and 24.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC:\n\nBX: distance from B to X = sqrt((a - x)^2 + y^2)\nXC: distance from X to C = sqrt((a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2)\nBC: distance from B to C = 24\n\nBut wait, triangle BXC's sides are BX, XC, and BC. So, that's sqrt((a - x)^2 + y^2), sqrt((a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2), and 24.\n\nHmm, so both triangles AXD and BXC have one side of length 24 and another pair of sides dependent on X's coordinates.\n\nI also know that the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle. For any triangle, R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where \u0394 is the area.\n\nAlternatively, for a triangle with sides a, b, c, the circumradius can also be found using the formula:\n\nR = a / (2*sin A) = b / (2*sin B) = c / (2*sin C)\n\nBut since the triangles are acute, all the angles are less than 90 degrees, so sine of each angle is positive.\n\nAlternatively, there's another formula that might be useful here: for any triangle with coordinates, the circumradius can be found using the formula:\n\nR = |(a b c)| / (4 * area)\n\nBut I think this might lead to very complicated equations. Maybe I should find another approach.\n\nWait, I remember that in a right-angled triangle, the circumradius is half the hypotenuse. But AXB is a right-angled triangle, so the circumradius of triangle AXB is (AB)/2 = a/2. But I don't know if that's useful here.\n\nWait, maybe I can use coordinate geometry to find the circumradius of triangles AXD and BXC.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the property that the circumradius R of a triangle with vertices at (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) can be found using the formula:\n\nR = \\frac{\\sqrt{( |x_2 - x_1|^2 + |y_2 - y_1|^2 ) ( |x_3 - x_1|^2 + |y_3 - y_1|^2 ) ( |x_3 - x_2|^2 + |y_3 - y_2|^2 )}}{4 * area}\n\nBut that seems complicated. Maybe it's better to use another approach.\n\nWait, since we have triangles AXD and BXC, maybe we can find their circumradius in terms of distances from X.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that the circumradius of a triangle is given by R = \\frac{abc}{4\u0394}, where \u0394 is the area. So, if I can compute the sides and the area of the triangles AXD and BXC, I can set up equations for R1 and R2.\n\nLet me try for triangle AXD first.\n\nTriangle AXD:\n\nPoints A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24).\n\nSides:\n\nAX: sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = let's denote this as s1.\n\nXD: sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)\u00b2) = s2.\n\nAD: 24 = s3.\n\nSo, sides are s1, s2, s3.\n\nArea of triangle AXD can be found using the coordinates. Since points are (0,0), (x,y), (0,24), it's a triangle with base along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0,24). The area can be calculated as (base * height)/2, where base is 24 and height is x (since X is at (x,y), so the horizontal distance from the y-axis is x). So area \u03941 = (24 * x)/2 = 12x.\n\nSo, area is 12x.\n\nCircumradius R1 = (s1 * s2 * s3) / (4 * \u03941) = (s1 * s2 * 24) / (4 * 12x) = (s1 * s2 * 24) / (48x) = (s1 * s2) / (2x).\n\nBut R1 is given as 13.\n\nSo, (s1 * s2) / (2x) = 13.\n\nSimilarly, s1 is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), s2 is sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2).\n\nSo, (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2)) / (2x) = 13.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) = 26x.\n\nHmm, that's a complicated equation, but maybe we can square both sides to eliminate the square roots.\n\nSo, (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) = (26x)^2 = 676x\u00b2.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) = x^4 + x\u00b2*(24 - y)^2 + x\u00b2*y\u00b2 + y\u00b2*(24 - y)^2.\n\nWait, perhaps expanding it step by step:\n\nFirst, let me compute (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2):\n\n= x\u00b2 * x\u00b2 + x\u00b2 * (24 - y)^2 + y\u00b2 * x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 * (24 - y)^2\n\n= x^4 + x\u00b2*(24 - y)^2 + x\u00b2 y\u00b2 + y\u00b2*(24 - y)^2\n\nHmm, maybe factor differently. Alternatively, notice that (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) = [x\u00b2 + y(24 - y)]\u00b2 - [y(24 - y)]\u00b2 + x^4 ?\n\nWait, perhaps that's complicating. Alternatively, let's compute each term.\n\nFirst, compute (24 - y)^2 = 576 - 48y + y\u00b2.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + 576 - 48y + y\u00b2) = x^4 + x\u00b2*(576 - 48y + y\u00b2) + y\u00b2*(576 - 48y + y\u00b2) + x\u00b2 y\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, actually, that's not correct. Let's actually compute it step by step.\n\nWait, no, it's (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + 576 - 48y + y\u00b2) = x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 + 576 - 48y + y\u00b2) + y\u00b2*(x\u00b2 + 576 - 48y + y\u00b2)\n\n= x^4 + 576x\u00b2 - 48x\u00b2 y + x\u00b2 y\u00b2 + x\u00b2 y\u00b2 + 576 y\u00b2 - 48 y^3 + y^4\n\nSimplify:\n\nx^4 + 576x\u00b2 - 48x\u00b2 y + 2x\u00b2 y\u00b2 + 576 y\u00b2 - 48 y^3 + y^4.\n\nThis seems messy, but perhaps we can find a smarter approach.\n\nWait, maybe instead of expanding, I can think of the product (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) as |AX|\u00b2 |XD|\u00b2. Maybe I can use some other geometric property.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that in triangle AXD, the circumradius is 13, so using the formula R = a / (2 sin A), where A is the angle opposite side a.\n\nBut I don't know the angles in triangle AXD. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since I know the area is 12x, and R = (a b c) / (4 * area), maybe I can write for triangle AXD:\n\n13 = (AX * XD * AD) / (4 * 12x)\n\nSo, 13 = (AX * XD * 24) / (48x) => 13 = (AX * XD) / (2x)\n\nWhich is the same as before. So, I get back to (AX * XD) = 26x.\n\nSame equation. So, perhaps I need another equation.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC, let's compute.\n\nTriangle BXC:\n\nPoints B(a,0), X(x,y), C(a,24).\n\nSides:\n\nBX: sqrt((a - x)^2 + y^2) = t1.\n\nXC: sqrt((a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2) = t2.\n\nBC: 24 = t3.\n\nArea of triangle BXC: since points are (a,0), (x,y), (a,24). It's a triangle with base along the line x = a from (a,0) to (a,24). The base length is 24, and the horizontal distance from X to this base is (a - x). So, area \u03942 = (24 * (a - x))/2 = 12(a - x).\n\nCircumradius R2 = (t1 * t2 * t3) / (4 * \u03942) = (t1 * t2 * 24) / (4 * 12(a - x)) = (t1 * t2 * 24) / (48(a - x)) = (t1 * t2) / (2(a - x)).\n\nGiven R2 = 15, so:\n\n(t1 * t2) / (2(a - x)) = 15 => t1 * t2 = 30(a - x).\n\nBut t1 is sqrt((a - x)^2 + y^2) and t2 is sqrt((a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2).\n\nSo, sqrt((a - x)^2 + y^2) * sqrt((a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2) = 30(a - x).\n\nAgain, squaring both sides:\n\n[(a - x)^2 + y^2][(a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2] = [30(a - x)]^2 = 900(a - x)^2.\n\nExpanding the left side similarly:\n\n[(a - x)^2 + y^2][(a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2] = [(a - x)^2]^2 + (a - x)^2*(24 - y)^2 + y^2*(a - x)^2 + y^2*(24 - y)^2.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(a - x)^4 + (a - x)^2*(24 - y)^2 + (a - x)^2 y^2 + y^2*(24 - y)^2.\n\nAgain, that's a bit messy, but perhaps I can make substitutions.\n\nLet me denote u = (a - x) and v = y. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)(u\u00b2 + (24 - v)^2) = 900 u\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, for the other triangle AXD, I had:\n\n(x\u00b2 + v\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - v)^2) = 676 x\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe I can relate these two equations.\n\nWait, note that (x\u00b2 + v\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - v)^2) = 676 x\u00b2.\n\nAnd (u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)(u\u00b2 + (24 - v)^2) = 900 u\u00b2.\n\nBut u = a - x, so u = a - x.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find a relationship between these two products.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can subtract the two equations.\n\nWait, but I don't know a yet, so maybe that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps if I denote x and u in terms of a.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the original condition: angle AXB is 90 degrees.\n\nEarlier, I had the equation from the dot product:\n\nx\u00b2 - a x + y\u00b2 = 0.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x.\n\nThat's a key equation.\n\nSo, from that, we can write x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x.\n\nSimilarly, in triangle AXD, we have:\n\n(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) = 676 x\u00b2.\n\nBut x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x, so substitute that into the equation:\n\n(a x)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) = 676 x\u00b2.\n\nDivide both sides by x (assuming x \u2260 0, which it isn't since X is inside the rectangle):\n\na (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) = 676 x.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC, we have:\n\n(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)(u\u00b2 + (24 - v)^2) = 900 u\u00b2.\n\nBut u = a - x, and v = y.\n\nSo, ( (a - x)^2 + y^2 ) ( (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 900 (a - x)^2.\n\nAgain, let me use the fact that u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = (a - x)^2 + y\u00b2.\n\nBut perhaps I can relate this to the previous equation.\n\nWait, from triangle AXD:\n\na (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 676 x.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 = (676 x)/a.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC:\n\n(a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 = (900 (a - x))/a.\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly. Let me think.\n\nWait, for triangle BXC:\n\nWe have ( (a - x)^2 + y^2 ) ( (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 900 (a - x)^2.\n\nLet me denote (a - x)^2 = u\u00b2 and y = v.\n\nThen, (u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)(u\u00b2 + (24 - v)^2) = 900 u\u00b2.\n\nBut from triangle AXD, we have:\n\n(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) = 676 x\u00b2.\n\nWhich is (x\u00b2 + v\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - v)^2) = 676 x\u00b2.\n\nSo, these are similar forms.\n\nI wonder if I can find a relationship between x and u.\n\nSince u = a - x, perhaps I can express u in terms of x.\n\nBut I also know from the first equation that x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 = (a - x)^2 = a\u00b2 - 2 a x + x\u00b2.\n\nBut x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x, so x\u00b2 = a x - y\u00b2.\n\nSubstitute into u\u00b2:\n\nu\u00b2 = a\u00b2 - 2 a x + (a x - y\u00b2) = a\u00b2 - a x - y\u00b2.\n\nHmm, that might not be helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express (a - x)^2 in terms of x and y.\n\nFrom x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x, we can write a = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)/x.\n\nSo, a = x + (y\u00b2)/x.\n\nSo, u = a - x = (y\u00b2)/x.\n\nTherefore, u = y\u00b2 / x.\n\nThat's an important relation: u = y\u00b2 / x.\n\nSo, (a - x) = y\u00b2 / x.\n\nTherefore, (a - x)^2 = y^4 / x\u00b2.\n\nSo, (a - x)^2 = y^4 / x\u00b2.\n\nLet me use this in the equation from triangle BXC.\n\nWe have:\n\n[(a - x)^2 + y^2][(a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2] = 900(a - x)^2.\n\nSubstitute (a - x)^2 = y^4 / x\u00b2:\n\n[ (y^4 / x\u00b2) + y^2 ] [ (y^4 / x\u00b2) + (24 - y)^2 ] = 900 (y^4 / x\u00b2).\n\nLet me factor y^2 from the first bracket:\n\ny^2 [ y\u00b2 / x\u00b2 + 1 ] [ (y^4 / x\u00b2) + (24 - y)^2 ] = 900 (y^4 / x\u00b2).\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but maybe I can write each term in terms of y and x.\n\nWait, let's compute each bracket step by step.\n\nFirst bracket: (y^4 / x\u00b2) + y^2 = y\u00b2(y\u00b2 / x\u00b2 + 1) = y\u00b2 ( (y\u00b2 + x\u00b2)/x\u00b2 ).\n\nBut from x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x, which is (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = a x.\n\nSo, (y\u00b2 + x\u00b2)/x\u00b2 = a x / x\u00b2 = a / x.\n\nSo, first bracket becomes y\u00b2 * (a / x) = (a y\u00b2)/x.\n\nSecond bracket: (y^4 / x\u00b2) + (24 - y)^2.\n\n= (y^4 + (24 - y)^2 x\u00b2 ) / x\u00b2.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write the entire left side as:\n\n[ (a y\u00b2)/x ] * [ (y^4 / x\u00b2) + (24 - y)^2 ].\n\nSo, entire equation:\n\n[ (a y\u00b2)/x ] * [ (y^4 / x\u00b2) + (24 - y)^2 ] = 900 (y^4 / x\u00b2).\n\nMultiply both sides by x\u00b2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n[ a y\u00b2 / x ] * [ y^4 + (24 - y)^2 x\u00b2 ] = 900 y^4.\n\nLet me compute the second bracket inside:\n\ny^4 + (24 - y)^2 x\u00b2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as y^4 + x\u00b2(24 - y)^2.\n\nWait, but from triangle AXD, I have:\n\nFrom the earlier equation:\n\na (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 676 x.\n\nWe can write a = 676 x / (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ).\n\nSo, a = 676 x / (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ).\n\nLet me substitute a into the equation.\n\nSo, [ (676 x / (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )) * y\u00b2 / x ] * [ y^4 + (24 - y)^2 x\u00b2 ] = 900 y^4.\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\nThe first term is (676 x / (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )) * (y\u00b2 / x) = 676 y\u00b2 / (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n[ 676 y\u00b2 / (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ] * [ y^4 + (24 - y)^2 x\u00b2 ] = 900 y^4.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\n676 y\u00b2 * [ y^4 + (24 - y)^2 x\u00b2 ] / (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 900 y^4.\n\nLet me factor the denominator:\n\nDenominator: x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2.\n\nNumerator inside the bracket: y^4 + x\u00b2 (24 - y)^2 = y^4 + x\u00b2 (24 - y)^2.\n\nHmm, let's factor this as y^4 + x\u00b2 (24 - y)^2 = (y\u00b2)^2 + (x (24 - y))\u00b2.\n\nWait, that looks like a sum of squares, but I don't know if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor the entire expression.\n\nWait, let's write the numerator as y^4 + x\u00b2 (24 - y)^2. Let me write it as y^4 + x\u00b2 (24 - y)^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor out (24 - y)^2:\n\nWait, that would be (24 - y)^2 (x\u00b2 + (y^4)/(24 - y)^2 ). Hmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, but from the equation from triangle AXD, we have:\n\na (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 676 x.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 = (676 x)/a.\n\nBut a = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)/x from earlier.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 = (676 x) / ( (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)/x ) = (676 x^2) / (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 = (676 x^2) / (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nBut from triangle AXD, we have:\n\n(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 676 x\u00b2.\n\nSo, indeed, (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 676 x\u00b2.\n\nWhich gives x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 = 676 x\u00b2 / (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nSo, substituting back, the numerator:\n\ny^4 + x\u00b2 (24 - y)^2 = y^4 + x\u00b2 * [ (676 x\u00b2)/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - x\u00b2 ].\n\nWait, because x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 = (676 x\u00b2)/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), so (24 - y)^2 = (676 x\u00b2)/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - x\u00b2.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\ny^4 + x\u00b2 [ (676 x\u00b2)/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - x\u00b2 ] = y^4 + (676 x^4)/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - x^4.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= y^4 - x^4 + (676 x^4)/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nHmm, perhaps factor y^4 - x^4 as (y\u00b2 - x^2)(y\u00b2 + x^2).\n\nSo, = (y\u00b2 - x\u00b2)(y\u00b2 + x\u00b2) + (676 x^4)/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\n= (y\u00b2 - x\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (676 x^4)/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\n= (y\u00b2 - x\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + [676 x^4]/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n= [ (y\u00b2 - x\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)^2 + 676 x^4 ] / (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nWait, no, perhaps a better approach.\n\nLet me combine the terms:\n\n= (y\u00b2 - x\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (676 x^4)/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nFactor out 1/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2):\n\n= [ (y\u00b2 - x\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)^2 + 676 x^4 ] / (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nHmm, maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can substitute t = y^2 / x^2, so t is a positive real number since x and y are positive.\n\nLet me set t = y\u00b2 / x\u00b2, so y\u00b2 = t x\u00b2.\n\nThen, from the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x, we have:\n\nx\u00b2 + t x\u00b2 = a x => x (1 + t) = a.\n\nSo, a = x (1 + t).\n\nSimilarly, from the equation from triangle AXD:\n\n(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 676 x\u00b2.\n\nSubstituting y\u00b2 = t x\u00b2:\n\n(x\u00b2 + t x\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 676 x\u00b2.\n\nFactor x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 (1 + t) * [x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ] = 676 x\u00b2.\n\nDivide both sides by x\u00b2:\n\n(1 + t) [x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ] = 676.\n\nSo, [x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ] = 676 / (1 + t).\n\nBut y = sqrt(t) x, so 24 - y = 24 - sqrt(t) x.\n\nSo, (24 - y)^2 = 576 - 48 sqrt(t) x + t x\u00b2.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 = x\u00b2 + 576 - 48 sqrt(t) x + t x\u00b2 = (1 + t) x\u00b2 + 576 - 48 sqrt(t) x.\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n(1 + t) [ (1 + t) x\u00b2 + 576 - 48 sqrt(t) x ] = 676.\n\nBut from earlier, a = x (1 + t) => x = a / (1 + t).\n\nSo, x = a / (1 + t).\n\nSubstituting x into the equation:\n\n(1 + t) [ (1 + t) (a\u00b2 / (1 + t)^2 ) + 576 - 48 sqrt(t) (a / (1 + t)) ] = 676.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term inside the brackets: (1 + t) * (a\u00b2 / (1 + t)^2 ) = a\u00b2 / (1 + t).\n\nSecond term: 576.\n\nThird term: -48 sqrt(t) * (a / (1 + t)) = -48 a sqrt(t) / (1 + t).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + t) [ a\u00b2 / (1 + t) + 576 - 48 a sqrt(t) / (1 + t) ] = 676.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1 + t) * [ a\u00b2 / (1 + t) + 576 - 48 a sqrt(t) / (1 + t) ] = 676.\n\nFactor out 1/(1 + t):\n\n(1 + t) * [ (a\u00b2 - 48 a sqrt(t) + 576 (1 + t)) / (1 + t) ) ] = 676.\n\nSimplify:\n\n[ a\u00b2 - 48 a sqrt(t) + 576 (1 + t) ] = 676.\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 - 48 a sqrt(t) + 576 + 576 t = 676.\n\nSubtract 676 from both sides:\n\na\u00b2 - 48 a sqrt(t) + 576 + 576 t - 676 = 0.\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n576 - 676 = -100.\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 - 48 a sqrt(t) + 576 t - 100 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's one equation.\n\nNow, let's see if we can get another equation from triangle BXC.\n\nFrom triangle BXC, we had:\n\n[(a - x)^2 + y^2][(a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2] = 900 (a - x)^2.\n\nAgain, using substitution t = y\u00b2 / x\u00b2, so y = sqrt(t) x.\n\nSimilarly, a - x = u, and from earlier, u = y\u00b2 / x = t x.\n\nSo, a - x = t x => a = x (1 + t).\n\nWhich is consistent with our earlier substitution.\n\nSo, let me write (a - x) = t x.\n\nSo, (a - x)^2 = t\u00b2 x\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, (24 - y)^2 = (24 - sqrt(t) x)^2 = 576 - 48 sqrt(t) x + t x\u00b2.\n\nSo, let's compute the left side of the equation for triangle BXC:\n\n[(a - x)^2 + y^2][(a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2] = [ t\u00b2 x\u00b2 + t x\u00b2 ][ t\u00b2 x\u00b2 + (576 - 48 sqrt(t) x + t x\u00b2) ].\n\nSimplify each bracket:\n\nFirst bracket: t\u00b2 x\u00b2 + t x\u00b2 = x\u00b2 t (t + 1).\n\nSecond bracket: t\u00b2 x\u00b2 + 576 - 48 sqrt(t) x + t x\u00b2 = 576 - 48 sqrt(t) x + x\u00b2 t (t + 1).\n\nSo, the product is:\n\nx\u00b2 t (t + 1) * [576 - 48 sqrt(t) x + x\u00b2 t (t + 1)].\n\nAnd this equals 900 (a - x)^2 = 900 t\u00b2 x\u00b2.\n\nSo, equation:\n\nx\u00b2 t (t + 1) * [576 - 48 sqrt(t) x + x\u00b2 t (t + 1)] = 900 t\u00b2 x\u00b2.\n\nDivide both sides by x\u00b2 t (t + 1):\n\n[576 - 48 sqrt(t) x + x\u00b2 t (t + 1)] = (900 t\u00b2 x\u00b2 ) / [x\u00b2 t (t + 1)].\n\nSimplify RHS: 900 t\u00b2 x\u00b2 / (x\u00b2 t (t + 1)) ) = 900 t / (t + 1).\n\nSo,\n\n576 - 48 sqrt(t) x + x\u00b2 t (t + 1) = 900 t / (t + 1).\n\nAgain, since a = x (1 + t), so x = a / (1 + t).\n\nSubstitute x:\n\n576 - 48 sqrt(t) (a / (1 + t)) + (a\u00b2 / (1 + t)^2) * t (t + 1) = 900 t / (t + 1).\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: 576.\n\nSecond term: -48 a sqrt(t) / (1 + t).\n\nThird term: (a\u00b2 / (1 + t)^2 ) * t (t + 1) = a\u00b2 t / (1 + t).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n576 - (48 a sqrt(t))/(1 + t) + (a\u00b2 t)/(1 + t) = (900 t)/(1 + t).\n\nMultiply all terms by (1 + t) to eliminate denominators:\n\n576 (1 + t) - 48 a sqrt(t) + a\u00b2 t = 900 t.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n576 (1 + t) - 48 a sqrt(t) + a\u00b2 t - 900 t = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n576 + 576 t - 48 a sqrt(t) + a\u00b2 t - 900 t = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n576 + (576 t - 900 t) - 48 a sqrt(t) + a\u00b2 t = 0.\n\nWhich is:\n\n576 - 324 t - 48 a sqrt(t) + a\u00b2 t = 0.\n\nHmm, so now we have two equations:\n\n1.

From triangle BXC:\n576 - 324 t - 48 a sqrt(t) + a\u00b2 t = 0.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEquation (1): a\u00b2 - 48 a sqrt(t) + 576 t - 100 = 0.\n\nEquation (2): a\u00b2 t - 48 a sqrt(t) - 324 t + 576 = 0.\n\nHmm, maybe we can subtract equation (1) multiplied by t from equation (2) to eliminate some terms.\n\nLet me compute equation (2) - t * equation (1):\n\nEquation (2): a\u00b2 t - 48 a sqrt(t) - 324 t + 576.\n\nt * equation (1): t a\u00b2 - 48 t a sqrt(t) + 576 t\u00b2 - 100 t.\n\nSubtracting t * equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n(a\u00b2 t - 48 a sqrt(t) - 324 t + 576) - (t a\u00b2 - 48 t a sqrt(t) + 576 t\u00b2 - 100 t) = 0.\n\nCompute term by term:\n\na\u00b2 t - t a\u00b2 = 0.\n\n-48 a sqrt(t) - (-48 t a sqrt(t)) = -48 a sqrt(t) + 48 t a sqrt(t) = 48 a sqrt(t) (t - 1).\n\n-324 t - (-100 t) = -324 t + 100 t = -224 t.\n\n576 - 576 t\u00b2 = 576(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n48 a sqrt(t) (t - 1) - 224 t + 576 (1 - t\u00b2) = 0.\n\nLet me factor 48 from the first term:\n\n48 a sqrt(t) (t - 1) - 224 t + 576 (1 - t\u00b2) = 0.\n\nLet me factor 16 from each term to simplify:\n\n16 [ 3 a sqrt(t) (t - 1) - 14 t + 36 (1 - t\u00b2) ] = 0.\n\nSo, 3 a sqrt(t) (t - 1) - 14 t + 36 (1 - t\u00b2) = 0.\n\nHmm, this seems manageable.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n3 a sqrt(t) (t - 1) = 14 t - 36 (1 - t\u00b2).\n\nCompute RHS:\n\n14 t - 36 + 36 t\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n3 a sqrt(t) (t - 1) = 36 t\u00b2 + 14 t - 36.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n3 a sqrt(t) (t - 1) = 36 t\u00b2 + 14 t - 36.\n\nLet me denote s = sqrt(t). So, s = sqrt(t) => t = s\u00b2.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n3 a s (s\u00b2 - 1) = 36 s^4 + 14 s\u00b2 - 36.\n\nSo,\n\n3 a s (s\u00b2 - 1) = 36 s^4 + 14 s\u00b2 - 36.\n\nDivide both sides by common factors if possible. Let's see, 3 is a common factor on LHS.\n\nHmm, 36 is divisible by 3, 14 isn't, but let's see:\n\n3 a s (s\u00b2 - 1) = 36 s^4 + 14 s\u00b2 - 36.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n3 a s (s\u00b2 - 1) = 36 s^4 + 14 s\u00b2 - 36.\n\nHmm, perhaps express a from equation (1) and substitute.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\na\u00b2 - 48 a sqrt(t) + 576 t - 100 = 0.\n\nSubstitute t = s\u00b2, sqrt(t) = s:\n\na\u00b2 - 48 a s + 576 s\u00b2 - 100 = 0.\n\nThis is a quadratic in a:\n\na\u00b2 - 48 s a + (576 s\u00b2 - 100) = 0.\n\nWe can solve for a using quadratic formula:\n\na = [48 s \u00b1 sqrt( (48 s)^2 - 4 * 1 * (576 s\u00b2 - 100) ) ] / 2.\n\nCompute discriminant D:\n\n(48 s)^2 - 4 * 1 * (576 s\u00b2 - 100) = 2304 s\u00b2 - 2304 s\u00b2 + 400 = 400.\n\nSo,\n\na = [48 s \u00b1 sqrt(400)] / 2 = [48 s \u00b1 20 ] / 2 = 24 s \u00b1 10.\n\nSo, a = 24 s + 10 or a = 24 s - 10.\n\nBut since a is the length of AB in the rectangle, which is positive, and s = sqrt(t) is positive, we have a = 24 s + 10 or a = 24 s -10.\n\nBut a must be greater than x, as X is inside the rectangle, so a must be greater than y\u00b2 / x, but given that, a = 24 s - 10 must be positive, so 24 s >10 => s > 10/24 = 5/12. So, possible.\n\nSo, we have two possibilities: a =24 s +10 or a=24 s -10.\n\nLet me proceed with each case.\n\nCase 1: a =24 s +10.\n\nFrom the earlier equation:\n\n3 a s (s\u00b2 -1) =36 s^4 +14 s\u00b2 -36.\n\nSubstitute a:\n\n3*(24 s +10)*s*(s\u00b2 -1) =36 s^4 +14 s\u00b2 -36.\n\nCompute LHS:\n\n3*(24 s +10)*s*(s\u00b2 -1) = 3*(24 s^2 +10 s)*(s\u00b2 -1) = 3*(24 s^4 +10 s^2 -24 s^2 -10 s ) = 3*(24 s^4 -14 s^2 -10 s ) =72 s^4 -42 s^2 -30 s.\n\nSet equal to RHS:\n\n72 s^4 -42 s^2 -30 s =36 s^4 +14 s^2 -36.\n\nBring all terms to LHS:\n\n72 s^4 -42 s^2 -30 s -36 s^4 -14 s^2 +36=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(72 s^4 -36 s^4) + (-42 s^2 -14 s^2) + (-30 s) +36=0.\n\nWhich is:\n\n36 s^4 -56 s^2 -30 s +36=0.\n\nThis is a quartic equation, but perhaps factorable.\n\nLet me try to factor this.\n\n36 s^4 -56 s^2 -30 s +36.\n\nHmm, perhaps group terms:\n\n(36 s^4 -56 s^2 +36) -30 s.\n\nWait, 36 s^4 -56 s^2 +36 can be factored.\n\nLet me compute discriminant for 36 s^4 -56 s^2 +36.\n\nWait, it's a quadratic in s\u00b2: 36 (s\u00b2)^2 -56 s\u00b2 +36.\n\nDiscriminant D = (-56)^2 -4*36*36 =3136 - 5184= -2048.\n\nNegative discriminant, so it doesn't factor into real terms. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe try to factor the quartic as (a s^2 +b s +c)(d s^2 +e s +f).\n\nBut this might take time. Alternatively, maybe use rational root theorem.\n\nPossible rational roots are factors of 36 over factors of 36: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, etc., but given the equation is in s, let's try s=1:\n\n36(1)^4 -56(1)^2 -30(1) +36=36 -56 -30 +36= -14.

So, this is also a valid solution.\n\nSo, both s\u22481.74 and s\u22480.847 are solutions.\n\nNow, we need to find which one is valid.\n\nBut let's recall that in the rectangle, point X is inside, so coordinates x and y must satisfy 0 < x < a and 0 < y <24.\n\nFrom earlier, we had:\n\ny\u00b2 = t x\u00b2, where t = s\u00b2.\n\nSo, y = s x.\n\nAlso, from the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a x, which is x\u00b2 + s\u00b2 x\u00b2 =a x =>x(1 +s\u00b2)=a x =>1 +s\u00b2 =a.\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, no, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a x.\n\nBut y = s x, so x\u00b2 + s\u00b2 x\u00b2 =a x.\n\nFactor x\u00b2: x\u00b2(1 + s\u00b2) =a x.\n\nDivide both sides by x (x\u22600):\n\nx(1 + s\u00b2)=a.\n\nSo, x= a/(1 + s\u00b2).\n\nSo, x must be less than a, so 1 +s\u00b2 >1, which is always true as s>0.\n\nAlso, y= s x =s a/(1 + s\u00b2).\n\nWhich must be less than24.\n\nSo, y= (s a)/(1 + s\u00b2) <24.\n\nSo, for each solution of s, we can compute a and check if y <24.\n\nFirst, let's take s=(7 +sqrt(193))/12\u22481.74.\n\nCompute a\u224831.76.\n\nCompute y= s a/(1 +s\u00b2)=1.74*31.76/(1 + (1.74)^2).\n\nCompute denominator:1 +3.0276\u22484.0276.\n\nSo, y\u2248(1.74*31.76)/4.0276\u2248(55.2984)/4.0276\u224813.73.\n\nWhich is less than24. So, valid.\n\nSecond, s\u22480.847.\n\nCompute a\u224810.328.\n\nCompute y= s a/(1 +s\u00b2)=0.847*10.328/(1 +0.717).\n\nCompute denominator\u22481.717.\n\nCompute numerator\u22480.847*10.328\u22488.766.\n\nSo, y\u22488.766 /1.717\u22485.108.\n\nWhich is less than24. So, also valid.\n\nSo, both solutions are possible. Hmm, but how to choose which one is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps we can check the original triangles AXD and BXC are acute.\n\nGiven that, we need to ensure that all angles in both triangles are less than90 degrees.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the position of X is such that in one solution, X is too close to a corner, making one triangle obtuse.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both solutions are valid, but maybe only one gives integer or nice fractional value for a.\n\nWait, let's compute more accurately.\n\nFirst, for s=(7 +sqrt(193))/12.\n\nCompute sqrt(193)=approx13.890.\n\nSo, s=(7 +13.890)/12\u224820.890/12\u22481.7408.\n\nThen, a=24 s -10\u224824*1.7408 -10\u224841.779 -10\u224831.779.\n\nCompute y= s a/(1 +s\u00b2)=1.7408*31.779/(1 + (1.7408)^2).\n\nCompute s\u00b2\u22483.030.\n\nSo, denominator\u22484.030.\n\nNumerator\u22481.7408*31.779\u224855.31.\n\nSo, y\u224855.31 /4.030\u224813.72.\n\nSo, y\u224813.72, which is less than24. So, valid.\n\nSimilarly, compute x= a/(1 +s\u00b2)=31.779/(1 +3.030)\u224831.779/4.030\u22487.884.\n\nSo, x\u22487.884, which is less than a\u224831.779, so valid.\n\nNow, check if triangle AXD is acute.\n\nIn triangle AXD, sides are AX, XD, AD=24.\n\nCompute AX= sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=sqrt(7.884\u00b2 +13.72\u00b2)\u2248sqrt(62.16 + 188.23)=sqrt(250.39)\u224815.82.\n\nXD= sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2)=sqrt(62.16 + (24 -13.72)^2)=sqrt(62.16 + (10.28)^2)=sqrt(62.16 +105.67)=sqrt(167.83\u224812.95.\n\nAD=24.\n\nSo, sides\u224815.82,12.95,24.\n\nCheck if all angles are acute.\n\nUse the law of cosines: for each angle, the cosine should be positive.\n\nAlternatively, for a triangle with sides a,b,c, it's acute if a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 >c\u00b2 for all combinations.\n\nCheck for the largest side, which is24.\n\nCheck 15.82\u00b2 +12.95\u00b2 >24\u00b2.\n\n15.82\u00b2\u2248250.39;12.95\u00b2\u2248167.7.\n\n250.39 +167.7\u2248418.09.\n\n24\u00b2=576.\n\n418.09 <576. So, 24\u00b2 >15.82\u00b2 +12.95\u00b2. Thus, the angle opposite 24 is obtuse.\n\nBut the problem states that triangle AXD is acute. So, this solution leads to an obtuse triangle, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, this solution is invalid.\n\nNow, check the other solution: s=(-1 +sqrt(37))/6\u2248( -1 +6.082)/6\u22485.082/6\u22480.847.\n\nCompute a=24 s -10\u224824*0.847 -10\u224820.328 -10\u224810.328.\n\nCompute y= s a/(1 +s\u00b2)=0.847*10.328/(1 +0.717)=approx8.766 /1.717\u22485.108.\n\nCompute x= a/(1 +s\u00b2)=10.328/(1 +0.717)=10.328/1.717\u22486.016.\n\nSo, x\u22486.016, y\u22485.108.\n\nCheck if triangle AXD is acute.\n\nCompute sides:\n\nAX= sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=sqrt(6.016\u00b2 +5.108\u00b2)=sqrt(36.19 +26.09)=sqrt(62.28\u22487.89.\n\nXD= sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2)=sqrt(36.19 + (24 -5.108)^2)=sqrt(36.19 + (18.892)^2)=sqrt(36.19 +356.85)=sqrt(393.04\u224819.825.\n\nAD=24.\n\nSo, sides\u22487.89,19.825,24.\n\nCheck if all angles are acute.\n\nCheck for the largest side,24:\n\n7.89\u00b2 +19.825\u00b2\u224862.25 +393.04\u2248455.29.\n\nCompare to24\u00b2=576.\n\n455.29 <576. So, angle opposite24 is obtuse. But problem states triangle AXD is acute. So, invalid.\n\nWait, both solutions lead to triangle AXD having an obtuse angle. That's a problem.\n\nHmm, what did I do wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that a=24 s -10. Alternatively, maybe I should have taken a=24 s +10.\n\nWait, earlier when I solved equation (1), I found a=24 s \u00b110. But when I took a=24 s -10, both solutions lead to triangle AXD being obtuse, which is not allowed.\n\nWhat if I take a=24 s +10? Let me check.\n\nCase 1: a=24 s +10.\n\nFrom equation:\n\n3 a s (s\u00b2 -1)=36 s^4 +14 s\u00b2 -36.\n\nSubstitute a=24 s +10:\n\n3*(24 s +10)*s*(s\u00b2 -1)=36 s^4 +14 s\u00b2 -36.\n\nCompute LHS:\n\n3*(24 s +10)*s*(s\u00b2 -1)=3*(24 s^2 +10 s)*(s\u00b2 -1)=3*(24 s^4 +10 s^2 -24 s^2 -10 s)=3*(24 s^4 -14 s^2 -10 s)=72 s^4 -42 s^2 -30 s.\n\nSet equal to RHS:\n\n72 s^4 -42 s^2 -30 s =36 s^4 +14 s^2 -36.\n\nBring all terms to LHS:\n\n72 s^4 -42 s^2 -30 s -36 s^4 -14 s^2 +36=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n36 s^4 -56 s^2 -30 s +36=0.\n\nWhich is the quartic equation we had earlier, which didn't factor nicely.\n\nBut perhaps, let's try s=1:\n\n36 -56 -30 +36= -14\u22600.\n\ns=2:36*16 -56*4 -30*2 +36=576 -224 -60 +36=328\u22600.\n\ns=3/2:36*(81/16) -56*(9/4) -30*(3/2) +36= 182.25 -126 -45 +36=47.25\u22600.\n\ns= sqrt(2): approx1.414.\n\nCompute 36*(4) -56*(2) -30*(1.414)+36=144 -112 -42.42 +36=144-112=32, 32-42.42\u2248-10.42, -10.42+36\u224825.58\u22600.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps take s= sqrt(3)\u22481.732.\n\n36*(9) -56*(3) -30*(1.732)+36=324 -168 -51.96 +36=324-168=156, 156-51.96\u2248104.04, 104.04+36\u2248140.04\u22600.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a quartic, maybe use substitution z=s\u00b2.\n\nThen, equation becomes 36 z\u00b2 -56 z -30 sqrt(z) +36=0.\n\nHmm, introduces sqrt(z), complicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use rational root theorem for the quartic 36 s^4 -56 s^2 -30 s +36=0.\n\nPossible roots are factors of 36 over factors of 36, but earlier tried s=1,2,3,1/2, etc., didn't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use numerical methods.\n\nLet me try s=1.5:\n\n36*(5.0625) -56*(2.25) -30*(1.5) +36\u2248182.25 -126 -45 +36\u224847.25\u22600.\n\ns=1.2:\n\n36*(2.0736) -56*(1.44) -30*(1.2)+36\u224874.6256 -80.64 -36 +36\u224874.6256-80.64\u2248-6.0144\u22600.\n\ns=1.3:\n\n36*(2.8561)\u2248102.8196;

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of AB in rectangle ABCD where BC is 24. Let me try to visualize the rectangle first. So, ABCD is a rectangle, which means all angles are right angles, and opposite sides are equal. That means AB is equal to CD, and BC is equal to AD. Given that BC is 24, so AD is also 24. \n\nPoint X is inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. Hmm, so point X lies somewhere inside the rectangle where if you connect points A and B to X, you get a right angle at X. That probably means that triangle AXB is a right-angled triangle.\n\nAlso, it's given that triangles AXD and BXC are both acute and have circumradii 13 and 15, respectively. So, the circumradius of triangle AXD is 13, and the circumradius of triangle BXC is 15. \n\nI remember that in any triangle, the circumradius R can be found using the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*A), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle and A is its area. Alternatively, if the triangle is acute, the circumradius can also be related to the sides and the angles. Maybe I can use some properties of the circumradius here.\n\nBut since both triangles AXD and BXC are acute, that tells me that their circumcenters lie inside the triangles. Hmm, maybe that fact will come into play later.\n\nLet me try to assign some coordinates to make this easier. Let's place the rectangle ABCD on a coordinate system. Let me assign point A at (0, 0), which would make point B at (AB, 0), point C at (AB, BC) = (AB, 24), and point D at (0, 24).\n\nThen, point X is somewhere inside the rectangle. Let me denote the coordinates of X as (x, y). Since angle AXB is 90 degrees, the vectors AX and BX should be perpendicular. So, the dot product of vectors AX and BX should be zero.\n\nVector AX is from A to X, which is (x, y). Vector BX is from B to X, which is (x - AB, y). So, the dot product is x*(x - AB) + y*y = 0.\n\nSo, that gives me the equation:\n\nx(x - AB) + y^2 = 0\n=> x^2 - AB*x + y^2 = 0\n\nThat's one equation involving x, y, and AB.\n\nNow, let's think about the triangles AXD and BXC. Both have given circumradii.\n\nStarting with triangle AXD. Its vertices are A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24). Let me find the lengths of the sides of triangle AXD.\n\nSide AX: distance from A to X is sqrt(x^2 + y^2)\nSide XD: distance from X to D is sqrt((0 - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2) = sqrt(x^2 + (24 - y)^2)\nSide AD: distance from A to D is 24.\n\nWait, but triangle AXD has sides of length sqrt(x^2 + y^2), sqrt(x^2 + (24 - y)^2), and 24. The circumradius R for triangle AXD is 13.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC, the vertices are B(AB, 0), X(x,y), C(AB,24). So, sides:\n\nBX: distance from B to X is sqrt((AB - x)^2 + y^2)\nXC: distance from X to C is sqrt((AB - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2)\nBC: distance from B to C is 24.\n\nCircumradius R for triangle BXC is 15.\n\nSo, for both triangles, I can use the formula for circumradius in terms of side lengths. Let me recall the formula:\n\nR = (a*b*c)/(4*A), where a, b, c are sides, and A is the area.\n\nAlternatively, since both triangles are acute, maybe there's another formula that could be useful.\n\nWait, I also remember that in any triangle, the circumradius can be given by R = a/(2*sin(A)), where a is the length of a side and A is the angle opposite that side.\n\nSince both triangles are acute, all angles are less than 90 degrees, so their sines are positive.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is directly helpful yet. Maybe I can compute the area in terms of coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry to find the circumradius.\n\nWait, for triangle AXD, the circumradius is 13. Let me denote the sides as follows:\n\nLet me denote side AX as a, XD as b, and AD as c. So,\n\na = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)\nb = sqrt(x^2 + (24 - y)^2)\nc = 24\n\nSimilarly, for triangle AXD, the circumradius R is given by 13. So,\n\nR = (a * b * c)/(4 * area)\n\nFirst, I need to find the area of triangle AXD. Since A is at (0,0), X is at (x,y), and D is at (0,24), the area can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle with coordinates.\n\nArea = (1/2)| (x*(24 - y) - 0*(x - 0) + 0*(y - 24) ) | = (1/2)|24x - xy| = (1/2)|x(24 - y)|.\n\nSince X is inside the rectangle, x is between 0 and AB, and y is between 0 and 24, so 24 - y is positive. So, the area is (1/2)x(24 - y).\n\nSo, area = (1/2)x(24 - y).\n\nSo, plugging into the formula for R:\n\n13 = (a * b * c)/(4 * area) = (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) * sqrt(x^2 + (24 - y)^2) * 24 ) / (4 * (1/2)x(24 - y))\n\nSimplify denominator: 4*(1/2)x(24 - y) = 2x(24 - y)\n\nSo, 13 = (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) * sqrt(x^2 + (24 - y)^2) *24 )/(2x(24 - y))\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n24 / 2 = 12, so numerator becomes 12*sqrt(x^2 + y^2)*sqrt(x^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nDenominator: x(24 - y)\n\nSo,\n\n13 = [12 * sqrt(x^2 + y^2) * sqrt(x^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ] / [x(24 - y)]\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n13^2 = [12^2 * (x^2 + y^2) * (x^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ] / [x^2 (24 - y)^2 ]\n\n169 = [144 * (x^2 + y^2)(x^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ] / [x^2 (24 - y)^2 ]\n\nMultiply both sides by x^2 (24 - y)^2:\n\n169 * x^2 (24 - y)^2 = 144 * (x^2 + y^2)(x^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can denote some variables to simplify this.\n\nLet me let u = x^2, v = y^2, w = (24 - y)^2. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n169 * u * w = 144 * (u + v)(u + w)\n\nWait, but that might not necessarily make it easier. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator.\n\nNotice that (x^2 + y^2) and (x^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) can be written as:\n\nx^2 + y^2 and x^2 + (24 - y)^2.\n\nLet me compute the product:\n\n(x^2 + y^2)(x^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = x^4 + x^2(24 - y)^2 + x^2 y^2 + y^2(24 - y)^2\n\nWait, but that's a bit messy. Maybe I can think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor the equation as:\n\n169 * x^2 (24 - y)^2 = 144 * [x^2 + y^2][x^2 + (24 - y)^2 ]\n\nLet me bring everything to one side:\n\n169 x^2 (24 - y)^2 - 144 (x^2 + y^2)(x^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 0\n\nFactor out (24 - y)^2:\n\n(24 - y)^2 [169 x^2 - 144 (x^2 + y^2)] = 0\n\nWait, is that possible? Let me check.\n\nWait, no. Because the second term is 144 multiplied by (x^2 + y^2)(x^2 + (24 - y)^2 ), which doesn't factor out (24 - y)^2. So my previous step was incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote t = 24 - y. Then t is the distance from y to 24, so t is between 0 and 24 as well.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n169 x^2 t^2 = 144 (x^2 + y^2)(x^2 + t^2 )\n\nBut I don't see an immediate simplification.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the equation as:\n\n[169 x^2 t^2 ] / [ (x^2 + y^2)(x^2 + t^2 ) ] = 144\n\nBut 169 is 13^2 and 144 is 12^2. Maybe that's a clue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the ratio (x^2 + y^2)/(x^2 + t^2) as something. Let me compute that:\n\n(x^2 + y^2)/(x^2 + t^2) = (x^2 + y^2)/(x^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the equation we had earlier from angle AXB being 90 degrees.\n\nWe had x^2 - AB x + y^2 = 0.\n\nWhich can be written as x^2 + y^2 = AB x.\n\nSo, x^2 + y^2 = AB x.\n\nHmm, that is helpful because in the equation for triangle AXD, we have (x^2 + y^2) as AB x.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC, maybe I can find a similar equation.\n\nSo, let's write down what we have so far.\n\nFrom angle AXB being 90 degrees: x^2 + y^2 = AB x. So, x^2 + y^2 = AB x. Let's call this Equation (1).\n\nNow, back to the equation involving the circumradius of triangle AXD:\n\n169 x^2 (24 - y)^2 = 144 (x^2 + y^2)(x^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nBut from Equation (1), x^2 + y^2 = AB x. So, substituting that into the equation:\n\n169 x^2 (24 - y)^2 = 144 (AB x)(x^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nLet me write that:\n\n169 x^2 t^2 = 144 AB x (x^2 + t^2 )\n\nWhere t = 24 - y.\n\nDivide both sides by x (assuming x \u2260 0, which it isn't because X is inside the rectangle, so x is between 0 and AB):\n\n169 x t^2 = 144 AB (x^2 + t^2 )\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\n169 x t^2 - 144 AB (x^2 + t^2 ) = 0\n\nFactor:\n\nx t^2 (169) - 144 AB x^2 - 144 AB t^2 = 0\n\nHmm, not sure. Let me factor terms:\n\nIt's 169 x t^2 - 144 AB x^2 - 144 AB t^2 = 0.\n\nI can factor x from the first two terms:\n\nx(169 t^2 - 144 AB x) - 144 AB t^2 = 0\n\nNot sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express AB in terms of x and y from Equation (1). Since x^2 + y^2 = AB x, so AB = (x^2 + y^2)/x.\n\nSo, AB = (x^2 + y^2)/x.\n\nBut t = 24 - y, so y = 24 - t.\n\nSo, AB = (x^2 + (24 - t)^2 ) / x.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the same approach for triangle BXC.\n\nTriangle BXC has vertices at B(AB, 0), X(x,y), and C(AB,24). So, the sides:\n\nBX: sqrt( (AB - x)^2 + y^2 )\nXC: sqrt( (AB - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\nBC: 24.\n\nCircumradius is 15.\n\nSo, using the same formula:\n\nR = (a*b*c)/(4*A)\n\nFirst, compute the area of triangle BXC. Points are B(AB,0), X(x,y), C(AB,24).\n\nSo, the area can be found using the coordinates. Using the shoelace formula:\n\nArea = (1/2)| (AB*(y - 24) + x*(24 - 0) + AB*(0 - y) ) |.\n\nWait, let's compute it step by step.\n\nThe area is (1/2)| (AB*(y - 24) + x*(24 - 0) + AB*(0 - y) ) |.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1/2)| AB y - 24 AB + 24 x - AB y |\n= (1/2)| (-24 AB + 24 x ) |\n= (1/2)|24(x - AB)|\n= 12 |x - AB|\n\nSince x is between 0 and AB, x - AB is negative, so the absolute value becomes AB - x.\n\nSo, area = 12 (AB - x).\n\nNow, the sides:\n\na = BX = sqrt( (AB - x)^2 + y^2 )\nb = XC = sqrt( (AB - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\nc = BC = 24\n\nCircumradius R = 15, so:\n\n15 = (a * b * c)/(4 * area) = ( sqrt( (AB - x)^2 + y^2 ) * sqrt( (AB - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) * 24 ) / (4 * 12 (AB - x) )\n\nSimplify denominator: 4*12 (AB - x) = 48 (AB - x)\n\nSo,\n\n15 = [ sqrt( (AB - x)^2 + y^2 ) * sqrt( (AB - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) *24 ] / [48 (AB - x)]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n24 / 48 = 1/2, so:\n\n15 = [ sqrt( (AB - x)^2 + y^2 ) * sqrt( (AB - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) * (1/2) ] / (AB - x )\n\nWait, that is:\n\n15 = [ (1/2) * sqrt( (AB - x)^2 + y^2 ) * sqrt( (AB - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ] / (AB - x )\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nMultiply both sides by 2(AB - x):\n\n30 (AB - x) = sqrt( (AB - x)^2 + y^2 ) * sqrt( (AB - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n[30 (AB - x)]^2 = [ (AB - x)^2 + y^2 ] * [ (AB - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ]\n\nLet me compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: 900 (AB - x)^2\n\nRight side: [ (AB - x)^2 + y^2 ] [ (AB - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ]\n\nLet me denote s = AB - x, and t = 24 - y (same t as before). Then, the equation becomes:\n\n900 s^2 = (s^2 + y^2)(s^2 + t^2 )\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n= s^4 + s^2 t^2 + s^2 y^2 + y^2 t^2\n\n= s^4 + s^2(t^2 + y^2) + y^2 t^2\n\nSo, equation:\n\n900 s^2 = s^4 + s^2(t^2 + y^2) + y^2 t^2\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\ns^4 + s^2(t^2 + y^2) + y^2 t^2 - 900 s^2 = 0\n\nFactor:\n\ns^4 + s^2(t^2 + y^2 - 900) + y^2 t^2 = 0\n\nHmm, this is a quartic equation in s, which might not be easy to solve. But maybe we can relate it with earlier equations.\n\nWait, let's recall that from triangle AXD, we had:\n\n169 x^2 t^2 = 144 AB (x^2 + t^2 ) * x\n\nWait, no, that was a different equation. Let me see.\n\nWait, earlier we had for triangle AXD:\n\n169 x^2 t^2 = 144 AB (x^2 + t^2 ) * x\n\nWait, no, that was:\n\nFrom triangle AXD:\n\n169 x^2 t^2 = 144 (x^2 + y^2)(x^2 + t^2 )\n\nBut from Equation (1), x^2 + y^2 = AB x, so substituting that:\n\n169 x^2 t^2 = 144 AB x (x^2 + t^2 )\n\nDivide both sides by x (since x \u2260 0):\n\n169 x t^2 = 144 AB (x^2 + t^2 )\n\nSo,\n\n169 x t^2 = 144 AB (x^2 + t^2 )\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n169 x t^2 = 144 AB (x^2 + t^2 )\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n169 x t^2 - 144 AB x^2 - 144 AB t^2 = 0\n\nFactor:\n\nx(169 t^2 - 144 AB x ) - 144 AB t^2 = 0\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me solve for AB:\n\nAB = (169 x t^2 )/(144 (x^2 + t^2 ) )\n\nSimilarly, from triangle BXC, we have:\n\n900 s^2 = (s^2 + y^2)(s^2 + t^2 )\n\nBut s = AB - x, and t = 24 - y.\n\nSo, s = AB - x.\n\nSo, s^2 + y^2 = (AB - x)^2 + y^2 = AB^2 - 2 AB x + x^2 + y^2.\n\nBut from Equation (1), x^2 + y^2 = AB x, so:\n\ns^2 + y^2 = AB^2 - 2 AB x + AB x = AB^2 - AB x.\n\nSimilarly, s^2 + t^2 = (AB - x)^2 + t^2 = AB^2 - 2 AB x + x^2 + t^2.\n\nBut t = 24 - y, so t^2 = (24 - y)^2.\n\nAlso, from Equation (1), x^2 + y^2 = AB x, which gives x^2 = AB x - y^2.\n\nSo, x^2 + t^2 = AB x - y^2 + t^2.\n\nBut t^2 = (24 - y)^2 = 576 - 48 y + y^2.\n\nSo, x^2 + t^2 = AB x - y^2 + 576 - 48 y + y^2 = AB x + 576 - 48 y.\n\nHmm, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nWait, let's try to substitute s and t into the equation:\n\n900 s^2 = (s^2 + y^2)(s^2 + t^2 )\n\nFrom earlier, s^2 + y^2 = AB^2 - AB x.\n\nSimilarly, s^2 + t^2 = AB^2 - 2 AB x + x^2 + t^2.\n\nBut x^2 + t^2 = x^2 + (24 - y)^2.\n\nWait, from Equation (1), x^2 + y^2 = AB x, so x^2 = AB x - y^2. Therefore, x^2 + t^2 = AB x - y^2 + (24 - y)^2.\n\nCompute (24 - y)^2: 576 - 48 y + y^2.\n\nSo, x^2 + t^2 = AB x - y^2 + 576 - 48 y + y^2 = AB x + 576 - 48 y.\n\nSo, s^2 + t^2 = (AB - x)^2 + t^2 = AB^2 - 2 AB x + x^2 + t^2 = AB^2 - 2 AB x + (x^2 + t^2 ) = AB^2 - 2 AB x + AB x + 576 - 48 y.\n\nWait, because x^2 + t^2 = AB x + 576 - 48 y.\n\nSo, s^2 + t^2 = AB^2 - 2 AB x + AB x + 576 - 48 y = AB^2 - AB x + 576 - 48 y.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I can express AB in terms of x and y from Equation (1): AB = (x^2 + y^2)/x.\n\nSo, AB = x + (y^2)/x.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express AB in terms of s and t.\n\nWait, s = AB - x, so AB = s + x.\n\nSimilarly, t = 24 - y.\n\nSo, y = 24 - t.\n\nSo, AB = s + x.\n\nFrom Equation (1):\n\nx^2 + y^2 = AB x.\n\nSubstitute y = 24 - t and AB = s + x:\n\nx^2 + (24 - t)^2 = (s + x) x.\n\nExpand (24 - t)^2: 576 - 48 t + t^2.\n\nSo,\n\nx^2 + 576 - 48 t + t^2 = s x + x^2\n\nSubtract x^2 from both sides:\n\n576 - 48 t + t^2 = s x.\n\nSo,\n\ns x = 576 - 48 t + t^2.\n\nBut s = AB - x, and AB = s + x.\n\nWait, this seems circular.\n\nAlternatively, since s x = 576 - 48 t + t^2, and s = AB - x, maybe we can write:\n\n(AB - x) x = 576 - 48 t + t^2\n\nSo,\n\nAB x - x^2 = 576 - 48 t + t^2.\n\nBut from Equation (1): x^2 + y^2 = AB x, so AB x = x^2 + y^2.\n\nSubstituting AB x = x^2 + y^2 into the equation:\n\n(x^2 + y^2) - x^2 = 576 - 48 t + t^2.\n\nSimplify:\n\ny^2 = 576 - 48 t + t^2.\n\nBut y = 24 - t, so y = 24 - t.\n\nCompute y^2: (24 - t)^2 = 576 - 48 t + t^2.\n\nWhich is exactly the right-hand side. So,\n\ny^2 = 576 - 48 t + t^2.\n\nWhich is an identity, so that doesn't give us new information.\n\nHmm, seems like I'm going in circles here.\n\nMaybe I should consider both equations from the circumradius of triangle AXD and BXC, and try to find a relationship between x and y, and then solve for AB.\n\nLet me recap.\n\nFrom triangle AXD, we have:\n\n169 x t^2 = 144 AB (x^2 + t^2 )\n\nFrom triangle BXC, we have:\n\n900 s^2 = (s^2 + y^2)(s^2 + t^2 )\n\nBut s = AB - x, and t = 24 - y.\n\nAdditionally, from Equation (1): x^2 + y^2 = AB x.\n\nLet me try to write AB from Equation (1):\n\nAB = (x^2 + y^2)/x.\n\nSo, let's substitute AB into the equation from triangle AXD:\n\n169 x t^2 = 144 * (x^2 + y^2)/x * (x^2 + t^2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by x:\n\n169 x^2 t^2 = 144 (x^2 + y^2)(x^2 + t^2 )\n\nBut from Equation (1), x^2 + y^2 = AB x, which is equal to (x^2 + y^2) as per the equation. Wait, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express x^2 + t^2.\n\nx^2 + t^2 = x^2 + (24 - y)^2.\n\nWhich, from Equation (1), x^2 + y^2 = AB x.\n\nSo, x^2 + t^2 = AB x - y^2 + t^2.\n\nBut t = 24 - y, so t^2 = (24 - y)^2 = 576 - 48 y + y^2.\n\nThus, x^2 + t^2 = AB x - y^2 + 576 - 48 y + y^2 = AB x + 576 - 48 y.\n\nSo, x^2 + t^2 = AB x + 576 - 48 y.\n\nTherefore, the equation from triangle AXD becomes:\n\n169 x^2 t^2 = 144 (x^2 + y^2)(x^2 + t^2 ) = 144 AB x (AB x + 576 - 48 y )\n\nWait, that might be helpful.\n\nSo,\n\n169 x^2 t^2 = 144 AB x (AB x + 576 - 48 y )\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n169 x^2 t^2 = 144 AB^2 x^2 + 144 AB x (576 - 48 y )\n\nHmm, now, from Equation (1), AB x = x^2 + y^2.\n\nSo, substituting AB x = x^2 + y^2 into the equation:\n\n169 x^2 t^2 = 144 (x^2 + y^2) AB x + 144 AB x (576 - 48 y )\n\nBut AB x = x^2 + y^2, so:\n\n169 x^2 t^2 = 144 (x^2 + y^2)(x^2 + y^2) + 144 (x^2 + y^2)(576 - 48 y )\n\nFactor out 144 (x^2 + y^2):\n\n169 x^2 t^2 = 144 (x^2 + y^2)[ (x^2 + y^2 ) + (576 - 48 y ) ]\n\nHmm, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that both triangles AXD and BXC are acute. In an acute triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides by the formula R = a/(2 sin A), where A is the angle opposite side a. Since all angles are acute, each angle is less than 90 degrees, so their sines are less than 1. But I'm not sure how to use this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry to find the circumradius.\n\nFor triangle AXD, with points A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24), the circumradius can be found using the formula for the circumradius of a triangle given by coordinates.\n\nThe formula for the circumradius of a triangle with vertices (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) is:\n\nR = \\frac{ \\sqrt{ (|x2 - x1|^2 + |y2 - y1|^2)(|x3 - x1|^2 + |y3 - y1|^2)(|x3 - x2|^2 + |y3 - y2|^2) } }{ 4 * Area }\n\nBut that's the same as the formula I used earlier. Maybe it's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the equation of the circumcircle of triangle AXD and find its radius.\n\nThe circumcircle of triangle AXD can be found by finding the perpendicular bisectors of two sides and finding their intersection.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, find the midpoint and slope of AX and XD.\n\nMidpoint of AX: (x/2, y/2). Slope of AX: (y - 0)/(x - 0) = y/x. So, the perpendicular bisector will have slope -x/y.\n\nEquation of perpendicular bisector of AX: y - y/2 = (-x/y)(x - x/2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\ny - y/2 = (-x/y)(x/2 )\n\n=> y/2 = (-x^2)/(2 y )\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 y:\n\ny^2 = -x^2\n\nBut that's impossible unless x = y = 0, which can't be since X is inside the rectangle. So, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, the midpoint is (x/2, y/2). The perpendicular bisector equation is:\n\n(y' - y/2) = (-x/y)(x' - x/2 )\n\nYes, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, find the perpendicular bisector of XD.\n\nMidpoint of XD: (x/2, (y + 24)/2 ). Slope of XD: (24 - y)/(0 - x ) = (24 - y)/(-x ) = (y - 24)/x. So, the perpendicular bisector will have slope -x/(y - 24 ).\n\nEquation of perpendicular bisector of XD:\n\n(y' - (y + 24)/2 ) = [ -x/(y - 24) ] (x' - x/2 )\n\nNow, to find the circumradius, we need to find the intersection point of these two perpendicular bisectors, which will be the circumcenter. Then, the distance from the circumcenter to any vertex will be the radius.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe I can proceed.\n\nLet me denote the circumcenter as (h, k). Then,\n\nFrom the perpendicular bisector of AX:\n\nk - y/2 = (-x/y)(h - x/2 )\n\nFrom the perpendicular bisector of XD:\n\nk - (y + 24)/2 = [ -x/(y - 24) ] (h - x/2 )\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) k = (-x/y)(h - x/2 ) + y/2\n\n2) k = [ -x/(y - 24) ] (h - x/2 ) + (y + 24)/2\n\nSet them equal:\n\n(-x/y)(h - x/2 ) + y/2 = [ -x/(y - 24) ] (h - x/2 ) + (y + 24)/2\n\nLet me denote (h - x/2 ) as z. Then,\n\n(-x/y) z + y/2 = (-x/(y - 24)) z + (y + 24)/2\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n[ (-x/y) z + y/2 ] - [ (-x/(y - 24)) z + (y + 24)/2 ] = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-x/y + x/(y - 24)) z + (y/2 - (y +24)/2 ) = 0\n\nCompute the coefficients:\n\nCoefficient of z:\n\nx [ -1/y + 1/(y - 24) ) ] = x [ (- (y - 24) + y ) / (y(y - 24)) ) ] = x [ ( -y + 24 + y ) / (y(y - 24)) ) ] = x [ 24 / (y(y - 24)) ) ] = 24 x / (y(y - 24))\n\nConstant term:\n\n(y/2 - (y +24)/2 ) = (y - y -24)/2 = (-24)/2 = -12\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(24 x / (y(y - 24)) ) z - 12 = 0\n\nSolve for z:\n\n(24 x / (y(y - 24)) ) z = 12\n\n=> z = [12 * y(y - 24) ] / (24 x )\n\nSimplify:\n\nz = [ y(y -24) ] / (2 x )\n\nBut z = h - x/2, so:\n\nh - x/2 = [ y(y -24) ] / (2 x )\n\nThus,\n\nh = x/2 + [ y(y -24) ] / (2 x )\n\nSimilarly, from equation (1):\n\nh = x/2 + [ y(y -24) ] / (2 x )\n\nNow, substitute h into equation 1 to find k.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nk = (-x/y)(h - x/2 ) + y/2\n\nBut h - x/2 = [ y(y -24) ] / (2 x )\n\nSo,\n\nk = (-x/y) * [ y(y -24) / (2 x ) ] + y/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (-x/y) * [ y(y -24) / (2 x ) ] + y/2\n\n= [ - (x/y) * y (y -24) ] / (2 x ) + y/2\n\n= [ - (y -24) ] / 2 + y/2\n\n= [ -y +24 + y ] / 2\n\n= 24 / 2\n\n= 12\n\nSo, k = 12.\n\nSo, the circumcenter is at (h, 12), where h = x/2 + [ y(y -24) ] / (2 x )\n\nThus, the circumradius is the distance from (h, 12) to A(0,0):\n\nR^2 = h^2 + 12^2 = (x/2 + [ y(y -24) ] / (2 x ))^2 + 144\n\nGiven that R = 13, so:\n\nh^2 + 144 = 13^2 = 169\n\nThus,\n\nh^2 = 169 - 144 = 25\n\nSo,\n\nh = \u00b15\n\nBut since the rectangle is from x=0 to x=AB, and X is inside, h must be between certain values. Let's see.\n\nh = x/2 + [ y(y -24) ] / (2 x )\n\nBut y is between 0 and24, so y -24 is negative. So, [ y(y -24) ] is negative or zero. So, the second term is negative or zero. So, h can be positive or negative, but since X is inside the rectangle, and h is the x-coordinate of the circumcenter, which for triangle AXD, which has points at (0,0), (x,y), and (0,24), the circumcenter is likely in the middle somewhere. But we found h = \u00b15.\n\nSo, h can be 5 or -5.\n\nBut let's see, in the rectangle, point X is at (x,y), and the circumcenter is at (h,12). Since A is at (0,0), D is at (0,24), X is somewhere inside, so the circumradius is 13.\n\nIf h is positive, then the circumcenter is at (5,12). If h is negative, at (-5,12). But given that all points of the triangle are in the rectangle (x >=0, y between 0 and24), the circumcenter is more likely to be at (5,12) because if h were -5, the distance from (-5,12) to A(0,0) would be sqrt(25 + 144)=13, which is correct, but would the circumradius be 13? Let me check.\n\nWait, the distance from (-5,12) to A(0,0) is indeed 13. To D(0,24) is sqrt(25 + (12)^2 )=sqrt(25 + 144)=13. So, both A and D lie on the circle centered at (-5,12) with radius 13. Similarly, check if X is on this circle.\n\nDistance from (-5,12) to X(x,y) should be 13.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( (x +5)^2 + (y -12)^2 ) =13\n\n=> (x +5)^2 + (y -12)^2 = 169\n\nSimilarly, if h =5, the circumcenter is at (5,12). Then, distance from (5,12) to A(0,0) is sqrt(25 + 144)=13, to D(0,24) is sqrt(25 + (12)^2 )=13, and to X(x,y) would be sqrt( (x -5)^2 + (y -12)^2 )=13.\n\nSo, both possibilities exist, but X is inside the rectangle, so if h is -5, the circumcircle would extend to the left of the rectangle, but X is inside, so perhaps h must be positive 5.\n\nWait, but if h is -5, X would have to be inside the rectangle, but the circumcircle would have points at (-5,12), which is outside the rectangle. However, the triangle AXD is inside the rectangle, so the circumradius must lie such that all points are on the circle. But A and D are on the circle regardless, but X must also be on the circle.\n\nSo, if X is inside the rectangle, and the circumcircle is centered at (-5,12), then the point X would have to lie on that circle, but given that X is between x=0 and x=AB, which is positive, we can see if that's possible.\n\nBut let's consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: h =5.\n\nThen, circumcenter is at (5,12). So, X lies on the circle centered at (5,12) with radius 13.\n\nThus,\n\n(x -5)^2 + (y -12)^2 = 169.\n\nCase 2: h = -5.\n\nCircumcenter at (-5,12). Then,\n\n(x +5)^2 + (y -12)^2 = 169.\n\nBut since X is inside the rectangle, x >=0, so in Case 2, x +5 >=5, so (x +5)^2 >=25. Then, (y -12)^2 <=169 -25=144, so |y -12| <=12, which is true since y is between 0 and24.\n\nBut since X is inside the rectangle, x is between 0 and AB, and y is between 0 and24.\n\nBut I think both cases are possible. However, since triangle AXD is acute, the circumradius lies inside the triangle. If the circumradius were at (-5,12), which is outside the rectangle, but the triangle AXD is inside, so perhaps the circumradius must be at (5,12). Because if the circumradius is inside the triangle, and the triangle is in the rectangle, then the circumradius must be inside the rectangle as well.\n\nTherefore, I think h=5 is the correct one.\n\nSo, (x -5)^2 + (y -12)^2 =169.\n\nSimilarly, from triangle BXC, which has circumradius 15.\n\nLet me perform the same analysis for triangle BXC.\n\nTriangle BXC has points B(AB,0), X(x,y), C(AB,24).\n\nThe circumradius is 15.\n\nFollowing the same steps as above, I can find the circumcenter.\n\nLet me denote the circumcenter as (h', k').\n\nMidpoint of BX: ( (AB +x)/2, y/2 ). Slope of BX: (y -0)/(x - AB ) = y/(x - AB ). So, the perpendicular bisector will have slope (AB -x)/y.\n\nEquation of perpendicular bisector of BX: (y' - y/2 ) = [ (AB -x)/y ] (x' - (AB +x)/2 )\n\nSimilarly, midpoint of XC: ( (AB +x)/2, (y +24)/2 ). Slope of XC: (24 - y)/(AB -x ). So, perpendicular bisector slope is (x - AB )/(24 - y )\n\nEquation of perpendicular bisector of XC: (y' - (y +24)/2 ) = [ (x - AB )/(24 - y ) ] (x' - (AB +x)/2 )\n\nSet these equal to find (h', k').\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, since triangle BXC has a circumradius of 15, and points B(AB,0), X(x,y), C(AB,24), the circumcenter can be found similarly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the same approach as before.\n\nGiven that triangle BXC is acute and has a circumradius of 15, its circumcenter is inside the triangle.\n\nSo, similar to triangle AXD, the circumradius can be found by considering the circumcircle passing through B, X, and C.\n\nLet me find the circumcenter of triangle BXC.\n\nMidpoint of BC: (AB,12). Since BC is vertical, the perpendicular bisector is horizontal, so the perpendicular bisector is the line y =12.\n\nMidpoint of BX: ( (AB +x)/2, y/2 ). The perpendicular bisector of BX can be found as before.\n\nBut maybe instead, since the circumradius is 15, and points B and C are at (AB,0) and (AB,24), the distance from the circumcenter (h',k') to both B and C is 15.\n\nSo,\n\nDistance from (h',k') to B(AB,0): sqrt( (h' - AB)^2 + (k' - 0)^2 ) =15\n\nDistance from (h',k') to C(AB,24): sqrt( (h' - AB)^2 + (k' -24)^2 ) =15\n\nSo,\n\n(h' - AB)^2 + k'^2 =225\n\n(h' - AB)^2 + (k' -24)^2 =225\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n[ (h' - AB)^2 + (k' -24)^2 ] - [ (h' - AB)^2 + k'^2 ] =0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(k' -24)^2 - k'^2 =0\n\nExpand:\n\nk'^2 -48 k' +576 -k'^2=0\n\nSimplify:\n\n-48 k' +576=0 => 48 k' =576 => k'=12\n\nSo, the circumcenter lies on y=12, as expected.\n\nSo, (h' - AB)^2 + (12)^2 =225\n\nThus,\n\n(h' - AB)^2 +144=225 => (h' - AB)^2=81 => h' - AB=\u00b19 => h'= AB \u00b19\n\nSo, the circumcenter is at (AB +9, 12) or (AB -9,12).\n\nBut since the triangle is inside the rectangle, which spans from x=0 to x=AB, the circumcenter is likely at (AB -9, 12). Because if h'=AB +9, it would be outside the rectangle on the right, but the triangle is inside, so the circumradius should be inside as well. Therefore, h' = AB -9.\n\nSo, the circumcenter is at (AB -9,12).\n\nNow, the distance from this circumcenter to point X(x,y) must also be 15.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( (x - (AB -9))^2 + (y -12)^2 ) =15\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(x - AB +9)^2 + (y -12)^2 =225.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) From triangle AXD: (x -5)^2 + (y -12)^2 =169.\n\n2) From triangle BXC: (x - AB +9)^2 + (y -12)^2 =225.\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n[ (x - AB +9)^2 + (y -12)^2 ] - [ (x -5)^2 + (y -12)^2 ] =225 -169=56\n\nSimplify:\n\n(x - AB +9)^2 - (x -5)^2 =56\n\nExpand both squares:\n\n[ x^2 -2 AB x + (AB)^2 +18x -18 AB +81 ] - [x^2 -10x +25 ] =56\n\nCompute term by term:\n\nFirst square:\n\n(x - AB +9)^2 = x^2 - 2 AB x + (AB)^2 + 18 x - 18 AB +81\n\nSecond square:\n\n(x -5)^2 =x^2 -10x +25\n\nSubtracting:\n\n[ x^2 -2 AB x + AB^2 +18 x -18 AB +81 ] - [ x^2 -10x +25 ] = \n\nx^2 -2 AB x + AB^2 +18 x -18 AB +81 -x^2 +10x -25\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2 AB x + AB^2 + (18x +10x) + (-18 AB ) + (81 -25)\n\n= -2 AB x + AB^2 +28x -18 AB +56\n\nSet equal to 56:\n\n-2 AB x + AB^2 +28x -18 AB +56 =56\n\nSubtract 56 from both sides:\n\n-2 AB x + AB^2 +28x -18 AB =0\n\nFactor terms with AB:\n\nAB^2 -2 AB x -18 AB +28x=0\n\nFactor AB:\n\nAB ( AB -2x -18 ) +28x=0\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's factor:\n\nAB^2 - AB(2x +18 ) +28x=0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of AB. Let me write it as:\n\nAB^2 - AB(2x +18 ) +28x=0\n\nLet me denote AB = b for simplicity. Then,\n\nb^2 - b(2x +18 ) +28x=0\n\nQuadratic in b:\n\nb^2 - (2x +18) b +28x=0\n\nWe can solve for b using quadratic formula:\n\nb = [ (2x +18 ) \u00b1 sqrt( (2x +18)^2 -4*1*28x ) ] / 2\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n(2x +18)^2 -112x =4x^2 +72x +324 -112x=4x^2 -40x +324\n\nFactor out 4:\n\n4(x^2 -10x +81)\n\nCheck if x^2 -10x +81 can be factored. Discriminant: 100 - 324= -224 <0. So, it's not factorable, so:\n\nsqrt(4(x^2 -10x +81 ))=2 sqrt(x^2 -10x +81 )\n\nThus,\n\nb = [ (2x +18 ) \u00b1 2 sqrt(x^2 -10x +81 ) ] /2 = (x +9 ) \u00b1 sqrt(x^2 -10x +81 )\n\nSo,\n\nb = (x +9 ) \u00b1 sqrt(x^2 -10x +81 )\n\nBut b is AB, which is a length, so positive.\n\nNow, let's look at sqrt(x^2 -10x +81 ). Let me write it as sqrt( (x -5)^2 +56 ). Since (x -5)^2 +56 is always positive, sqrt is real.\n\nSo, AB can be either (x +9 ) + sqrt(x^2 -10x +81 ) or (x +9 ) - sqrt(x^2 -10x +81 )\n\nBut AB must be greater than x, since AB is the length of the side of the rectangle and x is the x-coordinate of point X inside the rectangle.\n\nLet me compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, AB = (x +9 ) + sqrt(x^2 -10x +81 )\n\nSince sqrt(x^2 -10x +81 ) is positive, this would make AB greater than x +9, which is possible.\n\nSecond, AB = (x +9 ) - sqrt(x^2 -10x +81 )\n\nSince sqrt(x^2 -10x +81 ) = sqrt( (x -5)^2 +56 ) >= sqrt(56 ) \u22487.48, so x +9 - sqrt(...) could be positive or negative depending on x.\n\nBut AB must be positive and greater than x, as x is inside the rectangle.\n\nSo, let's check when AB = (x +9 ) - sqrt(x^2 -10x +81 ) is positive:\n\n(x +9 ) > sqrt(x^2 -10x +81 )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nx^2 +18x +81 > x^2 -10x +81\n\nSimplify:\n\n18x > -10x => 28x >0 => x>0.\n\nWhich is true since X is inside the rectangle, x>0.\n\nSo, both possibilities are positive.\n\nBut we need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use Equation (1): x^2 + y^2 = AB x.\n\nFrom Equation (1): AB = (x^2 + y^2 ) /x.\n\nWe also have from triangle AXD's circumradius condition, equation (1): (x -5)^2 + (y -12)^2 =169.\n\nLet me expand this equation:\n\nx^2 -10x +25 + y^2 -24y +144 =169\n\nSimplify:\n\nx^2 + y^2 -10x -24y +169=169\n\nThus,\n\nx^2 + y^2 -10x -24y =0\n\nFrom Equation (1), x^2 + y^2 = AB x.\n\nSo, substituting into the above:\n\nAB x -10x -24y =0\n\n=> x( AB -10 ) -24 y =0\n\n=> x( AB -10 ) =24 y\n\n=> y = [x ( AB -10 ) ] /24\n\nSo, y is expressed in terms of x and AB.\n\nNow, from Equation (1): AB = (x^2 + y^2 )/x.\n\nSubstitute y = [x ( AB -10 ) ] /24 into this.\n\nCompute y^2:\n\ny^2 = [x^2 ( AB -10 )^2 ] / (24^2 ) = [x^2 ( AB -10 )^2 ] / 576\n\nSo,\n\nAB = (x^2 + [x^2 ( AB -10 )^2 ] /576 ) /x\n\nSimplify:\n\nAB = [x^2 (1 + (AB -10)^2 /576 ) ] /x =x (1 + (AB -10)^2 /576 )\n\nThus,\n\nAB =x + [x (AB -10 )^2 ] /576\n\nMultiply both sides by 576:\n\n576 AB =576 x +x (AB -10 )^2\n\nFactor x:\n\n576 AB =x [576 + (AB -10 )^2 ]\n\nThus,\n\nx = (576 AB ) / [576 + (AB -10 )^2 ]\n\nNow, also from our earlier equation:\n\nAB = (x +9 ) \u00b1 sqrt(x^2 -10x +81 )\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express x in terms of AB and substitute into this equation.\n\nWait, I have x expressed as x = (576 AB ) / [576 + (AB -10 )^2 ]\n\nLet me denote AB as b for simplicity.\n\nSo, x = (576 b ) / [576 + (b -10 )^2 ]\n\nNow, let's substitute x into the equation AB = (x +9 ) \u00b1 sqrt(x^2 -10x +81 )\n\nWhich is:\n\nb = (x +9 ) \u00b1 sqrt(x^2 -10x +81 )\n\nBut x is expressed in terms of b.\n\nThis seems like a complex equation, but maybe we can substitute.\n\nLet me write:\n\nsqrt(x^2 -10x +81 ) = sqrt( (x -5)^2 +56 )\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider substituting x = (576 b ) / D, where D=576 + (b -10 )^2.\n\nThen,\n\nb = [ (576 b / D ) +9 ] \u00b1 sqrt( (576 b / D )^2 -10*(576 b / D ) +81 )\n\nThis is getting too messy. Maybe a better approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the two equations we have:\n\n1) From triangle AXD: (x -5)^2 + (y -12)^2 =169.\n\n2) From triangle BXC: (x - b +9)^2 + (y -12)^2 =225.\n\nWhere b=AB.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(x - b +9)^2 - (x -5)^2 =56.\n\nWhich, as before, simplifies to:\n\n-2 b x + b^2 +28x -18 b =0.\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nb^2 - (2x +18) b +28x=0.\n\nWhich is the quadratic in b.\n\nSo, from Equation (1): AB = (x^2 + y^2 )/x.\n\nAnd from Equation (1) substitution earlier: y = [x ( AB -10 ) ] /24.\n\nSo, y = [x (b -10 ) ] /24.\n\nSo, let me substitute y into equation 1:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (y -12)^2 =169.\n\nWhich is:\n\n(x^2 -10x +25 ) + (y^2 -24 y +144 )=169.\n\nBut from Equation (1):\n\nx^2 + y^2 =b x.\n\nSo, substitute x^2 + y^2 =b x into the equation:\n\n(b x ) -10x -24 y +169=169.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(b x -10x ) -24 y =0.\n\nBut from earlier, y = [x (b -10 ) ] /24.\n\nSo,\n\nx (b -10 ) -24 y =0.\n\nWhich is consistent.\n\nSo, now, let me try to find x and y in terms of b.\n\nFrom y = [x (b -10 ) ] /24.\n\nFrom equation (1): x^2 + y^2 =b x.\n\nSubstitute y:\n\nx^2 + [x^2 (b -10 )^2 ] / (24)^2 =b x.\n\nFactor x^2:\n\nx^2 [1 + (b -10 )^2 /576 ] =b x.\n\nDivide both sides by x (x \u22600):\n\nx [1 + (b -10 )^2 /576 ] =b.\n\nThus,\n\nx= b / [1 + (b -10 )^2 /576 ] = (576 b ) / [576 + (b -10 )^2 ].\n\nWhich matches our earlier expression.\n\nSo, x is expressed in terms of b.\n\nNow, from the equation:\n\nb^2 - (2x +18 ) b +28x=0.\n\nSubstitute x= (576 b ) / [576 + (b -10 )^2 ] into this equation.\n\nSo,\n\nb^2 - [2*(576 b ) / D +18 ] b +28*(576 b ) / D=0,\n\nwhere D=576 + (b -10 )^2.\n\nThis seems very complicated, but perhaps I can multiply through by D to eliminate denominators.\n\nSo,\n\nb^2 D - [2*576 b +18 D ] b +28*576 b =0.\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\nTerm1: b^2 D = b^2 [576 + (b -10 )^2 ]\n\nTerm2: [2*576 b +18 D ] b = [1152 b +18*(576 + (b -10 )^2 ) ] b\n\nTerm3: 28*576 b =16128 b\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nb^2 [576 + (b -10 )^2 ] - [1152 b +18*(576 + (b -10 )^2 ) ] b +16128 b=0\n\nLet me expand each part:\n\nFirst, expand Term1:\n\nb^2 [576 + (b^2 -20b +100 ) ]= b^2 [b^2 -20b +676 ]=b^4 -20 b^3 +676 b^2.\n\nTerm2:\n\n[1152 b +18*(576 + b^2 -20b +100 ) ] b\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n18*(576 +b^2 -20b +100 )=18*676 +18 b^2 -360 b +1800=12168 +18 b^2 -360 b +1800=13968 +18 b^2 -360 b.\n\nSo, the entire bracket is:\n\n1152 b +13968 +18 b^2 -360 b =18 b^2 + (1152 -360 )b +13968=18 b^2 +792 b +13968.\n\nMultiply by b:\n\nTerm2=18 b^3 +792 b^2 +13968 b.\n\nTerm3=16128 b.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTerm1 - Term2 + Term3 =0\n\nThus,\n\n(b^4 -20 b^3 +676 b^2 ) - (18 b^3 +792 b^2 +13968 b ) +16128 b=0\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nb^4 -20b^3 +676b^2 -18b^3 -792b^2 -13968b +16128b=0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nb^4 + (-20b^3 -18b^3 ) + (676b^2 -792b^2 ) + (-13968b +16128b )=0\n\nCompute each:\n\nb^4 -38b^3 -116b^2 +2160b =0\n\nFactor out b:\n\nb (b^3 -38b^2 -116b +2160 )=0\n\nSince b=AB>0, we can ignore the solution b=0.\n\nSo, solve:\n\nb^3 -38b^2 -116b +2160=0.\n\nLet me try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem.

No.\n\nWait, maybe it doesn't factor.\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (b -10)(b^2 -10b -216 )=0.\n\nThus, roots are b=10, and roots of b^2 -10b -216=0.\n\nSolve quadratic:\n\nb=(10 \u00b1sqrt(100 +864 ))/2=(10 \u00b1sqrt(964 ))/2=(10 \u00b1 31 )/2.\n\nSo, roots are (10 +31)/2=41/2=20.5, and (10 -31)/2=-21/2=-10.5.\n\nSo, the roots are b=10, b=20.5, b=-10.5.\n\nSince b=AB>0, possible roots are b=10 and b=20.5.\n\nBut let's check b=10.\n\nFrom earlier equation:\n\nFrom equation y = [x (b -10 ) ] /24.\n\nIf b=10, then y=0.\n\nBut point X is inside the rectangle, so y=0 would put X on side AB, but then angle AXB would be undefined or zero, which contradicts that angle AXB is 90 degrees. So, b=10 is invalid.\n\nThus, the only valid root is b=20.5=41/2.\n\nSo, AB=41/2=20.5.\n\nBut let me verify this.\n\nCompute AB=41/2=20.5.\n\nFrom earlier, x= (576 b ) / [576 + (b -10 )^2 ]\n\nCompute denominator:\n\n576 + (20.5 -10 )^2=576 +10.5^2=576 +110.25=686.25.\n\nSo,\n\nx= (576 *20.5 ) /686.25.\n\nCompute numerator:576*20.5=576*(20 +0.5 )=11520 +288=11808.\n\nSo,\n\nx=11808 /686.25.\n\nCompute this division:\n\n686.25 *17= 686.25*10=6862.5; 686.25*7=4803.75.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to check if b=20.5 is indeed a root.\n\nCompute P(b)=b^3 -38b^2 -116b +2160 at b=20.5.\n\nCompute 20.5^3=20.5*20.5*20.5.\n\nFirst compute 20^3=8000.\n\n0.5^3=0.125.\n\n20.5^3= (20 +0.5)^3=20^3 +3*20^2*0.5 +3*20*(0.5)^2 +0.5^3=8000 +3*400*0.5 +3*20*0.25 +0.125=8000 +600 +15 +0.125=8615.125.\n\nNow, compute 38b^2=38*(20.5)^2.\n\n20.5^2=420.25.\n\n38*420.25=38*400 +38*20.25=15200 +770.25=15970.25.\n\nCompute 116b=116*20.5=2378.\n\nSo,\n\nP(b)=8615.125 -15970.25 -2378 +2160.\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n8615.125 -15970.25= -7355.125.\n\n-7355.125 -2378= -9733.125.\n\n-9733.125 +2160= -7573.125\u22600.\n\nWait, that's not zero.

So, let me check that.\n\nIf h= -5, then circumradius equation is (x +5)^2 + (y -12)^2=169.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC, we have (x - AB +9 )^2 + (y -12 )^2=225.\n\nSo, if h= -5, then:\n\n(x +5)^2 + (y -12)^2=169.\n\nAnd for triangle BXC:\n\n(x - AB +9 )^2 + (y -12 )^2=225.\n\nSubtracting, we get:\n\n(x - AB +9 )^2 - (x +5 )^2=56.\n\nExpand:\n\nx^2 -2 AB x +81 +18x - AB^2 -x^2 -10x -25=56.\n\nWait, no, better to expand each square:\n\n(x - AB +9 )^2 =x^2 -2 AB x + AB^2 +18x -18 AB +81.\n\n(x +5 )^2 =x^2 +10x +25.\n\nSubtract: [x^2 -2 AB x + AB^2 +18x -18 AB +81 ] - [x^2 +10x +25 ]=56.\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2 AB x + AB^2 +8x -18 AB +56=56.\n\nSo,\n\n-2 AB x + AB^2 +8x -18 AB =0.\n\nFactor:\n\nAB^2 - (2x +18 ) AB +8x=0.\n\nAgain, quadratic in AB:\n\nAB^2 - AB(2x +18 ) +8x=0.\n\nWhich is similar to before but with 8x instead of28x.\n\nSo, discriminant:\n\n(2x +18 )^2 -32x=4x^2 +72x +324 -32x=4x^2 +40x +324.\n\nFactor out 4:\n\n4(x^2 +10x +81 ).\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(4(x^2 +10x +81 ))=2 sqrt(x^2 +10x +81 ).\n\nThus,\n\nAB= [ (2x +18 ) \u00b12 sqrt(x^2 +10x +81 ) ] /2= x +9 \u00b1 sqrt(x^2 +10x +81 ).\n\nSo, AB= x +9 \u00b1 sqrt(x^2 +10x +81 ).\n\nBut AB must be greater than x.\n\nSo, both possibilities:\n\nAB= x +9 + sqrt(x^2 +10x +81 )\n\nand\n\nAB= x +9 - sqrt(x^2 +10x +81 )\n\nBut sqrt(x^2 +10x +81 )=sqrt( (x +5 )^2 +56 )>=sqrt(56 )\u22487.48.\n\nSo, AB= x +9 - sqrt(...) must be positive.\n\nx +9 > sqrt(x^2 +10x +81 )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nx^2 +18x +81 >x^2 +10x +81\n\nSimplify:\n\n8x>0 =>x>0, which is true.\n\nSo, both possibilities are positive.\n\nNow, from equation (1):x^2 + y^2 =AB x.\n\nAnd from triangle AXD's circumradius condition, with h=-5, we have:\n\n(x +5)^2 + (y -12 )^2=169.\n\nExpanding:\n\nx^2 +10x +25 +y^2 -24y +144=169.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx^2 + y^2 +10x -24y +169=169.\n\nThus,\n\nx^2 + y^2 +10x -24y=0.\n\nFrom Equation (1):x^2 + y^2 =AB x.\n\nSubstitute:\n\nAB x +10x -24y=0 =>x (AB +10 )=24 y => y= [x (AB +10 ) ] /24.\n\nNow, from Equation (1):x^2 + y^2 =AB x.\n\nSubstitute y:\n\nx^2 + [x^2 (AB +10 )^2 ] / (24^2 )=AB x.\n\nFactor x^2:\n\nx^2 [1 + (AB +10 )^2 /576 ]=AB x.\n\nDivide by x (x\u22600):\n\nx= AB / [1 + (AB +10 )^2 /576 ]= (576 AB ) / [576 + (AB +10 )^2 ].\n\nSo, x= (576 AB ) / [576 + (AB +10 )^2 ].\n\nNow, substitute into the equation AB= x +9 \u00b1 sqrt(x^2 +10x +81 ).\n\nLet me proceed similarly.\n\nLet me denote AB as b.\n\nSo,\n\nx= (576 b ) / [576 + (b +10 )^2 ].\n\nSo,\n\nb= x +9 \u00b1 sqrt(x^2 +10x +81 ).\n\nBut x is expressed in terms of b.\n\nThis seems complex, but let me substitute x.\n\nSo,\n\nb= [ (576 b ) / D ] +9 \u00b1 sqrt( [ (576 b ) / D ]^2 +10*(576 b ) / D +81 ),\n\nwhere D=576 + (b +10 )^2.\n\nThis is complicated, but perhaps I can square both sides after rearrangement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that sqrt(x^2 +10x +81 )=sqrt( (x +5 )^2 +56 ).\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the equation as:\n\nb -x -9=\u00b1sqrt(x^2 +10x +81 ).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(b -x -9 )^2 =x^2 +10x +81.\n\nExpand left side:\n\nb^2 -2b x -18b +x^2 +18x +81 =x^2 +10x +81.\n\nSimplify:\n\nb^2 -2b x -18b +18x=10x.\n\nSo,\n\nb^2 -2b x -18b +8x=0.\n\nFactor:\n\nb^2 -2x b -18b +8x=0.\n\nFactor b:\n\nb (b -2x -18 ) +8x=0.\n\nThis seems similar to earlier.\n\nBut, from equation (1):\n\nx^2 + y^2 =b x.\n\nAnd from y= [x (b +10 ) ] /24.\n\nSo,\n\nx^2 + [x^2 (b +10 )^2 ] /576 =b x.\n\nFactor x^2:\n\nx^2 [1 + (b +10 )^2 /576 ]=b x.\n\nDivide by x:\n\nx [1 + (b +10 )^2 /576 ]=b.\n\nThus,\n\nx= b / [1 + (b +10 )^2 /576 ]= (576 b ) / [576 + (b +10 )^2 ].\n\nSo, x=576 b / D, where D=576 + (b +10 )^2.\n\nNow, substitute into equation:\n\nb^2 -2b x -18b +8x=0.\n\nSo,\n\nb^2 -2b*(576 b / D ) -18b +8*(576 b / D )=0.\n\nMultiply through by D:\n\nb^2 D -2*576 b^2 -18b D +8*576 b=0.\n\nSubstitute D=576 + (b +10 )^2.\n\nSo,\n\nb^2 [576 + (b +10 )^2 ] -2*576 b^2 -18b [576 + (b +10 )^2 ] +8*576 b=0.\n\nExpand each term:\n\nTerm1: b^2 [576 + b^2 +20b +100 ]=b^4 +20b^3 +676b^2.\n\nTerm2: -2*576 b^2= -1152 b^2.\n\nTerm3: -18b [576 + b^2 +20b +100 ]= -18b*576 -18b^3 -360b^2 -1800b= -10368b -18b^3 -360b^2 -1800b.\n\nTerm4:8*576 b=4608b.\n\nSo, putting all together:\n\nTerm1 + Term2 + Term3 + Term4=0.\n\nSo,\n\n(b^4 +20b^3 +676b^2 ) + (-1152b^2 ) + (-10368b -18b^3 -360b^2 -1800b ) +4608b=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nb^4 + (20b^3 -18b^3 ) + (676b^2 -1152b^2 -360b^2 ) + (-10368b -1800b +4608b )=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\nb^4 +2b^3 + (-836b^2 ) + (-17160b )=0.\n\nFactor:\n\nb (b^3 +2b^2 -836b -17160 )=0.\n\nSince b>0, ignore b=0.\n\nSo, solve:\n\nb^3 +2b^2 -836b -17160=0.\n\nAgain, try rational roots.

But perhaps another property.\n\nWait, in an acute triangle, the circumradius R satisfies R > a/2 for any side a.\n\nIn triangle AXD, sides are sqrt(x^2 + y^2 ), sqrt(x^2 + (24 - y )^2 ), and 24.\n\nSo, the maximum side is 24, so R >=24/2=12. Given R=13>12, which holds.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC, sides are sqrt( (AB -x )^2 + y^2 ), sqrt( (AB -x )^2 + (24 - y )^2 ), and 24.\n\nSo, again, R >=12, and R=15>12, which holds.\n\nBut perhaps another property.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that in triangle AXD, since it's acute, the circumradius can be found using the formula R = \\frac{a b c}{4 \\Delta }, but I don't see how that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for an acute triangle, the circumradius lies inside the triangle.\n\nWait, but I think I'm stuck here. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should consider that AB=20.5=41/2, which is 20.5.\n\nBut earlier, when I checked, the equation didn't satisfy, but maybe I made a calculation mistake.\n\nWait, let's check AB=41/2=20.5.\n\nFrom earlier, x\u224817.2066, y\u22487.5279.\n\nCheck equation for triangle BXC:\n\n(x - AB +9 )^2 + (y -12 )^2\u2248(17.2066 -20.5 +9 )^2 + (7.5279 -12 )^2\u2248(5.7066 )^2 + (-4.4721 )^2\u224832.56 +20\u224852.56.\n\nBut it should be 225. So, discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps a miscalculation in x and y.\n\nWait, AB=20.5.\n\nFrom y= [x (b -10 ) ] /24.\n\nSo, y= [x *10.5 ] /24.\n\nFrom x= (576 b ) / [576 + (b -10 )^2 ]= (576 *20.5 ) / [576 +10.5^2 ]=11808 / (576 +110.25 )=11808 /686.25\u224817.2066.\n\nSo, y= (17.2066 *10.5 ) /24\u2248180.6693 /24\u22487.5279.\n\nThen, in triangle BXC:\n\n(x - AB +9 )^2 + (y -12 )^2= (17.2066 -20.5 +9 )^2 + (7.5279 -12 )^2\u2248(5.7066 )^2 + (-4.4721 )^2\u224832.56 +20\u224852.56.\n\nBut it should be 225.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It says:\n\nLet ABCD be a rectangle with BC = 24. Point X lies inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. Given that triangles AX D and BXC are both acute and have circumradii 13 and 15, respectively, compute AB.\n\nHmm, okay, let's try to visualize this. ABCD is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Let me label the rectangle: let's say A is at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, AB and CD are the bases, and BC and AD are the heights.\n\nGiven that BC = 24, so that means AD is also 24 because it's a rectangle. We need to find AB, which is the other side of the rectangle.\n\nPoint X is inside the rectangle, and angle AXB is 90 degrees. That means if we connect points A, X, and B, we'll form a right-angled triangle at X.\n\nAdditionally, triangles AX D and BXC are both acute and have circumradii 13 and 15, respectively.\n\nAlright, so first, since angle AXB is 90 degrees, triangle AXB is right-angled at X. That means by the converse of Thales' theorem, point X lies on the circle with diameter AB. But wait, in a rectangle, the circle with diameter AB would have its center at the midpoint of AB, and radius AB/2. But in this case, point X is inside the rectangle, so it's somewhere on that circle.\n\nBut let's think about triangles AX D and BXC. Both are acute, which means all their angles are less than 90 degrees. Also, they each have a circumradius given: 13 for triangle AX D and 15 for triangle BXC.\n\nI remember that for any triangle, the circumradius R can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR = (a * b * c) / (4 * area)\n\nWhere a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.\n\nBut since both triangles AX D and BXC are acute, their circumcenters must lie inside the triangles.\n\nWait, also, for a right-angled triangle, the circumradius is half the hypotenuse. But these triangles are acute, so that formula doesn't apply directly. Hmm.\n\nLet me sketch the rectangle ABCD with AB as the base. Let me assign coordinates to the points to make it easier. Let's place point A at (0, 0), so point B would be at (x, 0), point C at (x, 24), and point D at (0, 24), where x is the length AB that we need to find.\n\nPoint X is somewhere inside the rectangle, with coordinates (a, b), where 0 < a < x and 0 < b < 24.\n\nGiven that angle AXB is 90 degrees, the vectors XA and XB are perpendicular. So, the dot product of vectors XA and XB should be zero.\n\nVector XA is from X to A: (0 - a, 0 - b) = (-a, -b)\nVector XB is from X to B: (x - a, 0 - b) = (x - a, -b)\n\nDot product: (-a)(x - a) + (-b)(-b) = 0\nWhich simplifies to: -a(x - a) + b\u00b2 = 0\nSo, -a x + a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 0\nWhich can be rearranged as: a\u00b2 - a x + b\u00b2 = 0\n\nThat's equation (1): a\u00b2 - a x + b\u00b2 = 0.\n\nNow, let's look at triangle AX D. Points A, X, D.\n\nPoint A is (0,0), X is (a,b), D is (0,24).\n\nSo, the sides of triangle AX D are:\n\nAX: distance from A to X = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)\nXD: distance from X to D = sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2)\nAD: distance from A to D = 24\n\nSimilarly, triangle BXC has points B, X, C.\n\nPoint B is (x,0), X is (a,b), C is (x,24).\n\nSides of triangle BXC:\n\nBX: distance from B to X = sqrt( (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 )\nXC: distance from X to C = sqrt( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 )\nBC: distance from B to C = 24\n\nGiven that the circumradius of triangle AX D is 13, and that of triangle BXC is 15.\n\nSo, for triangle AX D, using the formula R = (a * b * c) / (4 * area), but maybe it's easier to use the formula R = a / (2 * sin A), but since we don't know the angles, perhaps another approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, since triangle AX D is acute, its circumradius can also be found using the formula involving coordinates.\n\nWait, maybe we can use coordinates to find the circumradius. The circumradius of a triangle can also be found using the formula:\n\nR = \\frac{abc}{4\u0394}\n\nwhere \u0394 is the area of the triangle.\n\nBut for triangle AX D, the sides are:\n\nAX = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)\nXD = sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2)\nAD = 24\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC, the sides are:\n\nBX = sqrt( (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 )\nXC = sqrt( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 )\nBC = 24\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe it's better to find the circumradius using coordinate geometry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the property that in a right-angled triangle, the circumradius is half the hypotenuse, but since triangles AX D and BXC are acute, they are not right-angled, so that property doesn't hold.\n\nWait, but angle AXB is 90 degrees, so triangle AXB is right-angled. But triangle AX D and BXC are different triangles.\n\nWait, perhaps we can use coordinate geometry to find the circumradius.\n\nLet me think: the circumradius of a triangle can be found by finding the circumcircle equation.\n\nFor triangle AX D, points A(0,0), X(a,b), D(0,24).\n\nLet's find the circumradius of triangle AX D.\n\nThe circumradius can be found using the formula:\n\nR = \\frac{ |AB \\times AC| }{ 4\u0394 }\n\nWait, maybe another way. Let's consider the circumcircle of triangle AX D.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0.\n\nSince point A(0,0) is on the circle, substituting gives 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 => F = 0.\n\nSo the equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey = 0.\n\nPoint D(0,24) is on the circle:\n\n0 + 24\u00b2 + 0 + E*24 = 0 => 576 + 24 E = 0 => 24 E = -576 => E = -24.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx -24 y = 0.\n\nNow, point X(a,b) is on this circle:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + D a -24 b = 0.\n\nFrom equation (1), we have a\u00b2 - a x + b\u00b2 = 0. So, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x.\n\nSubstituting into the circle equation:\n\na x + D a -24 b = 0 => a (x + D) -24 b = 0.\n\nSo, equation (2): a(x + D) -24 b = 0.\n\nWe can write this as D = (24 b - a x)/a, provided a \u2260 0.\n\nBut let's see if we can find D. Since the circle passes through A, X, D.\n\nAlternatively, we can find the circumradius R of triangle AX D.\n\nThe formula for the circumradius R is given by:\n\nR = \\frac{ \\sqrt{ (AB^2 + AC^2 - BC^2)^2 } }{ 4 * area }\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to compute the circumradius using the coordinates.\n\nThe circumradius can be calculated as:\n\nR = \\frac{abc}{4\u0394}\n\nWhere a, b, c are the sides, and \u0394 is the area.\n\nFor triangle AX D, sides are AX, XD, AD.\n\nAX = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)\nXD = sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2)\nAD = 24\n\nArea of triangle AX D can be found using the coordinates.\n\nUsing the shoelace formula for area:\n\n\u0394 = (1/2)| (0*(b) - 0*a) + (a*(24) - b*0) + (0*0 - 24*a) | \nWait, that might not be the right approach. Let me think.\n\nSince points A, X, D are at (0,0), (a,b), (0,24), the area can be calculated as the area of a triangle with base AD and height from X to AD.\n\nSince AD is vertical from (0,0) to (0,24), the base is 24. The height is the horizontal distance from X to AD, which is just 'a', since AD is at x=0.\n\nSo area \u0394 = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 24 * a = 12 a.\n\nSo the area of triangle AX D is 12 a.\n\nThen, the circumradius R for triangle AX D is 13, so:\n\n13 = (AX * XD * AD) / (4 * \u0394)\n13 = (sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) * sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2) * 24) / (4 * 12 a)\n\nSimplify denominator: 4 * 12 a = 48 a\n\nSo:\n\n13 = (sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) * sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2) * 24) / (48 a)\nSimplify numerator and denominator: 24 / 48 = 1/2\n\nSo,\n\n13 = (sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) * sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2)) / (2 a)\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n13\u00b2 = [ (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2) ] / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\n169 = [ (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2) ] / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 a\u00b2:\n\n4 * 169 * a\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2)\n\nCompute 4*169: 4*169 = 676\n\nSo,\n\n676 a\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2)\n\nHmm, that looks complicated. Maybe we can find a relationship between a and b from equation (1).\n\nFrom equation (1): a\u00b2 - a x + b\u00b2 = 0 => a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x.\n\nSo, (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = a x.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute (a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2):\n\nThat's a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 576 - 48 b + b\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) + 576 - 48 b = a x + 576 - 48 b.\n\nSo, the product becomes:\n\n(a x)(a x + 576 - 48 b) = a\u00b2 x\u00b2 + a x (576 - 48 b)\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\n676 a\u00b2 = a\u00b2 x\u00b2 + a x (576 - 48 b)\n\nLet me factor out a\u00b2 on the left and a x on the right:\n\n676 a\u00b2 = a\u00b2 x\u00b2 + a x (576 - 48 b)\n\nDivide both sides by a (assuming a \u2260 0, which it isn't because X is inside the rectangle, so a > 0):\n\n676 a = a x\u00b2 + x (576 - 48 b)\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n676 a - a x\u00b2 - x (576 - 48 b) = 0\n\nFactor terms with a:\n\na (676 - x\u00b2) - x (576 - 48 b) = 0\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe express b in terms of a and x from equation (1).\n\nFrom equation (1): a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x => b\u00b2 = a x - a\u00b2 => b\u00b2 = a(x - a)\n\nSo, b = sqrt(a(x - a)).\n\nBut maybe instead of that, let's also consider triangle BXC.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC, which has points B(x,0), X(a,b), C(x,24).\n\nThe sides are:\n\nBX = sqrt( (x - a)^2 + b^2 )\nXC = sqrt( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 )\nBC = 24\n\nSimilarly, the area of triangle BXC can be calculated. Since BC is vertical from (x,0) to (x,24), the base is 24, and the height is the horizontal distance from X to BC, which is |x - a|.\n\nSo, area \u0394' = (1/2) * 24 * |x - a| = 12 |x - a|\n\nGiven that the triangle is acute, so the circumradius R' is 15.\n\nSo,\n\n15 = (BX * XC * BC) / (4 * \u0394')\n\nSo,\n\n15 = (sqrt( (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ) * 24 ) / (4 * 12 |x - a| )\n\nSimplify denominator: 4*12 |x - a| = 48 |x - a|\n\nSo,\n\n15 = [ sqrt( (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ) *24 ] / (48 |x - a| )\n\nSimplify 24/48 to 1/2:\n\n15 = [ sqrt( (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ) ] / (2 |x - a| )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n225 = [ ( (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 ) * ( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ) ] / (4 (x - a)^2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 (x - a)^2:\n\n900 (x - a)^2 = ( (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 ) ( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 )\n\nLet me denote c = x - a. So, c = x - a, which is positive because a < x (since X is inside the rectangle, so a must be less than x).\n\nSo, c = x - a > 0.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n900 c\u00b2 = (c\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(c\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 )\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n= c\u00b2(c\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 + b\u00b2) + b\u00b2(24 - b)^2\nWait, no, better to multiply it out directly.\n\n(c\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(c\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 ) = c^4 + c\u00b2 (24 - b)^2 + c\u00b2 b\u00b2 + b\u00b2 (24 - b)^2\n\n= c^4 + c\u00b2 [ (24 - b)^2 + b\u00b2 ] + b\u00b2 (24 - b)^2\n\nHmm, let's compute (24 - b)^2 + b\u00b2:\n\n(24 - b)^2 + b\u00b2 = 576 - 48 b + b\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 576 - 48 b + 2 b\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n= c^4 + c\u00b2 (576 - 48 b + 2 b\u00b2 ) + b\u00b2 (576 - 48 b + b\u00b2 )\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe we can find another relationship.\n\nWait, from equation (1): a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x\n\nSo, from this, we can write a x = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, in the earlier equation for triangle AX D, we had:\n\n676 a\u00b2 = (a x)(a x + 576 - 48 b )\n\nWhich, substituting a x = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2, becomes:\n\n676 a\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 576 - 48 b )\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC, we have:\n\n900 c\u00b2 = (c\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(c\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 )\n\nBut c = x - a.\n\nSince x is AB, which is the length we need to find.\n\nWait, perhaps we can find a relationship between a and b from equation (1):\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x => x = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/a\n\nSo, x = a + (b\u00b2)/a\n\nThat might be useful.\n\nWait, let's let me denote x = a + k, where k = (b\u00b2)/a.\n\nSo, x = a + k.\n\nThen, c = x - a = k\n\nSo, c = k = b\u00b2 / a\n\nSo, c = b\u00b2 / a\n\nTherefore, we can express everything in terms of a and b.\n\nSo, from triangle AX D, equation:\n\n676 a\u00b2 = (a x)(a x + 576 - 48 b )\n\nSubstituting x = a + k, where k = b\u00b2 / a.\n\nSo, a x = a(a + k) = a\u00b2 + a k = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\nWhich matches equation (1).\n\nSo, a x = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\nThen, a x + 576 - 48 b = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 576 - 48 b\n\nSo, equation (from triangle AX D):\n\n676 a\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 576 - 48 b )\n\nBut a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x, so:\n\n676 a\u00b2 = (a x)(a x + 576 - 48 b )\n\nBut this is the same as before.\n\nWait, but in triangle AX D, we have:\n\n676 a\u00b2 = (a x)(a x + 576 - 48 b )\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BXC, we have:\n\n900 c\u00b2 = (c\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(c\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 )\n\nBut c = k = b\u00b2 / a\n\nSo, let's substitute c = b\u00b2 / a into the equation:\n\n900 (b\u00b2 / a )\u00b2 = ( (b\u00b2 / a )\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) ( (b\u00b2 / a )\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 )\n\nHmm, that seems messy, but maybe we can do it.\n\nCompute left side:\n\n900 (b^4 / a\u00b2 )\n\nRight side:\n\nFirst term: (b^4 / a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) = b\u00b2 (b\u00b2 / a\u00b2 + 1 ) = b\u00b2 ( (b\u00b2 + a\u00b2 ) / a\u00b2 )\n\nSecond term: (b^4 / a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 ) = (b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b)^2 ) / a\u00b2\n\nSo, multiply the two terms:\n\n[ b\u00b2 ( (b\u00b2 + a\u00b2 ) / a\u00b2 ) ] * [ (b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b)^2 ) / a\u00b2 ]\n\n= b\u00b2 (b\u00b2 + a\u00b2 ) (b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b)^2 ) / a^4\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n900 (b^4 / a\u00b2 ) = [ b\u00b2 (b\u00b2 + a\u00b2 ) (b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b)^2 ) ] / a^4\n\nMultiply both sides by a^4:\n\n900 b^4 a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 (b\u00b2 + a\u00b2 ) (b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b)^2 )\n\nDivide both sides by b\u00b2 (assuming b \u2260 0, which it isn't since X is inside the rectangle):\n\n900 b\u00b2 a\u00b2 = (b\u00b2 + a\u00b2 ) (b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b)^2 )\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but let's see.\n\nWe know from equation (1) that a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x.\n\nSo, maybe we can substitute that in.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe we can find another relationship.\n\nWait, in triangle AX D, we have a x = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.\n\nAnd in triangle BXC, we have c = b\u00b2 / a.\n\nSo, we can write x = a + c = a + b\u00b2 / a.\n\nSo, x = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/a, which matches equation (1).\n\nSo, perhaps we can write all equations in terms of a and b.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the two equations we have.\n\nFrom triangle AX D:\n\n676 a\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 576 - 48 b )\n\nFrom triangle BXC:\n\n900 (b\u00b2 / a )\u00b2 = ( (b^4 / a\u00b2 ) + b\u00b2 ) ( (b^4 / a\u00b2 ) + (24 - b )\u00b2 )\n\nHmm, perhaps we can let\u2019s consider the first equation.\n\nLet me denote S = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x.\n\nSo, equation (from AX D):\n\n676 a\u00b2 = S (S + 576 - 48 b )\n\nBut S = a x, so:\n\n676 a\u00b2 = a x (a x + 576 - 48 b )\n\nBut since S = a x, we can write:\n\n676 a\u00b2 = S (S + 576 - 48 b )\n\nBut S = a x, so 676 a\u00b2 = S^2 + (576 - 48 b ) S\n\nSo, equation: S\u00b2 + (576 - 48 b ) S - 676 a\u00b2 = 0\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC, we have:\n\n900 (b^4 / a\u00b2 ) = ( (b^4 / a\u00b2 ) + b\u00b2 ) ( (b^4 / a\u00b2 ) + (24 - b )\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst, (b^4 / a\u00b2 ) + b\u00b2 = b\u00b2 (b\u00b2 / a\u00b2 + 1 ) = b\u00b2 ( (b\u00b2 + a\u00b2 ) / a\u00b2 ) = b\u00b2 S / a\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, (b^4 / a\u00b2 ) + (24 - b )\u00b2 = (b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b )\u00b2 ) / a\u00b2\n\nSo, the right side is:\n\n[ b\u00b2 S / a\u00b2 ] * [ (b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b )\u00b2 ) / a\u00b2 ] = [ b\u00b2 S (b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b )\u00b2 ) ] / a^4\n\nSo, equation:\n\n900 (b^4 / a\u00b2 ) = [ b\u00b2 S (b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b )\u00b2 ) ] / a^4\n\nMultiply both sides by a^4:\n\n900 b^4 a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 S (b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b )\u00b2 )\n\nDivide both sides by b\u00b2:\n\n900 b\u00b2 a\u00b2 = S (b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b )\u00b2 )\n\nHmm, still complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps we can express S in terms of a x.\n\nBut S = a x = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.\n\nSo, let's rewrite this equation:\n\n900 b\u00b2 a\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) (b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b )\u00b2 )\n\nLet me expand the right side:\n\n= (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b )\u00b2 )\n\n= a\u00b2 b^4 + a^4 (24 - b )\u00b2 + b^6 + a\u00b2 b\u00b2 (24 - b )\u00b2\n\nHmm, that seems messy, but maybe we can factor it.\n\nLet me factor terms:\n\n= a\u00b2 [ b^4 + (24 - b )\u00b2 (b\u00b2 + a\u00b2 ) ] + b^6\n\nWait, not sure. Maybe we can write (24 - b )\u00b2 = 576 - 48 b + b\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n= a\u00b2 [ b^4 + (576 - 48 b + b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + a\u00b2 ) ] + b^6\n\nHmm, let's expand (576 - 48 b + b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + a\u00b2 ):\n\n= 576 (b\u00b2 + a\u00b2 ) -48 b (b\u00b2 + a\u00b2 ) + b\u00b2 (b\u00b2 + a\u00b2 )\n\n= 576 b\u00b2 + 576 a\u00b2 -48 b^3 -48 a\u00b2 b + b^4 + a\u00b2 b\u00b2\n\nSo, putting it back:\n\n= a\u00b2 [ b^4 + 576 b\u00b2 + 576 a\u00b2 -48 b^3 -48 a\u00b2 b + b^4 + a\u00b2 b\u00b2 ] + b^6\n\n= a\u00b2 [ 2 b^4 + 576 b\u00b2 + 576 a\u00b2 -48 b^3 -48 a\u00b2 b + a\u00b2 b\u00b2 ] + b^6\n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe we need another approach.\n\nWait, let's think about the first equation again:\n\nFrom triangle AX D:\n\n676 a\u00b2 = S (S + 576 - 48 b )\n\nWhere S = a x = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n676 a\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 576 - 48 b )\n\nWe can write it as:\n\n676 a\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) + 576 - 48 b )\n\nWhich is:\n\n676 a\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)^2 + (576 - 48 b)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 )\n\nLet me let T = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2, so:\n\n676 a\u00b2 = T\u00b2 + (576 - 48 b) T\n\nBut T = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2, which is also equal to a x.\n\nBut from equation (1): T = a x, so x = T / a.\n\nWait, so x = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/a.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can substitute x into another equation.\n\nWait, perhaps also, from triangle BXC, we can find another equation in terms of a and b.\n\nBut it's getting too tangled.

Maybe we can factor it somehow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that both triangles AX D and BXC have their own circumradius equations, so maybe we can find a ratio or something.\n\nWait, let's think about triangle AX D: R =13, triangle BXC: R=15.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps we can express the areas differently.\n\nFor triangle AX D, the area was 12 a, and R =13.\n\nSo, 13 = (AX * XD * AD) / (4 * 12 a )\n\nWhich gave us 13 = (AX * XD)/ (2 a )\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC, area is 12 (x - a ), R=15.\n\nSo, 15 = (BX * XC ) / (2 (x - a ) )\n\nSo, that gives us:\n\nAX * XD = 26 a\n\nBX * XC = 30 (x - a )\n\nSo, AX * XD = 26 a\n\nSimilarly, BX * XC = 30 (x - a )\n\nSo, perhaps if we can compute AX * XD and BX * XC in another way, perhaps in terms of a and b.\n\nCompute AX * XD:\n\nAX = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 )\n\nXD = sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 - b )^2 )\n\nAX * XD = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (24 - b )^2 ) )\n\nSimilarly, from equation (from triangle AX D): AX * XD = 26 a\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (24 - b )^2 ) ) = 26 a\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (24 - b )^2 ) = 676 a\u00b2\n\nWhich is the same as the equation we had earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC:\n\nBX = sqrt( (x - a )^2 + b\u00b2 )\n\nXC = sqrt( (x - a )^2 + (24 - b )^2 )\n\nBX * XC = sqrt( (x -a )^2 + b\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (x - a )^2 + (24 - b )^2 )\n\nFrom equation, this is equal to 30 (x - a )\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( (x - a )^2 + b\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (x - a )^2 + (24 - b )^2 ) = 30 (x - a )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n[ (x -a )^2 + b\u00b2 ][ (x -a )^2 + (24 - b )^2 ] = 900 (x -a )^2\n\nWhich is the same as the other equation we had.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (24 - b )^2 ) = 676 a\u00b2\n\n2) ( (x - a )^2 + b\u00b2 )( (x - a )^2 + (24 - b )^2 ) = 900 (x - a )^2\n\nBut x = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) / a, from equation (1).\n\nSo, let me substitute x = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) / a into equation (2).\n\nSo, x - a = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) / a - a = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - a\u00b2 ) / a = b\u00b2 / a\n\nSo, (x - a ) = b\u00b2 / a\n\nSo, let me denote c = x - a = b\u00b2 / a\n\nSo, equation (2) becomes:\n\n( c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 )( c\u00b2 + (24 - b )^2 ) = 900 c\u00b2\n\nBut c = b\u00b2 / a\n\nSo,\n\n( (b^4 / a\u00b2 ) + b\u00b2 ) ( (b^4 / a\u00b2 ) + (24 - b )^2 ) = 900 (b^4 / a\u00b2 )\n\nHmm, let's compute each term.\n\nFirst term: (b^4 / a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) = b\u00b2 (b\u00b2 / a\u00b2 + 1 ) = b\u00b2 ( (b\u00b2 + a\u00b2 ) / a\u00b2 ) = b\u00b2 ( (a x ) / a\u00b2 ) = b\u00b2 (x / a )\n\nBecause S = a x = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.\n\nSo, x = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) / a.\n\nSo, x / a = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) / a\u00b2.\n\nSo, first term becomes: b\u00b2 (x / a ) = b\u00b2 ( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) / a\u00b2 )\n\nSecond term: (b^4 / a\u00b2 + (24 - b )^2 ) = (b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b )^2 ) / a\u00b2\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n[ b\u00b2 ( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) / a\u00b2 ) ] * [ (b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b )^2 ) / a\u00b2 ] = 900 (b^4 / a\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n= [ b\u00b2 (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) (b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b )^2 ) ] / a^4\n\nSo,\n\n[ b\u00b2 (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) (b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b )^2 ) ] / a^4 = 900 (b^4 / a\u00b2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by a^4:\n\nb\u00b2 (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) (b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b )^2 ) = 900 b^4 a\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by b\u00b2 (assuming b \u2260 0):\n\n(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) (b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b )^2 ) = 900 b\u00b2 a\u00b2\n\nBut from equation (1), (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) = a x = a*(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/a = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2. So, it's the same as S.\n\nWait, but this seems similar to the equation we had earlier for triangle AX D, but different constants.\n\nWait, maybe if we can find a ratio between the two equations.\n\nWait, the first equation is:\n\n(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (24 - b )^2 ) = 676 a\u00b2\n\nAnd the second equation is:\n\n(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b )^2 ) = 900 a\u00b2 b\u00b2\n\nLet me denote equation (1): (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (24 - b )^2 ) = 676 a\u00b2\n\nEquation (2): (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b )^2 ) = 900 a\u00b2 b\u00b2\n\nLet me divide equation (2) by equation (1):\n\n[ (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b )^2 ) ] / [ (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (24 - b )^2 ) ] = (900 a\u00b2 b\u00b2 ) / (676 a\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n[ b^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b )^2 ] / [ a\u00b2 + (24 - b )^2 ] = (900 b\u00b2 ) / 676\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me factor numerator:\n\nb^4 + a\u00b2 (24 - b )^2 = (b^2)^2 + (a (24 - b ))^2\n\nHmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express numerator as:\n\n= (24 - b )^2 a\u00b2 + b^4\n\n= a\u00b2 (24 - b )^2 + b^4\n\nDenominator is a\u00b2 + (24 - b )^2\n\nSo,\n\n[ a\u00b2 (24 - b )^2 + b^4 ] / [ a\u00b2 + (24 - b )^2 ] = (900 b\u00b2 ) / 676\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n[ a\u00b2 (24 - b )^2 + b^4 ] = [ (900 b\u00b2 ) / 676 ] [ a\u00b2 + (24 - b )^2 ]\n\nLet me compute (900 / 676 ) = (225 / 169 )\n\nSo,\n\n[ a\u00b2 (24 - b )^2 + b^4 ] = (225 / 169 ) [ a\u00b2 + (24 - b )^2 ]\n\nMultiply both sides by 169:\n\n169 [ a\u00b2 (24 - b )^2 + b^4 ] = 225 [ a\u00b2 + (24 - b )^2 ]\n\nBring everything to left side:\n\n169 a\u00b2 (24 - b )^2 + 169 b^4 - 225 a\u00b2 - 225 (24 - b )^2 = 0\n\nFactor terms:\n\n= a\u00b2 [ 169 (24 - b )^2 - 225 ] + [ 169 b^4 - 225 (24 - b )^2 ] = 0\n\nLet me compute each bracket separately.\n\nFirst bracket: 169 (24 - b )^2 - 225\n\nSecond bracket: 169 b^4 - 225 (24 - b )^2\n\nFirst bracket:\n\n169 (24 - b )^2 -225 = [13^2] (24 - b )^2 - 15^2\n\n= (13(24 - b ) - 15)(13(24 - b ) + 15 )\n\nWait, because a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b )\n\nSo, 169 (24 - b )^2 - 225 = (13(24 - b ) - 15)(13(24 - b ) +15 )\n\nCompute:\n\n13(24 - b ) -15 = 312 -13 b -15 = 297 -13 b\n\n13(24 - b ) +15 = 312 -13 b +15 = 327 -13 b\n\nSo, first bracket is (297 -13 b)(327 -13 b )\n\nSimilarly, second bracket:\n\n169 b^4 - 225 (24 - b )^2 = [13^2 b^4 ] - [15^2 (24 - b )^2 ]\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n(13 b^2 -15 (24 - b ))(13 b^2 +15 (24 - b ) )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n13 b^2 -15 (24 - b ) =13 b^2 -360 +15 b =13 b^2 +15 b -360\n\n13 b^2 +15 (24 - b ) =13 b^2 +360 -15 b =13 b^2 -15 b +360\n\nSo, second bracket is (13 b^2 +15 b -360)(13 b^2 -15 b +360 )\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\na\u00b2 (297 -13 b )(327 -13 b ) + (13 b^2 +15 b -360)(13 b^2 -15 b +360 ) = 0\n\nHmm, this is a complicated equation, but perhaps it can be factored or simplified further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a substitution.\n\nLet me set t = 13 b.\n\nThen, 13 b = t.\n\nSo, let's substitute:\n\nFirst, 297 -13 b =297 - t\n\n327 -13 b =327 - t\n\n13 b^2 = (t^2 ) / 13\n\n15 b = (15 /13 ) t\n\nSo, 13 b^2 +15 b -360 = (t^2 ) /13 + (15 t ) /13 -360\n\nSimilarly, 13 b^2 -15 b +360 = (t^2 ) /13 - (15 t ) /13 +360\n\nBut this might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set u = b.\n\nBut perhaps instead, notice that the equation is:\n\na\u00b2 (297 -13 b )(327 -13 b ) + (13 b^2 +15 b -360)(13 b^2 -15 b +360 ) = 0\n\nLet me compute each product.\n\nFirst product: (297 -13 b )(327 -13 b )\n\n= 297*327 -297*13 b -327*13 b + (13 b )^2\n\nCompute constants:\n\n297 * 327: Let's compute 300*327=98100, minus 3*327=981, so 98100 -981= 97119.\n\nThen,\n\n= 97119 - (297 + 327)*13 b + 169 b\u00b2\n\n= 97119 - 624*13 b + 169 b\u00b2\n\n624*13: 600*13=7800, 24*13=312, total=8112.\n\nSo,\n\n= 97119 - 8112 b + 169 b\u00b2\n\nSecond product: (13 b^2 +15 b -360)(13 b^2 -15 b +360 )\n\nMultiply them:\n\n= (13 b^2 )^2 - (15 b )^2 + (13 b^2 )( -360 +360 ) + ...

Maybe this isn't helping.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of dealing with a and b, we can set t = b /a.\n\nLet me set t = b /a, so b =a t.\n\nThen, since a \u22600, we can express everything in terms of t.\n\nSo, x = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) /a = (a\u00b2 + a\u00b2 t\u00b2 ) /a =a (1 + t\u00b2 )\n\nSo, x =a (1 + t\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, c =x -a =a (1 + t\u00b2 ) -a =a t\u00b2\n\nSo, c =a t\u00b2\n\nSo, in equation (1):\n\nFrom triangle AX D, (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 )(a\u00b2 + (24 - b )\u00b2 ) =676 a\u00b2\n\nSubstitute b =a t:\n\n(a\u00b2 +a\u00b2 t\u00b2 )(a\u00b2 + (24 - a t )\u00b2 ) =676

=676\n\nBut x =a (1 + t\u00b2 ), so a =x / (1 + t\u00b2 )\n\nSo, let me express a in terms of x and t.\n\nBut x is the value we have to find, so maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps define u = a t.\n\nSince b =a t, u =b.\n\nWait, no, u =a t =b.\n\nWait, but if u =b, then perhaps not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps express a in terms of u.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write a in terms of t.\n\nWait, but I'm getting stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that a and b are such that t is a rational number, making the equation solvable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about the problem differently.\n\nSince angle AXB is 90 degrees, then X lies on the circle with diameter AB.\n\nSo, the coordinates of X must satisfy the equation of the circle with diameter AB.\n\nGiven that AB is from (0,0) to (x,0), the midpoint is at (x/2, 0), radius x/2.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n(y -0 )\u00b2 + (x' -x/2 )\u00b2 = (x/2 )\u00b2\n\nWhere (x', y ) are the coordinates of X.\n\nBut X is (a,b ), so:\n\nb\u00b2 + (a -x/2 )\u00b2 = (x/2 )\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\nb\u00b2 +a\u00b2 -a x + (x\u00b2 ) /4 =x\u00b2 /4\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 +a\u00b2 -a x =0\n\nWhich is the same as equation (1): a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =a x.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nSo, point X lies on the circle with diameter AB, which we already knew.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find the coordinates of the circumradius for triangle AX D.\n\nThe circumradius of triangle AX D is 13.\n\nSo, perhaps the circumcircle of triangle AX D has radius 13.\n\nGiven that points A(0,0), X(a,b), D(0,24).\n\nWe can find the circumradius using the formula:\n\nR = \\frac{ |AB \\times AC| }{ 4\u0394 }\n\nBut perhaps better to use the circumcircle equation.\n\nThe general equation of a circle passing through A(0,0), X(a,b), D(0,24).\n\nAs before, the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0.\n\nSince A(0,0) is on the circle: F=0.\n\nSo, equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey =0.\n\nPoint D(0,24): 0 +24\u00b2 +0 +E*24=0 => 576 +24 E=0 => E= -24.\n\nSo, equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx -24 y =0.\n\nPoint X(a,b) is on the circle:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + D a -24 b =0.\n\nFrom equation (1): a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =a x, so substituting:\n\na x + D a -24 b=0 => D = (24 b -a x ) /a.\n\nSo, D =24 (b /a ) -x.\n\nBut x = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) /a.\n\nSo, D =24 (b /a ) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) /a = (24 b -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 ) /a.\n\nThus, equation of circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + ( (24 b -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 ) /a ) x -24 y =0.\n\nThe radius R of this circle can be found using the formula for radius in terms of coefficients.\n\nFor a circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + D x + E y + F =0, radius is sqrt( (D/2 )\u00b2 + (E/2 )\u00b2 - F )\n\nHere, F=0, D=(24 b -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 ) /a, E= -24.\n\nSo, radius R is:\n\nsqrt( ( (24 b -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 )/(2 a ) )\u00b2 + ( (-24 ) /2 )\u00b2 )\n\n= sqrt( ( (24 b -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 )\u00b2 )/(4 a\u00b2 ) + 144 )\n\nBut R is given as 13.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( ( (24 b -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 )\u00b2 )/(4 a\u00b2 ) + 144 ) =13\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n( (24 b -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 )\u00b2 )/(4 a\u00b2 ) + 144 =169\n\nSubtract 144:\n\n( (24 b -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 )\u00b2 )/(4 a\u00b2 ) =25\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 a\u00b2:\n\n(24 b -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 )\u00b2 =100 a\u00b2\n\nTake square roots:\n\n24 b -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 = \u00b110 a\n\nBut since a and b are positive, let's see.\n\nCase 1: 24 b -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 =10 a\n\nCase 2: 24 b -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 =-10 a\n\nSo,\n\nCase1: -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 -10 a +24 b=0\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +10 a -24 b=0\n\nBut from equation (1): a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =a x.\n\nSo,\n\na x +10 a -24 b=0\n\n=> a(x +10 )=24 b\n\nBut x = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) /a\n\nSo,\n\na( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) /a +10 )=24 b\n\nSimplify:\n\n(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) +10 a =24 b\n\n=> a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +10 a -24 b =0\n\nWhich is the same as case 1.\n\nSimilarly, case 2:\n\n24 b -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 =-10 a\n\nSo,\n\n24 b +10 a =a\u00b2 +b\u00b2\n\nBut from equation (1): a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =a x\n\nSo,\n\n24 b +10 a =a x\n\nBut x = (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ) /a\n\nSo,\n\n24 b +10 a =a*( (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ) /a )=a\u00b2 +b\u00b2\n\nWhich is,\n\n24 b +10 a =a\u00b2 +b\u00b2\n\nWhich is,\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 -10 a -24 b=0\n\nSo, these are the two cases.\n\nSo, either:\n\nCase1: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +10 a -24 b=0\n\nor\n\nCase2: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 -10 a -24 b=0\n\nSo, let's analyze both.\n\nRemember that in the rectangle, a <x and b <24.\n\nSo, let's explore both cases.\n\nCase1: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +10 a -24 b=0\n\nBut from equation (1): a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =a x\n\nSo,\n\na x +10 a -24 b=0\n\n=> a(x +10 )=24 b\n\n=> b= [a (x +10 ) ] /24\n\nBut x = (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ) /a\n\nSo,\n\nb= [a ( (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ) /a +10 ) ] /24\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ) +10 a ] /24\n\nMultiply both sides by24:\n\n24 b= a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +10 a\n\nBut this is exactly the equation in case1: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +10 a -24 b=0\n\nSo, no new information.\n\nSimilarly, case2: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 -10 a -24 b=0\n\nBut from equation (1): a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =a x\n\nSo,\n\na x -10 a -24 b=0\n\n=> a(x -10 )=24 b\n\n=> b= [a (x -10 ) ] /24\n\nAgain, x = (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ) /a\n\nSo,\n\nb= [a ( (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ) /a -10 ) ] /24\n\n= [ (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ) -10 a ] /24\n\nMultiply both sides by24:\n\n24 b =a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 -10 a\n\nWhich is the equation in case2.\n\nSo, in both cases, substituting back gives the same equations.\n\nTherefore, we have two possibilities:\n\nEither,\n\nCase1: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +10 a -24 b=0\n\nOr,\n\nCase2: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 -10 a -24 b=0\n\nSo, let's try to solve these equations.\n\nStarting with Case1:\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +10 a -24 b=0\n\nBut from equation (1): a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =a x\n\nSo,\n\na x +10 a -24 b=0\n\n=> a(x +10 )=24 b\n\nBut x = (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ) /a\n\nSo,\n\na ( (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ) /a +10 )=24 b\n\nSimplify:\n\n(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ) +10 a =24 b\n\nBut from equation (1): a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =a x, which is equal to a*( (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ) /a )=a\u00b2 +b\u00b2\n\nSo, it's consistent.\n\nBut how to find a and b.\n\nWe also have from triangle AX D: (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 )(a\u00b2 + (24 -b )\u00b2 )=676 a\u00b2\n\nFrom case1: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =24 b -10 a\n\nSo, substituting into equation:\n\n(24 b -10 a )( (24 b -10 a ) + (24 -b )\u00b2 )=676 a\u00b2\n\nWait, no, let me see.\n\nWait, (a\u00b2 + (24 -b )\u00b2 )= a\u00b2 + (24 -b )\u00b2\n\nWe can write in terms of case1.\n\nBut perhaps let me compute (24 -b )\u00b2.\n\n(24 -b )\u00b2=576 -48 b +b\u00b2\n\nSo, (a\u00b2 + (24 -b )\u00b2 )=a\u00b2 +576 -48 b +b\u00b2= (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ) +576 -48 b\n\nFrom case1: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =24 b -10 a\n\nSo,\n\n= (24 b -10 a ) +576 -48 b\n\n= -24 b -10 a +576\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 )(a\u00b2 + (24 -b )\u00b2 )= (24 b -10 a )*(-24 b -10 a +576 )=676 a\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n(24 b -10 a )*(-24 b -10 a +576 )=676 a\u00b2\n\nLet me compute this product:\n\nLet me denote term1=24 b -10 a\n\nterm2= -24 b -10 a +576\n\nSo,\n\nterm1 * term2 = (24 b -10 a )*(-24 b -10 a +576 )\n\nMultiply term1 and term2:\n\n=24 b*(-24 b ) +24 b*(-10 a ) +24 b*576 -10 a*(-24 b ) -10 a*(-10 a ) +(-10 a )*576\n\nCompute each term:\n\n= -576 b\u00b2 -240 a b +13824 b +240 a b +100 a\u00b2 -5760 a\n\nSimplify:\n\n-576 b\u00b2 -240 a b +13824 b +240 a b +100 a\u00b2 -5760 a\n\nThe -240 a b and +240 a b terms cancel.\n\nSo,\n\n= -576 b\u00b2 +13824 b +100 a\u00b2 -5760 a\n\nSo,\n\n-576 b\u00b2 +13824 b +100 a\u00b2 -5760 a =676 a\u00b2\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-576 b\u00b2 +13824 b +100 a\u00b2 -5760 a -676 a\u00b2=0\n\nSimplify:\n\n-576 b\u00b2 +13824 b -576 a\u00b2 -5760 a=0\n\nDivide all terms by -576:\n\nb\u00b2 -24 b +a\u00b2 +10 a=0\n\nWhich is,\n\na\u00b2 +10 a +b\u00b2 -24 b=0\n\nBut from case1: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +10 a -24 b=0\n\nSo, it's the same equation. So, no new information.\n\nSo, case1 leads us back to the same equation, which suggests that the equation is dependent.\n\nSo, perhaps case1 doesn't give us a solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe case2.\n\nCase2: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 -10 a -24 b=0\n\nSimilarly, from equation (1): a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =a x\n\nSo,\n\na x -10 a -24 b=0\n\n=>a(x -10 )=24 b\n\n=>b= [a (x -10 ) ] /24\n\nBut x = (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ) /a\n\nSo,\n\nb= [a ( (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ) /a -10 ) ] /24\n\n= [ (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ) -10 a ] /24\n\nMultiply both sides by24:\n\n24 b =a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 -10 a\n\nWhich is the equation in case2.\n\nSo, again, similar to case1, we can substitute into the product equation.\n\nSo, (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 )(a\u00b2 + (24 -b )\u00b2 )=676 a\u00b2\n\nBut from case2: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =24 b +10 a\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, case2: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 -10 a -24 b=0 => a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=10 a +24 b\n\nSo,\n\n(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 )=10 a +24 b\n\nSo, (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 )(a\u00b2 + (24 -b )\u00b2 )=(10 a +24 b )(a\u00b2 + (24 -b )\u00b2 )=676 a\u00b2\n\nAgain, compute a\u00b2 + (24 -b )\u00b2 =a\u00b2 +576 -48 b +b\u00b2= (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ) +576 -48 b\n\nFrom case2: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =10 a +24 b\n\nSo,\n\n=10 a +24 b +576 -48 b=10 a -24 b +576\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(10 a +24 b )(10 a -24 b +576 )=676 a\u00b2\n\nLet me compute this product.\n\nLet me denote term1=10 a +24 b\n\nterm2=10 a -24 b +576\n\nSo,\n\nterm1 * term2= (10 a +24 b )(10 a -24 b +576 )\n\nMultiply term1 and term2:\n\n=10 a*(10 a ) +10 a*(-24 b ) +10 a*576 +24 b*(10 a ) +24 b*(-24 b ) +24 b*576\n\nCompute each term:\n\n=100 a\u00b2 -240 a b +5760 a +240 a b -576 b\u00b2 +13824 b\n\nSimplify:\n\n100 a\u00b2 -240 a b +5760 a +240 a b -576 b\u00b2 +13824 b\n\nThe -240 a b and +240 a b terms cancel.\n\nSo,\n\n=100 a\u00b2 +5760 a -576 b\u00b2 +13824 b\n\nSo,\n\n100 a\u00b2 +5760 a -576 b\u00b2 +13824 b=676 a\u00b2\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n100 a\u00b2 +5760 a -576 b\u00b2 +13824 b -676 a\u00b2=0\n\nSimplify:\n\n-576 a\u00b2 +5760 a -576 b\u00b2 +13824 b=0\n\nDivide all terms by -576:\n\na\u00b2 -10 a +b\u00b2 -24 b=0\n\nWhich is,\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 -10 a -24 b=0\n\nWhich is exactly case2.\n\nSo, again, it leads back to the same equation.\n\nSo, this suggests that both cases lead to dependent equations.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps consider that the two equations we have are:\n\nFrom case1 or case2, and from the product equation leading back to the same equation.\n\nSo, perhaps we can combine these.\n\nWait, in case1: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +10 a -24 b=0\n\nAnd the product equation gives us nothing new.\n\nSimilarly, in case2: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 -10 a -24 b=0\n\nSo, let's perhaps use case2.\n\nFrom case2: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =10 a +24 b\n\nSo, we can write x = (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ) /a = (10 a +24 b ) /a =10 +24 (b /a )\n\nLet me set t =b /a, so b =a t\n\nSo, x=10 +24 t\n\nSo, now, in terms of t.\n\nSo, x=10 +24 t\n\nWe can also write c =x -a =10 +24 t -a\n\nBut c =b\u00b2 /a = (a\u00b2 t\u00b2 ) /a =a t\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n10 +24 t -a =a t\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\na t\u00b2 +a -24 t -10=0\n\nSo,\n\na(t\u00b2 +1 )=24 t +10\n\nThus,\n\na=(24 t +10 ) / (t\u00b2 +1 )\n\nSo, now, we can express a in terms of t.\n\nSimilarly, b =a t = t*(24 t +10 ) / (t\u00b2 +1 )\n\nSo, b= (24 t\u00b2 +10 t ) / (t\u00b2 +1 )\n\nSo, now, we can express a and b in terms of t.\n\nNow, let's go back to the product equation.\n\nFrom triangle AX D:\n\n(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 )(a\u00b2 + (24 -b )\u00b2 )=676 a\u00b2\n\nBut from case2: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=10 a +24 b\n\nSo, substituting,\n\n(10 a +24 b )(a\u00b2 + (24 -b )\u00b2 )=676 a\u00b2\n\nWe already did this and it led back to case2.\n\nBut perhaps, given that a and b are expressed in terms of t, we can substitute into the product equation.\n\nSo, since we have a and b in terms of t, we can substitute into the product equation.\n\nBut we have already used the product equation, so perhaps we need another equation.\n\nWait, from triangle BXC, we have another equation:\n\n( (x -a )\u00b2 +b\u00b2 )( (x -a )\u00b2 + (24 -b )\u00b2 )=900 (x -a )\u00b2\n\nBut x -a =c =a t\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n(c\u00b2 +b\u00b2 )(c\u00b2 + (24 -b )\u00b2 )=900 c\u00b2\n\nSubstituting c =a t\u00b2, b =a t,\n\nLeft side:\n\n( a\u00b2 t^4 +a\u00b2 t\u00b2 )( a\u00b2 t^4 + (24 -a t )\u00b2 )= [a\u00b2 t\u00b2 (t\u00b2 +1 ) ] [ a\u00b2 t^4 + (24 -a t )\u00b2 ]\n\nRight side:\n\n900 a\u00b2 t^4\n\nBut this seems complicated, but since a is expressed in terms of t, let's substitute a=(24 t +10 ) / (t\u00b2 +1 )\n\nSo, let me compute each part.\n\nFirst, compute a=(24 t +10 ) / (t\u00b2 +1 )\n\nCompute c =a t\u00b2 = (24 t +10 ) t\u00b2 / (t\u00b2 +1 )= (24 t^3 +10 t\u00b2 ) / (t\u00b2 +1 )\n\nSimilarly, b =a t= (24 t +10 ) t / (t\u00b2 +1 )= (24 t\u00b2 +10 t ) / (t\u00b2 +1 )\n\nCompute (c\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ):\n\n= [ (24 t^3 +10 t\u00b2 )\u00b2 + (24 t\u00b2 +10 t )\u00b2 ] / (t\u00b2 +1 )^2\n\nFactor numerator:\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (24 t^3 +10 t\u00b2 )\u00b2 = t^4 (24 t +10 )\u00b2 = t^4 (576 t\u00b2 + 480 t +100 )\n\nSecond term: (24 t\u00b2 +10 t )\u00b2 =t\u00b2 (24 t +10 )\u00b2= t\u00b2 (576 t\u00b2 +480 t +100 )\n\nSo,\n\nNumerator:\n\n= t^4 (576 t\u00b2 +480 t +100 ) + t\u00b2 (576 t\u00b2 +480 t +100 )\n\nFactor out (576 t\u00b2 +480 t +100 ):\n\n= (576 t\u00b2 +480 t +100 )(t^4 +t\u00b2 )\n\n= (576 t\u00b2 +480 t +100 ) t\u00b2 (t\u00b2 +1 )\n\nSo,\n\n(c\u00b2 +b\u00b2 )= [ (576 t\u00b2 +480 t +100 ) t\u00b2 (t\u00b2 +1 ) ] / (t\u00b2 +1 )^2 = [ (576 t\u00b2 +480 t +100 ) t\u00b2 ] / (t\u00b2 +1 )\n\nSimilarly, compute (c\u00b2 + (24 -b )\u00b2 ):\n\n= c\u00b2 + (24 -b )\u00b2\n\n= [ (24 t^3 +10 t\u00b2 )\u00b2 + (24 - (24 t\u00b2 +10 t ) / (t\u00b2 +1 ))\u00b2 ] / (t\u00b2 +1 )^2\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute directly.\n\nCompute 24 -b =24 - (24 t\u00b2 +10 t ) / (t\u00b2 +1 )= [24(t\u00b2 +1 ) -24 t\u00b2 -10 t ] / (t\u00b2 +1 )= [24 t\u00b2 +24 -24 t\u00b2 -10 t ] / (t\u00b2 +1 )= (24 -10 t ) / (t\u00b2 +1 )\n\nSo, (24 -b )\u00b2= (24 -10 t )\u00b2 / (t\u00b2 +1 )\u00b2= (576 -480 t +100 t\u00b2 ) / (t\u00b2 +1 )\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n(c\u00b2 + (24

So, it might intersect the rectangle at other points.\n\nBut since X is inside, perhaps the other intersection is the point we need.\n\nBut how to find it.\n\nAlternatively, since the circle equation is (a -5 )\u00b2 + (b -12 )\u00b2=169\n\nWe can parameterize it.\n\nLet me set:\n\na -5=13 cos \u03b8\n\nb -12=13 sin \u03b8\n\nSo,\n\na=5 +13 cos \u03b8\n\nb=12 +13 sin \u03b8\n\nSince X is inside the rectangle, a must be less than x, and b must be less than24.\n\nBut x=10 +24 t=10 +24*(b /a )\n\nBut b=12 +13 sin \u03b8\n\na=5 +13 cos \u03b8\n\nSo,\n\nx=10 +24*(12 +13 sin \u03b8 )/(5 +13 cos \u03b8 )\n\nHmm, complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps find \u03b8 such that a and b are within the rectangle.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps find when b=24.\n\nBut since b <24, but the circle might have b=24 at some point.\n\nSet b=24:\n\n(a -5 )\u00b2 + (24 -12 )\u00b2=169\n\n=> (a -5 )\u00b2 +144=169\n\n=> (a -5 )\u00b2=25\n\n=> a -5=\u00b15\n\nSo, a=10 or a=0\n\nBut a=0 is point A, so the other is a=10, b=24.\n\nBut b=24 is on the top side of the rectangle, so point X is at (10,24 ), but since it must be inside, so not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, check when a=0:\n\n(0 -5 )\u00b2 + (b -12 )\u00b2=169\n\n25 + (b -12 )\u00b2=169\n\n(b -12 )\u00b2=144\n\nb -12=\u00b112\n\nSo, b=24 or0. So, points (0,24 ) and (0,0 ). Again, on the boundary.\n\nSo, the circle intersects the rectangle only at the corners, so internal points must be on the arc between (0,0 ) and somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the circle also intersects the other sides.\n\nFor a= x, the right side.\n\nBut x is unknown.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the circle also passes through point D(0,24 ).\n\nCompute distance from (5,12 ) to (0,24 ):\n\nsqrt(25 +144 )=13. Yes, so the circle passes through (0,24 ) as well.\n\nSo, points A(0,0 ) and D(0,24 ) lie on the circle.\n\nSo, the circle intersects the rectangle at A and D, but X is another point on the circle inside the rectangle.\n\nSo, to find X, we need another intersection.\n\nBut without more constraints, it's difficult.\n\nBut perhaps given the problem is designed, the length AB is 13.\n\nWait, but wait, in the circle (a-5 )\u00b2 + (b-12 )\u00b2=169, the center is at (5,12 ), radius13.\n\nSo, the circle passes through (0,0 ), (0,24 ), and the center is (5,12 ).\n\nSo, the point X is somewhere on this circle inside the rectangle.\n\nBut how to find a and b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point X is such that triangles AX D and BXC are both acute.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the circumradius condition is key.\n\nBut I think I'm stuck here.\n\nWait, perhaps in both cases, the equation from the product equation simplifies to an identity, meaning that for any t, the equation holds, but the other equation from triangle BXC must hold.\n\nSo, perhaps I can go back to the equation for triangle BXC.\n\nWe had:\n\n(576 t^6 +480 t^5 +100 t^4 +576 -480 t +100 t\u00b2 ) / (t\u00b2 +1 )\u00b2=900 (24 t^3 +10 t\u00b2 )\u00b2 / (t\u00b2 +1 )\u00b2\n\nWait, no, earlier, we had:\n\n[ (576 t\u00b2 +480 t +100 ) t\u00b2 ] / (t\u00b2 +1 ) * [576 t^6 +480 t^5 +100 t^4 +576 -480 t +100 t\u00b2 ] / (t\u00b2 +1 )\u00b2=900 [ (24 t^3 +10 t\u00b2 )\u00b2 ] / (t\u00b2 +1 )\u00b2\n\nBut as we saw, the left side simplifies due to numerator being 676(t\u00b2 +1 ) in one term, leading to 676/(t\u00b2 +1 )\n\nBut in any case, the equation reduces to an identity, so perhaps we need to accept that t can be any value, but the conditions of the problem must fix t.\n\nBut I can't see another equation to fix t.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that triangles AX D and BXC are both acute.\n\nWhich means all their angles are less than 90 degrees.\n\nSo, for triangle AX D to be acute, the square of each side must be less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC.\n\nSo, for triangle AX D:\n\nAX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 > AD\u00b2\n\nAX\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 > XD\u00b2\n\nXD\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 > AX\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC:\n\nBX\u00b2 + XC\u00b2 > BC\u00b2\n\nBX\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 > XC\u00b2\n\nXC\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 > BX\u00b2\n\nGiven that AD=24, BC=24.\n\nSo, for triangle AX D:\n\n1) AX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 >24\u00b2=576\n\n2) AX\u00b2 +24\u00b2 >XD\u00b2\n\n3) XD\u00b2 +24\u00b2 >AX\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC:\n\n1) BX\u00b2 + XC\u00b2 >576\n\n2) BX\u00b2 +576 >XC\u00b2\n\n3) XC\u00b2 +576 >BX\u00b2\n\nBut since we don't know which angles are acute, perhaps it's too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fact that the circumradius is given can help.\n\nBut I don't know.\n\nWait, another thought. Since both triangles AX D and BXC have known circumradii, and we have expressions for their sides, perhaps we can use the formula:\n\nR = \\frac{abc}{4\u0394}\n\nBut for triangle AX D:\n\nR=13= (AX * XD * AD ) / (4 * area )\n\nWe already used this.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC:\n\nR=15= (BX * XC * BC ) / (4 * area )\n\nBut perhaps considering that, and knowing that area of AX D is12 a, and area of BXC is12 (x -a )\n\nSo,\n\nFor AX D:\n\n13= (AX * XD *24 ) / (4 *12 a ) => AX * XD=26 a\n\nSimilarly, for BXC:\n\n15= (BX * XC *24 ) / (4 *12 (x -a ) ) => BX * XC=30 (x -a )\n\nBut we already used these.\n\nSo, I think we might have to accept that the problem requires a system of equations that might not have an easy algebraic solution, and perhaps AB is 13.\n\nBut wait, given that the circle is centered at (5,12 ) with radius13, and AB is x=10 +24 t.\n\nIf X is at (5,12 ), which is the center, then a=5, b=12.\n\nBut does that satisfy equation (1):\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =25 +144=169= a x=5 x =>x=169 /5=33.8\n\nBut then, point X is at (5,12 ), which is inside the rectangle.\n\nBut let's check if triangles AX D and BXC are acute.\n\nCompute sides for triangle AX D:\n\nAX: distance from A(0,0 ) to X(5,12 )=sqrt(25 +144 )=13\n\nXD: distance from X(5,12 ) to D(0,24 )=sqrt(25 +144 )=13\n\nAD=24\n\nSo, triangle AX D has sides13,13,24.\n\nCheck if it's acute.\n\nUsing the law of cosines:\n\nFor angle at X:\n\ncos(theta )=(13\u00b2 +13\u00b2 -24\u00b2 )/(2*13*13 )=(169 +169 -576 )/(338 )=(338 -576 )/338=(-238 )/338\u2248-0.704\n\nSo, angle is obtuse.\n\nBut problem states that both triangles are acute.\n\nSo, point X cannot be at (5,12 ).\n\nThus, X is not the center.\n\nSo, perhaps another point.\n\nWait, but if X is on the circle, but not the center, then the triangles can be acute.\n\nWait, but how to ensure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps AB is13.\n\nWait, but in that case, x=13.\n\nBut from the circle equation, a=5 +13 cos \u03b8, b=12 +13 sin \u03b8.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps with x=13, compute a and b.\n\nWait, x=13, so from equation (1): a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=13 a\n\nFrom case2: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=10 a +24 b\n\nSo,\n\n13 a=10 a +24 b =>3 a=24 b =>a=8 b\n\nSo, a=8 b\n\nSubstitute into a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=13 a:\n\n64 b\u00b2 +b\u00b2=13*8 b =>65 b\u00b2=104 b =>65 b\u00b2 -104 b=0 =>b(65 b -104 )=0\n\nSo, b=0 or b=104/65=1.6\n\nBut b=0 is point A, so the other solution is b=1.6, a=8*1.6=12.8\n\nSo, a=12.8, b=1.6\n\nCheck if they satisfy case2:\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2=12.8\u00b2 +1.6\u00b2=163.84 +2.56=166.4\n\n10 a +24 b=10*12.8 +24*1.6=128 +38.4=166.4\n\nYes, it satisfies.\n\nSo, x=13, a=12.8, b=1.6\n\nNow, check if triangles AX D and BXC are acute.\n\nCompute sides:\n\nTriangle AX D:\n\nAX: sqrt(12.8\u00b2 +1.6\u00b2 )=sqrt(163.84 +2.56 )=sqrt(166.4 )\u224812.9\n\nXD: sqrt(12.8\u00b2 + (24 -1.6 )\u00b2 )=sqrt(163.84 + (22.4 )\u00b2 )=sqrt(163.84 +501.76 )=sqrt(665.6 )\u224825.8\n\nAD=24\n\nCheck if all angles are acute.\n\nUsing the law of cosines:\n\nFor angle at A:\n\ncos(theta )=(AX\u00b2 +AD\u00b2 -XD\u00b2 )/(2*AX*AD )\n\n= (166.4 +576 -665.6 )/(2*12.9*24 )\n\n= (166.4 +576=742.4; 742.4 -665.6=76.8 )/(628.8 )\n\n=76.8 /628.8\u22480.122\n\nSo, angle\u224883 degrees, acute.\n\nFor angle at D:\n\ncos(theta )=(XD\u00b2 +AD\u00b2 -AX\u00b2 )/(2*XD*AD )\n\n= (665.6 +576 -166.4 )/(2*25.8*24 )\n\n= (665.6 +576=1241.6; 1241.6 -166.4=1075.2 )/(1252.8 )\n\n\u22481075.2 /1252.8\u22480.858\n\nAngle\u224830.9 degrees, acute.\n\nFor angle at X:\n\ncos(theta )=(AX\u00b2 +XD\u00b2 -AD\u00b2 )/(2*AX*XD )\n\n= (166.4 +665.6 -576 )/(2*12.9*25.8 )\n\n= (832 -576=256 )/(664.  )\n\n=256 /664\u22480.385\n\nAngle\u224867 degrees, acute.\n\nSo, triangle AX D is acute.\n\nSimilarly, check triangle BXC.\n\nPoint X is at (12.8,1.6 ), point B is at (13,0 ), point C is at (13,24 )\n\nCompute sides:\n\nBX: distance from B(13,0 ) to X(12.8,1.6 )=sqrt( (13-12.8 )\u00b2 + (0 -1.6 )\u00b2 )=sqrt(0.04 +2.56 )=sqrt(2.6 )\u22481.612\n\nXC: distance from X(12.8,1.6 ) to C(13,24 )=sqrt( (13 -12.8 )\u00b2 + (24 -1.6 )\u00b2 )=sqrt(0.04 +501.76 )=sqrt(501.8 )\u224822.4\n\nBC=24\n\nCheck angles:\n\nFor angle at B:\n\ncos(theta )=(BX\u00b2 +BC\u00b2 -XC\u00b2 )/(2*BX*BC )\n\n= (2.6 +576 -501.8 )/(2*1.612*24 )\n\n= (77.8 )/(79.  )\n\n\u224877.8 /79\u22480.985\n\nAngle\u224810 degrees, acute.\n\nFor angle at C:\n\ncos(theta )=(XC\u00b2 +BC\u00b2 -BX\u00b2 )/(2*XC*BC )\n\n= (501.8 +576 -2.6 )/(2*22.4*24 )\n\n= (1075.2 )/(1075.2 )\n\n=1\n\nSo, angle=0 degrees, which is degenerate.

)\u00b2 )=sqrt(576 +576 )=24\u221a2\u224833.94\n\nBut then, a and b can be found.\n\nFrom case2: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=10 a +24 b\n\nFrom equation (1): a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=24\u221a2 a\n\nSo,\n\n24\u221a2 a=10 a +24 b =>(24\u221a2 -10 )a=24 b =>b= [ (24\u221a2 -10 ) /24 ] a\n\nSo, b= [\u221a2 -5/12 ]a\n\nNow, from equation (1):\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2=24\u221a2 a\n\nSubstitute b= [\u221a2 -5/12 ]a\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 + [ (\u221a2 -5/12 )a ]\u00b2=24\u221a2 a\n\nCompute:\n\na\u00b2 + ( (\u221a2 -5/12 )\u00b2 )a\u00b2=24\u221a2 a\n\nFactor a\u00b2:\n\n[1 + ( (\u221a2 -5/12 )\u00b2 ) ] a\u00b2=24\u221a2 a\n\nDivide both sides by a (a \u22600 ):\n\n[1 + ( (\u221a2 -5/12 )\u00b2 ) ] a=24\u221a2\n\nCompute (\u221a2 -5/12 )\u00b2=2 - (2*\u221a2*5/12 ) +25/144=2 - (5\u221a2 /6 ) +25/144\n\nSo,\n\n1 +2 - (5\u221a2 /6 ) +25/144=3 - (5\u221a2 /6 ) +25/144\n\nConvert to common denominator:\n\n= (432/144 ) - (120\u221a2 /144 ) +25/144= (432 +25 )/144 - (120\u221a2 )/144=457/144 - (120\u221a2 )/144\n\nThus,\n\n[457 -120\u221a2 ] /144 *a=24\u221a2\n\nSo,\n\na=24\u221a2 *144 / (457 -120\u221a2 )\n\nRationalize denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (457 +120\u221a2 ):\n\na=24\u221a2 *144*(457 +120\u221a2 ) / [ (457 )\u00b2 - (120\u221a2 )\u00b2 ]\n\nCompute denominator:\n\n457\u00b2=208,849\n\n(120\u221a2 )\u00b2=120\u00b2 *2=14,400*2=28,800\n\nSo,\n\nDenominator=208,849 -28,800=180,049\n\nNumerator=24\u221a2 *144*(457 +120\u221a2 )\n\nCompute step by step.\n\n24*144=3,456\n\nSo,\n\n3,456\u221a2 *(457 +120\u221a2

expression, and likely not an integer.\n\nThus, this suggests that x=24\u221a2 is not a nice number.\n\nBut since the problem is designed, perhaps the answer is25.\n\nBut as above, when x=25, triangle BXC is obtuse.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is13, but when x=13, triangle BXC is degenerate.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct answer is25.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says both triangles are acute.\n\nSo, perhaps my earlier approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use coordinate geometry to find AB.\n\nBut as I tried earlier, it's messy.\n\nWait, perhaps think in terms of vectors.\n\nGiven that angle AXB is90 degrees, vectors XA and XB are perpendicular.\n\nSo,\n\n( XA ) \u00b7 ( XB )=0\n\nXA= A -X= (-a, -b )\n\nXB= B -X= (x -a, -b )\n\nDot product: (-a)(x -a ) + (-b)(-b )=0 => -a x +a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=0 =>a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =a x\n\nWhich is equation (1).\n\nSo, from here, we can express x=(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ) /a\n\nNow, for triangle AX D:\n\nCircumradius R1=13.\n\nUsing formula R=abc/(4\u0394 )\n\nBut sides:\n\nAX= sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 )\n\nXD= sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 -b )\u00b2 )\n\nAD=24\n\nArea=12 a\n\n",
