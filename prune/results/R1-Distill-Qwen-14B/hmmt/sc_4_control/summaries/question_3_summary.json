      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest possible value of \\( xyz \\) given three equations involving exponents and logarithms. All variables \\( x, y, z \\) are positive real numbers. Let me write down the given equations to get a clear picture.\n\nThe equations are:\n1. \\( x^{\\log_{2}(y z)} = 2^8 \\cdot 3^4 \\)\n2. \\( y^{\\log_{2}(z x)} = 2^9 \\cdot 3^6 \\)\n3. \\( z^{\\log_{2}(x y)} = 2^5 \\cdot 3^{10} \\)\n\nHmm, these equations look a bit complicated because of the exponents and logarithms. Maybe I can take the logarithm of both sides to simplify them. Since the base of the logarithm is 2, perhaps using base 2 will help simplify the expressions.\n\nLet me recall that \\( a^{\\log_b c} = c^{\\log_b a} \\). Wait, is that right? Let me check with a simple example. Let\u2019s say \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 2 \\), \\( c = 4 \\). Then LHS is \\( 2^{\\log_2 4} = 2^2 = 4 \\). RHS is \\( 4^{\\log_2 2} = 4^1 = 4 \\). Okay, so that identity works. Cool, maybe I can use that to rewrite the equations.\n\nSo, applying this identity to each equation:\n\n1. \\( x^{\\log_{2}(y z)} = (y z)^{\\log_{2} x} = 2^8 \\cdot 3^4 \\)\n2. \\( y^{\\log_{2}(z x)} = (z x)^{\\log_{2} y} = 2^9 \\cdot 3^6 \\)\n3. \\( z^{\\log_{2}(x y)} = (x y)^{\\log_{2} z} = 2^5 \\cdot 3^{10} \\)\n\nHmm, so each equation is now of the form \\( (y z)^{\\log_2 x} = 2^8 \\cdot 3^4 \\) and similarly for the others. Maybe it's helpful to take logarithms on both sides to bring down the exponents.\n\nLet me take the logarithm base 2 of both sides in each equation. Since everything is positive, taking logs is allowed.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\n\\( \\log_2 \\left( (y z)^{\\log_{2} x} \\right ) = \\log_2 (2^8 \\cdot 3^4 ) \\)\n\nSimplify the left side using logarithm power rule: \\( \\log_b (a^c) = c \\log_b a \\)\n\nSo, \\( (\\log_2 (y z)) \\cdot (\\log_2 x) = \\log_2 (2^8 \\cdot 3^4 ) \\)\n\nSimilarly for the other equations.\n\nWait, but the right-hand side has a logarithm of a product, which can be split into the sum of logs:\n\n\\( \\log_2 (2^8 \\cdot 3^4 ) = \\log_2 2^8 + \\log_2 3^4 = 8 + 4 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation:\n\n\\( \\log_2 \\left( (z x)^{\\log_{2} y} \\right ) = \\log_2 (2^9 \\cdot 3^6 ) \\)\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n\\( (\\log_2 (z x)) \\cdot (\\log_2 y) = 9 + 6 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nAnd the third equation:\n\n\\( \\log_2 \\left( (x y)^{\\log_{2} z} \\right ) = \\log_2 (2^5 \\cdot 3^{10}) \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( (\\log_2 (x y)) \\cdot (\\log_2 z) = 5 + 10 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nSo now, I have three equations:\n\n1. \\( (\\log_2 y + \\log_2 z) \\cdot \\log_2 x = 8 + 4 \\log_2 3 \\) \u2014 Equation (1)\n2. \\( (\\log_2 z + \\log_2 x) \\cdot \\log_2 y = 9 + 6 \\log_2 3 \\) \u2014 Equation (2)\n3. \\( (\\log_2 x + \\log_2 y) \\cdot \\log_2 z = 5 + 10 \\log_2 3 \\) \u2014 Equation (3)\n\nThis looks a bit more manageable. Let me denote \\( a = \\log_2 x \\), \\( b = \\log_2 y \\), and \\( c = \\log_2 z \\). This substitution should make the equations cleaner.\n\nSo substituting, the equations become:\n\n1. \\( (b + c) a = 8 + 4 d \\) \u2014 Equation (1), where \\( d = \\log_2 3 \\)\n2. \\( (c + a) b = 9 + 6 d \\) \u2014 Equation (2)\n3. \\( (a + b) c = 5 + 10 d \\) \u2014 Equation (3)\n\nSo now, I have a system of three equations with three variables \\( a, b, c \\) and a constant \\( d \\) which is \\( \\log_2 3 \\). Hmm, maybe I can solve for \\( a, b, c \\) in terms of \\( d \\).\n\nLet me write the equations:\n\n1. \\( a(b + c) = 8 + 4d \\) \u2014 (1)\n2. \\( b(a + c) = 9 + 6d \\) \u2014 (2)\n3. \\( c(a + b) = 5 + 10d \\) \u2014 (3)\n\nHmm, these are linear equations in terms of \\( a, b, c \\). Maybe I can express each equation as follows:\n\nEquation (1): \\( ab + ac = 8 + 4d \\) \u2014 (1)\nEquation (2): \\( ab + bc = 9 + 6d \\) \u2014 (2)\nEquation (3): \\( ac + bc = 5 + 10d \\) \u2014 (3)\n\nNow, let's denote:\n\nLet me call equation (1) as E1, (2) as E2, and (3) as E3.\n\nIf I subtract E1 from E2, I get:\n\nE2 - E1: \\( (ab + bc) - (ab + ac) = (9 + 6d) - (8 + 4d) \\)\nSimplify:\n\\( bc - ac = 1 + 2d \\)\nFactor:\n\\( c(b - a) = 1 + 2d \\) \u2014 Let's call this Equation (4)\n\nSimilarly, subtract E2 from E3:\n\nE3 - E2: \\( (ac + bc) - (ab + bc) = (5 + 10d) - (9 + 6d) \\)\nSimplify:\n\\( ac - ab = -4 + 4d \\)\nFactor:\n\\( a(c - b) = -4 + 4d \\) \u2014 Equation (5)\n\nAnd subtract E1 from E3:\n\nE3 - E1: \\( (ac + bc) - (ab + ac) = (5 + 10d) - (8 + 4d) \\)\nSimplify:\n\\( bc - ab = -3 + 6d \\)\nFactor:\n\\( b(c - a) = -3 + 6d \\) \u2014 Equation (6)\n\nNow, I have Equations (4), (5), and (6):\n\nEquation (4): \\( c(b - a) = 1 + 2d \\)\nEquation (5): \\( a(c - b) = -4 + 4d \\)\nEquation (6): \\( b(c - a) = -3 + 6d \\)\n\nLet me write them again:\n\n4. \\( c(b - a) = 1 + 2d \\)\n5. \\( a(c - b) = -4 + 4d \\)\n6. \\( b(c - a) = -3 + 6d \\)\n\nHmm, I can notice that \\( (c - b) = -(b - c) \\) and \\( (c - a) = -(a - c) \\). So, perhaps I can express Equations (5) and (6) in terms of Equations (4).\n\nLooking at Equation (4): \\( c(b - a) = 1 + 2d \\)\n\nEquation (5): \\( a(c - b) = a(- (b - c)) = -a(b - c) = -4 + 4d \\)\nBut \\( b - c = -(c - b) \\), so \\( a(c - b) = a(- (b - c)) = -a(b - c) = -4 +4d \\)\nWait, perhaps it's better to relate Equations (4), (5), and (6) together.\n\nFrom Equation (4): \\( c(b - a) = 1 + 2d \\)\nFrom Equation (5): \\( a(c - b) = -4 + 4d \\)\nFrom Equation (6): \\( b(c - a) = -3 + 6d \\)\n\nWait, perhaps I can express the differences \\( (b - a) \\), \\( (c - b) \\), \\( (c - a) \\) in terms of variables.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet \\( p = b - a \\)\nLet \\( q = c - b \\)\nLet \\( r = c - a \\)\n\nBut \\( r = c - a = (c - b) + (b - a) = q + p \\)\n\nSo, the Equations become:\n\nEquation (4): \\( c p = 1 + 2d \\)\nEquation (5): \\( a (-q) = -4 +4d \\) \u21d2 \\( a q = 4 -4d \\)\nEquation (6): \\( b r = b (p + q) = -3 +6d \\)\n\nHmm, but this might complicate things more. Maybe I can express Equations (4), (5), (6) in terms of p, q, r, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can solve for variables step by step.\n\nFrom Equation (4): \\( c (b - a) = 1 + 2d \\)\nFrom Equation (5): \\( a (c - b) = -4 +4d \\)\nFrom Equation (6): \\( b (c - a) = -3 +6d \\)\n\nWait, if I write Equation (4) as \\( c (b - a) = 1 + 2d \\)\nAnd Equation (5) as \\( a (c - b) = -4 +4d \\)\n\nNotice that \\( c - b = - (b - c) \\), so Equation (5) becomes \\( a (- (b - c)) = -a (b - c) = -4 +4d \\)\nWhich implies \\( a (b - c) = 4 -4d \\)\n\nSimilarly, Equation (6): \\( b (c - a) = -3 +6d \\)\nWhich is \\( b (- (a - c)) = -b (a - c) = -3 +6d \\)\nThus, \\( b (a - c) = 3 -6d \\)\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express \\( b - a \\), \\( c - b \\), and \\( c - a \\) from Equations (4), (5), (6) and then relate them.\n\nWait, from Equation (4): \\( c (b - a) = 1 + 2d \\) \u21d2 \\( (b - a) = (1 + 2d)/c \\) \u2014 (4a)\n\nFrom Equation (5): \\( a (c - b) = -4 +4d \\) \u21d2 \\( (c - b) = (-4 +4d)/a \\) \u2014 (5a)\n\nFrom Equation (6): \\( b (c - a) = -3 +6d \\) \u21d2 \\( (c - a) = (-3 +6d)/b \\) \u2014 (6a)\n\nBut also, \\( (c - a) = (c - b) + (b - a) \\)\n\nUsing (5a) and (4a), \\( (c - a) = [ (-4 +4d)/a ] + [ (1 + 2d)/c ] \\)\n\nBut from (6a), \\( (c - a) = (-3 +6d)/b \\)\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\( [ (-4 +4d)/a ] + [ (1 + 2d)/c ] = (-3 +6d)/b \\) \u2014 Equation (7)\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I can express a, b, c in terms of each other.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the original Equations (1), (2), (3):\n\n1. \\( a(b + c) = 8 +4d \\)\n2. \\( b(a + c) = 9 +6d \\)\n3. \\( c(a + b) =5 +10d \\)\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me write S = a + b + c. Then, perhaps express each equation in terms of S.\n\nWait, equation (1): a(b + c) = a(S - a) = 8 +4d\nEquation (2): b(a + c) = b(S - b) =9 +6d\nEquation (3): c(a + b)=c(S - c)=5 +10d\n\nSo, each equation is of the form:\n\na(S - a) = 8 +4d\nb(S - b) =9 +6d\nc(S - c)=5 +10d\n\nHmm, this seems promising. So, equation (1): \\( a(S - a) = 8 +4d \\) can be rewritten as quadratic in a:\n\n\\( a^2 - S a + (8 +4d) =0 \\)\n\nSimilarly,\n\nEquation (2): \\( b^2 - S b + (9 +6d) = 0 \\)\n\nEquation (3): \\( c^2 - S c + (5 +10d) = 0 \\)\n\nSo, each variable satisfies a quadratic equation with the same coefficient for the quadratic term (1), same linear coefficient (-S), but different constants.\n\nBut since a, b, c are different variables, each quadratic may have different roots. However, the roots for each quadratic should be related to the other variables because S is the sum of a, b, c.\n\nWait, this might be a bit abstract. Maybe let me consider that a, b, c are roots of their respective quadratics, and S is the sum of a, b, c. So, perhaps if I can find S, I can find a, b, c.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFrom equation (1): \\( a^2 - S a + (8 +4d) =0 \\)\nFrom equation (2): \\( b^2 - S b + (9 +6d) =0 \\)\nFrom equation (3): \\( c^2 - S c + (5 +10d) =0 \\)\n\nSo, each of a, b, c satisfies a quadratic equation as above.\n\nSince S = a + b + c, I can think of S as a parameter that is consistent across all three quadratics.\n\nLet me try to express the sum S in terms of the quadratics.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe I can consider that the variables a, b, c are interconnected through these quadratics, and S is the sum. Perhaps I can solve for S by combining the equations.\n\nAlternatively, let me add all three equations (1), (2), (3):\n\nEquation (1): \\( a(b + c) =8 +4d \\)\nEquation (2): \\( b(a + c)=9 +6d \\)\nEquation (3): \\( c(a + b)=5 +10d \\)\n\nAdding them together:\n\n\\( a(b + c) + b(a + c) + c(a + b) = (8 +4d) + (9 +6d) + (5 +10d) \\)\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n\\( ab + ac + ab + bc + ac + bc = 2ab + 2ac + 2bc \\)\n\nRight side:\n\n\\( 8 +9 +5 +4d +6d +10d = 22 + 20d \\)\n\nSo, left side is \\( 2(ab + ac + bc) =22 +20d \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\( ab + ac + bc =11 +10d \\) \u2014 Equation (8)\n\nNow, let's note that from equation (1): \\( a(b + c) =8 +4d \\)\nBut \\( b + c = S - a \\), so equation (1): \\( a(S - a) =8 +4d \\)\nSimilarly, equation (2): \\( b(S - b) =9 +6d \\)\nEquation (3): \\( c(S - c)=5 +10d \\)\n\nNow, let me consider that \\( ab + ac + bc =11 +10d \\) from Equation (8).\n\nAlso, \\( S = a + b + c \\). Maybe I can find expressions for ab, ac, bc.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the sum of the products.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + ac + bc)\n\nSo, \\( S^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + ac + bc) \\)\n\nBut from Equations (1), (2), (3), we have expressions for a^2, b^2, c^2.\n\nFrom equation (1): \\( a^2 = S a - (8 +4d) \\)\nFrom equation (2): \\( b^2 = S b - (9 +6d) \\)\nFrom equation (3): \\( c^2 = S c - (5 +10d) \\)\n\nSo, adding these up:\n\n\\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = S(a + b + c) - [ (8 +4d) + (9 +6d) + (5 +10d) ] \\)\nSimplify:\n\n\\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = S^2 - (22 +20d) \\)\n\nSo, \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = S^2 -22 -20d \\)\n\nPlugging back into the expansion of \\( S^2 \\):\n\n\\( S^2 = (S^2 -22 -20d) + 2(ab + ac + bc) \\)\n\nBut from Equation (8), \\( ab + ac + bc =11 +10d \\), so:\n\n\\( S^2 = (S^2 -22 -20d) + 2(11 +10d) \\)\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\( S^2 = S^2 -22 -20d +22 +20d \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( S^2 = S^2 + 0 \\)\n\nHmm, that's an identity. So, this doesn't give me any new information. Which means I have to find another way.\n\nPerhaps I can write down the quadratic equations for a, b, c and think of S as a variable to solve for.\n\nFrom equation (1): \\( a^2 - S a + (8 +4d) =0 \\)\nFrom equation (2): \\( b^2 - S b + (9 +6d) =0 \\)\nFrom equation (3): \\( c^2 - S c + (5 +10d) =0 \\)\n\nLet me denote the three quadratics as:\n\n1. \\( a^2 - S a + C_1 =0 \\), where \\( C_1 =8 +4d \\)\n2. \\( b^2 - S b + C_2 =0 \\), where \\( C_2 =9 +6d \\)\n3. \\( c^2 - S c + C_3 =0 \\), where \\( C_3 =5 +10d \\)\n\nNow, if a, b, c are roots of these quadratics, but they are different variables. However, since S is the sum of a, b, c, perhaps there is a relation between these quadratics.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that a, b, c are roots of the same quadratic, but that's not the case because each has a different constant term.\n\nWait, but if they were roots of the same quadratic, then by Vieta's formula, the sum of roots would be S, and the product would be C1, C2, C3. But since each has a different constant term, that approach might not work.\n\nHmm, maybe I can think of S as a variable and try to find its value.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that each of a, b, c satisfies a quadratic equation in terms of S.\n\nLet me write:\n\nFrom equation (1): \\( a^2 = S a - (8 +4d) \\)\nFrom equation (2): \\( b^2 = S b - (9 +6d) \\)\nFrom equation (3): \\( c^2 = S c - (5 +10d) \\)\n\nNow, let's compute \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\):\n\n\\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = S(a + b + c) - [ (8 +4d) + (9 +6d) + (5 +10d) ] \\)\nWhich is \\( S^2 - (22 +20d) \\)\n\nBut earlier, when expanding \\( S^2 = (a + b + c)^2 \\), we found that \\( S^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + ac + bc) \\). Which, as I found earlier, led to an identity.\n\nSo, perhaps I need another approach.\n\nLet me consider the equations:\n\nEquation (1): \\( a(b + c) =8 +4d \\)\nBut \\( b + c = S -a \\), so:\n\n\\( a(S -a) =8 +4d \\) \u21d2 \\( a S - a^2 =8 +4d \\) \u21d2 \\( a^2 - S a +8 +4d =0 \\)\n\nSimilarly, for b:\n\n\\( b^2 - S b +9 +6d =0 \\)\n\nAnd for c:\n\n\\( c^2 - S c +5 +10d =0 \\)\n\nSo, each of a, b, c is a root of the respective quadratic equations.\n\nBut each quadratic has the same coefficient for \\( x^2 \\) and \\( x \\) terms, but different constants.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of a, b, c as being roots of the same quadratic equation if the constants were the same, but since they are different, that's not possible. So, I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express a, b, c in terms of S.\n\nWait, let me denote:\n\nFrom equation (1): \\( a = [ S \u00b1 sqrt(S^2 -4*(8 +4d)) ] /2 \\)\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nBut since a, b, c are positive real numbers, the discriminant must be positive.\n\nBut this approach may lead to complicated expressions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider ratios between the equations.\n\nLooking back at the original Equations (1), (2), (3):\n\n1. \\( a(b + c) =8 +4d \\)\n2. \\( b(a + c) =9 +6d \\)\n3. \\( c(a + b) =5 +10d \\)\n\nLet me try to find ratios between these equations to eliminate variables.\n\nLet me divide Equation (2) by Equation (1):\n\n\\( \\frac{b(a + c)}{a(b + c)} = \\frac{9 +6d}{8 +4d} \\)\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n\\( \\frac{b}{a} \\cdot \\frac{a + c}{b + c} \\)\n\nLet me denote \\( \\frac{b}{a} = k \\), so \\( b = k a \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( \\frac{a + c}{b + c} = \\frac{a + c}{k a + c} \\). Let me denote this as \\( m \\), so \\( \\frac{a + c}{k a + c} = m \\)\n\nBut this might not be the most straightforward path. Alternatively, perhaps we can express \\( \\frac{a + c}{b + c} \\) as \\( \\frac{a + c}{b + c} = \\frac{a + c}{b + c} \\)\n\nWait, maybe it's better to instead express \\( a + c \\) and \\( b + c \\) in terms of S.\n\nSince \\( a + b + c = S \\), then \\( a + c = S - b \\), and \\( b + c = S - a \\)\n\nSo, substituting these into the ratio:\n\n\\( \\frac{b (S - b)}{a (S - a)} = \\frac{9 +6d}{8 +4d} \\)\n\nSimilarly, Equation (3) divided by Equation (1):\n\n\\( \\frac{c (a + b)}{a (b + c)} = \\frac{5 +10d}{8 +4d} \\)\n\nAgain, \\( a + b = S - c \\), \\( b + c = S - a \\), so:\n\n\\( \\frac{c (S - c)}{a (S - a)} = \\frac{5 +10d}{8 +4d} \\)\n\nHmm, this seems a bit involved, but maybe I can express this as:\n\nLet me denote \\( a (S - a) =8 +4d \\) from Equation (1)\nSimilarly, \\( b (S - b)=9 +6d \\) from Equation (2)\nAnd \\( c (S - c)=5 +10d \\) from Equation (3)\n\nSo, I can write each of these as:\n\n1. \\( a (S - a) =8 +4d \\) \u21d2 \\( a S - a^2 =8 +4d \\)\n2. \\( b S - b^2 =9 +6d \\)\n3. \\( c S - c^2 =5 +10d \\)\n\nLet me denote these as equations (1a), (2a), (3a)\n\nNow, let me subtract equation (1a) from equation (2a):\n\n\\( (b S - b^2) - (a S - a^2 ) = (9 +6d) - (8 +4d) \\)\nSimplify:\n\n\\( (b -a) S - (b^2 - a^2) =1 +2d \\)\nFactor \\( b^2 - a^2 = (b -a)(b + a) \\), so:\n\n\\( (b -a) S - (b -a)(b + a) =1 +2d \\)\nFactor out \\( (b -a) \\):\n\n\\( (b -a)(S - (b + a)) =1 +2d \\)\n\nBut \\( S = a + b + c \\), so \\( S - (b + a) = c \\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\( (b -a) c =1 +2d \\)\n\nWait, this is exactly Equation (4) which we had earlier. So, no new information.\n\nSimilarly, subtracting equation (2a) from equation (3a):\n\n\\( (c S - c^2) - (b S - b^2) = (5 +10d) - (9 +6d) \\)\nSimplify:\n\n\\( (c - b) S - (c^2 - b^2) = -4 +4d \\)\nFactor \\( c^2 - b^2 = (c - b)(c + b) \\), so:\n\n\\( (c - b) S - (c - b)(c + b) = -4 +4d \\)\nFactor out \\( (c - b) \\):\n\n\\( (c -b)(S - (c + b)) = -4 +4d \\)\n\nAgain, \\( S - (c + b) = a \\), so:\n\n\\( (c -b) a = -4 +4d \\)\n\nWhich is Equation (5). So again, same result.\n\nHmm, seems like this approach isn't yielding new information.\n\nPerhaps I can consider that Equations (1a), (2a), (3a) are linear in S.\n\nLet me write them as:\n\n1. \\( -a^2 + S a - (8 +4d) =0 \\)\n2. \\( -b^2 + S b - (9 +6d) =0 \\)\n3. \\( -c^2 + S c - (5 +10d) =0 \\)\n\nSo, for each equation, it's of the form \\( -x^2 + S x - C =0 \\), where x is a, b, c respectively, and C is the respective constant.\n\nWe can write these as:\n\n1. \\( a^2 - S a + (8 +4d) =0 \\)\n2. \\( b^2 - S b + (9 +6d) =0 \\)\n3. \\( c^2 - S c + (5 +10d) =0 \\)\n\nSo, each variable a, b, c is a solution to a quadratic equation with the same coefficient for \\( x^2 \\) and \\( x \\), but different constants.\n\nIf I think of S as a parameter, each quadratic will have two roots. But since a, b, c are all positive, maybe each quadratic will have one positive root and one negative, or both positive. But given the context, it's more likely that a, b, c are positive real numbers, so perhaps each quadratic has two real roots but only one is positive.\n\nBut perhaps it's possible that all quadratics have two positive roots, but it's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that Equations (1a), (2a), (3a) can be related through S.\n\nWait, let me consider that since each quadratic equation has a solution (a, b, c), perhaps S is related to the sum of the roots of these quadratics.\n\nWait, but each quadratic has two roots, but a, b, c are just one root each.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of a, b, c as being roots in such a way that they satisfy certain relationships.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set up a system of equations by expressing S in terms of each variable.\n\nWait, from equation (1a): \\( a S = a^2 +8 +4d \\) \u21d2 \\( S = a + (8 +4d)/a \\)\nSimilarly, from equation (2a): \\( S = b + (9 +6d)/b \\)\nFrom equation (3a): \\( S = c + (5 +10d)/c \\)\n\nThus, all three expressions equal to S:\n\n1. \\( S = a + (8 +4d)/a \\)\n2. \\( S = b + (9 +6d)/b \\)\n3. \\( S = c + (5 +10d)/c \\)\n\nSo, each of these must be equal:\n\n\\( a + (8 +4d)/a = b + (9 +6d)/b = c + (5 +10d)/c = S \\)\n\nSo, perhaps I can set up equations where each expression equals S, and find relations between a, b, c.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n\\( a + \\frac{8 +4d}{a} = b + \\frac{9 +6d}{b} \\)\n\nAnd,\n\n\\( b + \\frac{9 +6d}{b} = c + \\frac{5 +10d}{c} \\)\n\nSo, two equations.\n\nLet me take the first equality:\n\n\\( a + \\frac{8 +4d}{a} = b + \\frac{9 +6d}{b} \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( a b \\) to eliminate denominators:\n\n\\( a^2 b + (8 +4d) b = a b^2 + (9 +6d) a \\)\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\( a^2 b - a b^2 + (8 +4d)b - (9 +6d)a =0 \\)\n\nFactor terms:\n\n\\( a b (a - b) + [ (8 +4d) b - (9 +6d) a ] =0 \\)\n\nHmm, not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can rearrange the terms:\n\n\\( a^2 b - a b^2 = (9 +6d) a - (8 +4d) b \\)\n\nFactor left side:\n\n\\( a b (a - b) = (9 +6d) a - (8 +4d) b \\)\n\nLet me factor the right side:\n\nFactor out a and b:\n\n\\( a b (a - b) = a (9 +6d) - b (8 +4d) \\)\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n\\( a b (a - b) = a (9 +6d) - b (8 +4d) \\)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor the right side:\n\n\\( a (9 +6d) - b (8 +4d) = a (9 +6d) - b (8 +4d) \\)\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n\\( a b (a - b) - a (9 +6d) + b (8 +4d) =0 \\)\n\nFactor terms with a and b:\n\nLet me factor a from the first two terms:\n\n\\( a [ b(a - b) - (9 +6d) ] + b (8 +4d) =0 \\)\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this as a linear equation in terms of a and b.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of this as:\n\nLet me denote \\( k = a/b \\), so \\( a = k b \\)\n\nThen, substituting into the equation:\n\n\\( a + (8 +4d)/a = b + (9 +6d)/b \\)\n\nReplace a with k b:\n\n\\( k b + (8 +4d)/(k b) = b + (9 +6d)/b \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( k b \\) to eliminate denominators:\n\n\\( k^2 b^2 + (8 +4d) = k b^2 + k (9 +6d) \\)\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\( k^2 b^2 -k b^2 -k (9 +6d) + (8 +4d) =0 \\)\n\nFactor terms:\n\n\\( b^2 (k^2 -k) -k (9 +6d) + (8 +4d) =0 \\)\n\nHmm, still complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that \\( k \\) is a constant ratio between a and b, so perhaps expressing in terms of k.\n\nBut this might not be the most straightforward path. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that if I have \\( a + (8 +4d)/a = S \\) and \\( b + (9 +6d)/b = S \\), then:\n\n\\( a + (8 +4d)/a = b + (9 +6d)/b \\)\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n\\( a - b = [ (9 +6d)/b - (8 +4d)/a ] \\)\n\nBut I don't see an immediate simplification.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that \\( a + (8 +4d)/a = b + (9 +6d)/b \\)\n\nLet me denote this equation as:\n\n\\( a + c/a = b + d/b \\), where c and d are constants.\n\nThis is a type of equation that often leads to the difference of variables.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n\\( a - b = (9 +6d)/b - (8 +4d)/a \\)\n\nLet me compute the right side:\n\n\\( (9 +6d)/b - (8 +4d)/a = [ (9 +6d) a - (8 +4d) b ] / (a b) \\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( a - b = [ (9 +6d) a - (8 +4d) b ] / (a b) \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( a b \\):\n\n\\( (a - b) a b = (9 +6d) a - (8 +4d) b \\)\n\nWhich is the same as earlier.\n\nHmm.

Let me take the original Equations (1), (2), (3):\n\n1. \\( a(b + c) =8u +4v \\)\n2. \\( b(a + c)=9u +6v \\)\n3. \\( c(a + b)=5u +10v \\)\n\nLet me take the ratio of Equation (2) to Equation (1):\n\n\\( \\frac{b(a + c)}{a(b + c)} = \\frac{9u +6v}{8u +4v} \\)\n\nSimplify the RHS: Factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: \\( 3(3u +2v) \\)\nDenominator: \\(4(2u +v) \\)\n\nSo, ratio is \\( \\frac{3(3u +2v)}{4(2u +v)} \\)\n\nSimilarly, the LHS ratio:\n\n\\( \\frac{b(a + c)}{a(b + c)} = \\frac{b}{a} \\cdot \\frac{a + c}{b + c} \\)\n\nHmm, perhaps set \\( k = \\frac{b}{a} \\), so \\( b = k a \\)\n\nThen,\n\n\\( \\frac{k a (a + c)}{a (k a + c)} = \\frac{k (a + c)}{k a + c} \\)\n\nLet me denote \\( m = \\frac{a + c}{k a + c} \\), so the LHS becomes \\( k m \\)\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\( k m = \\frac{3(3u +2v)}{4(2u +v)} \\)\n\nHmm, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express \\( a + c = S - b \\), and \\( b + c = S -a \\), as before.\n\nSo, the ratio becomes:\n\n\\( \\frac{b (S - b)}{a (S -a ) } = \\frac{9u +6v}{8u +4v} \\)\n\nSimilarly, as before.\n\nBut this seems like a loop.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that \\( S = a + b + c \\), and from Equations (1), (2), (3), I can express \\( a(b + c ) =8u +4v \\), so \\( a(S -a ) =8u +4v \\), which is a quadratic in a.\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nSo, perhaps I can think of a, b, c as the roots of the quadratic equations \\( x(S -x ) = C \\), where C varies.\n\nBut since S is the same for all, perhaps the product of the roots of each quadratic is known.\n\nWait, for equation (1a): \\( a^2 - S a + C_1 =0 \\), where \\( C_1 =8u +4v \\)\n\nSo, the product of the roots is \\( C_1 \\). Similarly for b and c.\n\nBut since each quadratic corresponds to a single variable (a, b, c), perhaps the other roots are not relevant.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck here. Maybe I can consider specific values for u and v.\n\nBut u = ln 2 \u2248 0.6931, v = ln 3 \u2248 1.0986. But this might not be helpful analytically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that u and v are constants, so I can write the system in terms of u and v and solve for a, b, c.\n\nWait, let me see. From Equations (1), (2), (3), I have:\n\n1. \\( a(b + c ) =8u +4v \\)\n2. \\( b(a + c ) =9u +6v \\)\n3. \\( c(a + b ) =5u +10v \\)\n\nLet me denote these as:\n\nEquation (1): \\( a (S -a ) =8u +4v \\)\nEquation (2): \\( b (S -b ) =9u +6v \\)\nEquation (3): \\( c (S -c ) =5u +10v \\)\n\nSo, each of these is similar to \\( x(S -x ) = K \\), where K is a constant.\n\nThus, perhaps I can express S in terms of a, b, c.\n\nFrom Equation (1): \\( S = a + (8u +4v)/a \\)\nFrom Equation (2): \\( S = b + (9u +6v)/b \\)\nFrom Equation (3): \\( S = c + (5u +10v)/c \\)\n\nSo, all these expressions for S must be equal.\n\nThus,\n\n\\( a + (8u +4v)/a = b + (9u +6v)/b = c + (5u +10v)/c \\)\n\nLet me denote this common value as S. So,\n\n\\( a + (8u +4v)/a = S \\) \u2014 (1b)\n\\( b + (9u +6v)/b = S \\) \u2014 (2b)\n\\( c + (5u +10v)/c = S \\) \u2014 (3b)\n\nSo, each of a, b, c satisfies the equation \\( x + K/x = S \\), where K is a constant.\n\nThis suggests that for each variable, the equation \\( x^2 - S x + K =0 \\) holds.\n\nWhich is consistent with what I had earlier.\n\nThus, for a: \\( a^2 - S a +8u +4v =0 \\)\nFor b: \\( b^2 - S b +9u +6v =0 \\)\nFor c: \\( c^2 - S c +5u +10v =0 \\)\n\nSo, each variable is a root of a quadratic equation with the same S.\n\nBut S is the sum of a, b, c.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can consider that the product of the roots for each quadratic is given.\n\nFor the quadratic in a: product is \\(8u +4v\\), which is a * another root.\n\nSimilarly, for b: product is \\(9u +6v\\), which is b * another root.\n\nBut since a, b, c are positive, perhaps the other roots are negative, which we can ignore.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all quadratics have two positive roots, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that a, b, c are all less than S, since they are parts of S.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each quadratic equation has two roots, one of which is a, b, or c, and the other is something else.\n\nBut without knowing more, it's difficult.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I can consider that the product of the three quadratics' equations can be related to S.\n\nBut this might be too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the three quadratics and see if they can be related.\n\nQuadratic for a: \\( a^2 - S a +8u +4v =0 \\)\nQuadratic for b: \\( b^2 - S b +9u +6v =0 \\)\nQuadratic for c: \\( c^2 - S c +5u +10v =0 \\)\n\nLet me subtract the quadratic for a from the quadratic for b:\n\n\\( b^2 - S b +9u +6v - (a^2 - S a +8u +4v )=0 \\)\nSimplify:\n\n\\( b^2 -a^2 -S (b -a ) + (9u +6v -8u -4v )=0 \\)\nFactor:\n\n\\( (b -a )(b +a ) - S (b -a ) + (u +2v )=0 \\)\nFactor out \\( (b -a ) \\):\n\n\\( (b -a )(b +a - S ) + (u +2v )=0 \\)\n\nBut \\( S = a + b + c \\), so \\( b +a - S = -c \\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\( (b -a ) (-c ) + (u +2v )=0 \\)\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( -c (b -a ) + (u +2v )=0 \\)\nWhich is:\n\n\\( c (a - b ) =u +2v \\)\n\nBut this is exactly Equation (5), which we had earlier.\n\nSo, again, no new information.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can consider that each of the quadratics can be related through S.\n\nWait, perhaps I can set up a system where I express S in terms of a, b, c from each equation, and then find relations.\n\nBut I don't see a straightforward way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that from Equations (1b), (2b), (3b), S is expressed in terms of a, b, c.\n\nSo, S can be written as:\n\n\\( S = a + (8u +4v)/a = b + (9u +6v)/b = c + (5u +10v)/c \\)\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me denote \\( S_a = a + (8u +4v)/a \\)\n\\( S_b = b + (9u +6v)/b \\)\n\\( S_c = c + (5u +10v)/c \\)\n\nAnd since \\( S_a = S_b = S_c = S \\), I can set them equal:\n\n\\( a + (8u +4v)/a = b + (9u +6v)/b \\)\nAnd\n\\( b + (9u +6v)/b = c + (5u +10v)/c \\)\n\nSo, two equations.\n\nLet me take the first one:\n\n\\( a + (8u +4v)/a = b + (9u +6v)/b \\)\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n\\( a - b = (9u +6v)/b - (8u +4v)/a \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( a b \\):\n\n\\( a^2 b - a b^2 = (9u +6v) a - (8u +4v) b \\)\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n\\( a^2 b - a b^2 -9u a -6v a +8u b +4v b =0 \\)\n\nFactor terms:\n\n\\( a b (a - b) -a (9u +6v ) + b (8u +4v ) =0 \\)\n\nHmm, same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor this as:\n\n\\( (a - b)(a b + something ) =0 \\)\n\nBut not directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor:\n\nLet me factor \\( (a - b) \\) out:\n\n\\( (a - b)(a b ) -a (9u +6v ) + b (8u +4v ) =0 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( (a - b)(a b ) = a (9u +6v ) - b (8u +4v ) \\)\n\nHmm, perhaps divide both sides by (a - b), assuming \\( a \\neq b \\):\n\n\\( a b = [a (9u +6v ) - b (8u +4v ) ] / (a - b ) \\)\n\nBut this seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this equation in terms of \\( a/b \\) or \\( b/a \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( k = a/b \\), so \\( a =k b \\)\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n\\( (k b)^2 b - (k b) b^2 -9u (k b ) -6v (k b ) +8u b +4v b =0 \\)\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n\\( k^2 b^3 -k b^3 -9u k b -6v k b +8u b +4v b =0 \\)\n\nFactor out b:\n\n\\( b [k^2 b^2 -k b^2 -9u k -6v k +8u +4v ] =0 \\)\n\nSince b is positive, \\( b \\neq0 \\), so:\n\n\\( k^2 b^2 -k b^2 -9u k -6v k +8u +4v =0 \\)\n\nHmm, perhaps factor terms with b^2 and terms with k:\n\n\\( b^2 (k^2 -k ) -k (9u +6v ) + (8u +4v ) =0 \\)\n\nBut this is a quadratic in b^2, which is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can solve for b^2:\n\n\\( b^2 (k^2 -k ) = k (9u +6v ) - (8u +4v ) \\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\( b^2 = [k (9u +6v ) - (8u +4v ) ] / (k^2 -k ) \\)\n\nBut this is getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider specific values for u and v.\n\nGiven that \\( u = \\ln 2 \\approx 0.6931 \\), \\( v = \\ln 3 \\approx 1.0986 \\)\n\nSo, compute the constants:\n\nCompute \\( 8u +4v =8*0.6931 +4*1.0986 =5.5448 +4.3944=9.9392 \\)\nCompute \\( 9u +6v =9*0.6931 +6*1.0986=6.2379 +6.5916=12.8295 \\)\nCompute \\(5u +10v=5*0.6931 +10*1.0986=3.4655 +10.986=14.4515 \\)\n\nSo, Equations (1b), (2b), (3b):\n\n1. \\( a + 9.9392/a = S \\)\n2. \\( b +12.8295/b = S \\)\n3. \\( c +14.4515/c = S \\)\n\nSo, each variable plus a constant over itself equals S.\n\nThis suggests that each variable is a solution to \\( x + K/x = S \\), with different K.\n\nNow, perhaps I can assume that S is the same for all, and try to find a, b, c numerically.\n\nBut since the problem asks for an exact value, perhaps it's better to think of another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the minimal value of \\( xyz \\) corresponds to the product \\( 2^{something} \\cdot 3^{something} \\). Since the RHS of the original equations are products of powers of 2 and 3, perhaps xyz will be a product of powers of 2 and 3.\n\nWait, given that in the original problem, each equation's RHS is a product of powers of 2 and 3, perhaps x, y, z can be expressed as powers of 2 and 3 as well.\n\nLet me assume that \\( x = 2^{p} 3^{q} \\), \\( y =2^{r} 3^{s} \\), \\( z =2^{t} 3^{u} \\), where p, q, r, s, t, u are real numbers.\n\nThen, let me substitute into the original equations.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n\\( x^{\\log_2(y z)} =2^8 \\cdot3^4 \\)\n\nCompute \\( y z =2^{r + t} 3^{s + u} \\). So, \\( \\log_2(y z )= \\log_2(2^{r + t} 3^{s + u})= (r + t ) + (s + u ) \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nLet me denote \\( d = \\log_2 3 \\), so \\( \\log_2(y z )= r + t + d (s + u ) \\)\n\nThen, the left side is \\( x^{\\log_2(y z)} = (2^{p} 3^{q})^{r + t + d (s + u ) }=2^{p (r + t + d (s + u ))} 3^{q (r + t + d (s + u ))} \\)\n\nThis equals \\(2^8 \\cdot 3^4 \\). So, equating exponents:\n\nFor 2: \\( p (r + t + d (s + u )) =8 \\) \u2014 Equation (A)\nFor 3: \\( q (r + t + d (s + u )) =4 \\) \u2014 Equation (B)\n\nSimilarly, second equation:\n\n\\( y^{\\log_2(z x)} =2^9 \\cdot3^6 \\)\n\nCompute \\( z x =2^{t + p}3^{u + q} \\). So, \\( \\log_2(z x )= t + p + d (u + q ) \\)\n\nLeft side: \\( y^{\\log_2(z x )}= (2^{r}3^{s})^{t + p + d (u + q ) }=2^{r (t + p + d (u + q ))}3^{s (t + p + d (u + q ))} \\)\n\nThis equals \\(2^9 \\cdot3^6 \\). So:\n\nFor 2: \\( r (t + p + d (u + q )) =9 \\) \u2014 Equation (C)\nFor 3: \\( s (t + p + d (u + q )) =6 \\) \u2014 Equation (D)\n\nThird equation:\n\n\\( z^{\\log_2(x y)}=2^5 \\cdot3^{10} \\)\n\nCompute \\( x y =2^{p + r}3^{q + s} \\). So, \\( \\log_2(x y )= p + r + d (q + s ) \\)\n\nLeft side: \\( z^{\\log_2(x y )}= (2^{t}3^{u})^{p + r + d (q + s ) }=2^{t (p + r + d (q + s ))}3^{u (p + r + d (q + s ))} \\)\n\nThis equals \\(2^5 \\cdot3^{10} \\).

So, likely S can be expressed in terms of u, v, w.\n\nFrom Equations (1), (2), (3), we can express S as:\n\nFrom (1): S\u2248(14.35 +u^2 ) /u\n\nFrom (2): S\u2248(18.53 +v^2 ) /v\n\nFrom (3): S\u2248(20.89 +w^2 ) /w\n\nThus,\n\n(14.35 +u^2 ) /u = (18.53 +v^2 ) /v = (20.89 +w^2 ) /w = S\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me set S = (14.35 +u^2 ) /u = (18.53 +v^2 ) /v = (20.89 +w^2 ) /w\n\nLet me solve for u, v, w.\n\nLet me first solve for u:\n\nLet me denote f(x ) = (C +x^2 ) /x =x + C /x\n\nWe need to find x such that f(x )=S, for given constants C.\n\nFor equation (1): f(u )=14.35 /u +u =S\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut since S is the same, perhaps u, v, w are different roots of the same equation.\n\nWait, for a given S, the equation x + C /x =S can have two solutions.\n\nBut perhaps u, v, w are the three different roots of these equations.\n\nBut this is getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that u, v, w are in a geometric progression or something.\n\nBut since I'm stuck, perhaps I can use the approximate values I found earlier.\n\nFrom earlier, I had:\n\nu\u22481.11, v\u22480.555, w\u22480.9635\n\nBut S= u +v +w\u22481.11 +0.555 +0.9635\u22482.6285\n\nBut compute Equation (1): (v +w )u\u2248(0.555 +0.9635 )*1.11\u22481.5185 *1.11\u22481.686\u224814.35? No, way off.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So my earlier approach was flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier when substituting variables.\n\nWait, in the substitution, I set x=2^p 3^q, etc., but perhaps I should have set x=2^{a} 3^{b}, where a and b are the exponents in log_2 x =A, log_2 y =B, log_2 z =C.\n\nWait, no, I think I confused the substitution.\n\nWait, going back, when I set x=2^p 3^q, then log_2 x =p + q log_2 3.\n\nBut perhaps that's a better substitution.\n\nWait, let me try this again.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me set x=2^{p} 3^{q}, y=2^{r} 3^{s}, z=2^{t} 3^{u}\n\nThen, log_2 x =p + q log_2 3 =p + q d\n\nSimilarly,\n\nlog_2 y =r + s d\n\nlog_2 z =t + u d\n\nThen, the original equations:\n\n1. \\(x^{\\log_2(y z )}=2^8 3^4\\)\nCompute log_2(y z )=log_2 y + log_2 z = (r + s d ) + (t +u d )=r + t +d (s +u )\n\nThus, x^{log_2(y z )}= [2^{p} 3^{q}]^{r + t +d (s +u ) }=2^{p (r + t +d (s +u ))} 3^{q (r + t +d (s +u ))}=2^8 3^4\n\nThus,\n\np (r + t +d (s +u ))=8 \u2014 Equation (A)\nq (r + t +d (s +u ))=4 \u2014 Equation (B)\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation:\n\n2. \\(y^{\\log_2(z x )}=2^9 3^6\\)\n\nCompute log_2(z x )=log_2 z + log_2 x = (t +u d ) + (p + q d )=t +p +d (u + q )\n\nThus, y^{log_2(z x )}= [2^{r}3^{s}]^{t +p +d (u + q ) }=2^{r (t +p +d (u + q ))}3^{s (t +p +d (u + q ))}=2^9 3^6\n\nThus,\n\nr (t +p +d (u + q ))=9 \u2014 Equation (C)\ns (t +p +d (u + q ))=6 \u2014 Equation (D)\n\nThird equation:\n\n3. \\(z^{\\log_2(x y )}=2^5 3^{10}\\)\n\nCompute log_2(x y )=log_2 x + log_2 y = (p + q d ) + (r + s d )=p + r +d (q + s )\n\nThus, z^{log_2(x y )}= [2^{t}3^{u}]^{p + r +d (q + s ) }=2^{t (p + r +d (q + s ))}3^{u (p + r +d (q + s ))}=2^5 3^{10}\n\nThus,\n\nt (p + r +d (q + s ))=5 \u2014 Equation (E)\nu (p + r +d (q + s ))=10 \u2014 Equation (F)\n\nSo, same as before.\n\nEarlier, I tried to solve this system and found approximate values, but the product xyz came out to be around 540, which contradicts the result from multiplying all three equations, which suggested xyz\u224817.7.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that I made an error in my approach.\n\nWait, the step where I multiplied all three equations:\n\nLeft side: x^{log(yz)} y^{log(zx)} z^{log(xy)} = (x y z )^{2 log(x y z ) }\n\nBut wait, let me verify:\n\nlog(yz ) + log(zx ) + log(xy )= log y + log z + log z + log x + log x + log y =2 log x +2 log y +2 log z=2 log(x y z )\n\nBut this is in natural logs? Or base 2?\n\nWait, in the step above, I think I confused the base.\n\nWait, actually, when I wrote log(yz ), it's base 2, because in the original substitution, the exponent is log_2(yz ).\n\nSo, let me clarify:\n\nLeft side: x^{log_2(yz)} y^{log_2(zx)} z^{log_2(xy)}\n\nLet me write each term as exponentials with base 2:\n\nx^{log_2(yz)}=2^{log_2 x * log_2(yz)}\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to take log base 2 of both sides.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nlog_2 (Left side )= log_2(x^{log_2(yz)} y^{log_2(zx)} z^{log_2(xy)} )\n\n= log_2(yz ) * log_2 x + log_2(zx ) * log_2 y + log_2(xy ) * log_2 z\n\nWhich is:\n\n(log_2 y + log_2 z ) log_2 x + (log_2 z + log_2 x ) log_2 y + (log_2 x + log_2 y ) log_2 z\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nlog_2 x log_2 y + log_2 x log_2 z + log_2 y log_2 z + log_2 y log_2 z + log_2 z log_2 x + log_2 z log_2 x\n\nWait, no, expanding:\n\n= log_2 x log_2 y + log_2 x log_2 z + log_2 y log_2 z + log_2 y log_2 z + log_2 z log_2 x + log_2 z log_2 x\n\nWait, that's:\n\n= 2 log_2 x log_2 y + 2 log_2 y log_2 z + 2 log_2 z log_2 x\n\nThus,\n\nlog_2 (Left side )=2 (log_2 x log_2 y + log_2 y log_2 z + log_2 z log_2 x )\n\nRight side: log_2 (2^{22} 3^{20})=22 log_2 2 +20 log_2 3=22 +20 log_2 3\n\nThus,\n\n2 (log_2 x log_2 y + log_2 y log_2 z + log_2 z log_2 x )=22 +20 log_2 3\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nlog_2 x log_2 y + log_2 y log_2 z + log_2 z log_2 x =11 +10 log_2 3 \u2014 Equation (M)\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me set a=log_2 x, b=log_2 y, c=log_2 z\n\nThen, Equation (M):\n\nab + bc + ca=11 +10 log_2 3\u224811 +10*1.58496\u224811 +15.8496\u224826.8496\n\nBut from Equations (1), (2), (3):\n\nEquation (1): a(b +c )=8 +4 log_2 3\u22488 +4*1.58496\u22488 +6.3398\u224814.3398\nEquation (2): b(a +c )=9 +6 log_2 3\u22489 +6*1.58496\u22489 +9.5098\u224818.5098\nEquation (3): c(a +b )=5 +10 log_2 3\u22485 +10*1.58496\u22485 +15.8496\u224820.8496\n\nSo, now, we have:\n\n1. a(b +c )\u224814.3398\n2. b(a +c )\u224818.5098\n3. c(a +b )\u224820.8496\n4. ab + bc + ca\u224826.8496\n\nLet me write these as:\n\nEquation (1): a(b +c )=14.3398\nEquation (2): b(a +c )=18.5098\nEquation (3): c(a +b )=20.8496\nEquation (4): ab +bc +ca=26.8496\n\nLet me denote S=a +b +c\n\nThen,\n\nFrom Equation (1): a(S -a )=14.3398\nFrom Equation (2): b(S -b )=18.5098\nFrom Equation (3): c(S -c )=20.8496\n\nAnd Equation (4): ab + bc +ca=26.8496\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me write Equations (1), (2), (3) as:\n\na^2 -S a +14.3398=0 \u2014 Equation (1p)\nb^2 -S b +18.5098=0 \u2014 Equation (2p)\nc^2 -S c +20.8496=0 \u2014 Equation (3p)\n\nSo, each of a, b, c is a root of their respective quadratic equations.\n\nBut since S is the same for all, perhaps the sum of roots of each quadratic is S.\n\nBut each quadratic has two roots, but a, b, c are just one root each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that:\n\nFrom Equation (1p): a + another root =S\n\nSimilarly, from Equation (2p): b + another root =S\n\nFrom Equation (3p): c + another root =S\n\nBut this might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can solve for S.\n\nLet me denote from Equation (1p): a^2 -S a +14.3398=0 \u21d2a=(S \u00b1sqrt(S^2 -4*14.3398 ))/2\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nBut this might not lead anywhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that:\n\nFrom Equation (1): a (S -a )=14.3398\u21d2a S -a^2=14.3398\n\nSimilarly,\n\nFrom Equation (2): b S -b^2=18.5098\n\nFrom Equation (3): c S -c^2=20.8496\n\nLet me subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):\n\nb S -b^2 -a S +a^2=18.5098 -14.3398=4.17\n\nFactor:\n\nS(b -a ) - (b^2 -a^2 )=4.17\n\nWhich is:\n\nS(b -a ) - (b -a )(b +a )=4.17\n\nFactor (b -a ):\n\n(b -a )(S - (a +b ))=4.17\n\nBut S =a +b +c, so S - (a +b )=c\n\nThus,\n\n(b -a ) c=4.17 \u2014 Equation (5)\n\nSimilarly, subtract Equation (2) from Equation (3):\n\nc S -c^2 -b S +b^2=20.8496 -18.5098=2.3398\n\nFactor:\n\nS(c -b ) - (c^2 -b^2 )=2.3398\n\nWhich is:\n\nS(c -b ) - (c -b )(c +b )=2.3398\n\nFactor (c -b ):\n\n(c -b )(S - (b +c ))=2.3398\n\nBut S - (b +c )=a\n\nThus,\n\n(c -b ) a=2.3398 \u2014 Equation (6)\n\nSimilarly, subtract Equation (1) from Equation (3):\n\nc S -c^2 -a S +a^2=20.8496 -14.3398=6.5098\n\nFactor:\n\nS(c -a ) - (c^2 -a^2 )=6.5098\n\nWhich is:\n\nS(c -a ) - (c -a )(c +a )=6.5098\n\nFactor (c -a ):\n\n(c -a )(S - (a +c ))=6.5098\n\nBut S - (a +c )=b\n\nThus,\n\n(c -a ) b=6.5098 \u2014 Equation (7)\n\nNow, we have Equations (5), (6), (7):\n\n5.

But since my approximation is around 550, perhaps it's 600.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the RHS are 2^8 3^4, 2^9 3^6, 2^5 3^{10}.\n\nMultiplying all three equations, the RHS is 2^{22} 3^{20}, as before.\n\nBut the left side is x^{log(yz)} y^{log(zx)} z^{log(xy)}.\n\nBut I cannot find a way to express this in terms of xyz.\n\nThus, given the complexity, perhaps the minimal xyz is 600.\n\nBut since my approximate calculation gives around 550, and the exact value likely requires solving the system, which is complex, perhaps the answer is 600.\n\nWait, but another approach: Given that the equations resemble a system where xyz is to be minimized, perhaps using AM-GM inequality.\n\nBut I don't see a straightforward way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the minimal xyz is achieved when the variables are proportional to certain exponents.\n\nBut without more information, perhaps I can conclude that the minimal xyz is 600.\n\nWait, but earlier, with approximate values, I got xyz\u2248550, which is close to 600, but more precisely around 550.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal value is 600, as a nice number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal xyz is 2^{8} 3^{6}=256*729=186,624, but that's too big.\n\nWait, no, that's the RHS of the second equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal xyz is 2^{something} 3^{something}.\n\nBut in any case, based on the approximate solution, the minimal xyz is around 550, but given the problem's nature, likely an integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal xyz is 60",
