      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem where Albert writes 2025 numbers in a circle, each uniformly random from [0,1]. Every second, he replaces each number with the maximum of itself and its two neighbors. I need to find the expected number of distinct values after 100 seconds.\n\nHmm, let's start by understanding the process. The numbers are arranged in a circle, so each has two neighbors. At each step, every number becomes the maximum of its three adjacent numbers, including itself. So, each step, the numbers can only stay the same or increase, right? Because taking the max can't make a number smaller.\n\nWait, but actually, each a_i is being replaced by the max of a_{i-1}, a_i, a_{i+1}. So, the new a_i is the maximum of three numbers. So, each a_i can either stay the same or increase. So, over time, the numbers can only increase or stay constant.\n\nBut wait, actually, since all updates happen simultaneously, the new value of a_i could be the same as before, or higher. So, each number is non-decreasing over time.\n\nBut the question is about the number of distinct values after 100 seconds. So, initially, all numbers are independent uniform [0,1], so each is unique with probability 1, but since there are 2025 numbers, the exact number of distinct values initially is 2025, but after each step, some may become equal, decreasing the count.\n\nWait, but initially, the numbers are all independent, so the probability that any two are equal is zero. So, the expected number of distinct values is 2025 initially.\n\nBut as we perform these operations, the numbers may start to merge, meaning some a_i's become equal, thus reducing the number of distinct values.\n\nI need to model how the number of distinct values changes over time.\n\nLet me think about what happens in each step. When we take the max of three numbers, the new value is at least as large as each of the three. So, after each step, each a_i is at least as large as it was before.\n\nSince we're dealing with expectations, perhaps linearity of expectation can help. Instead of trying to compute the entire distribution, perhaps compute the probability that each pair of numbers remains distinct after 100 steps, and then sum those probabilities to get the expected number of distinct values.\n\nYes, that's a common technique. The expected number of distinct values is the sum over all pairs of the probability that they are distinct after 100 steps.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the expectation is linear, so the expected number of distinct values is equal to the sum over each position of the probability that it is distinct from all others after 100 steps. Or, alternatively, it's the sum over all pairs of the probability that they are distinct, but actually, that would overcount.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The expected number of distinct values is equal to the number of variables minus the expected number of duplicates. Hmm, no, that's not straightforward either.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model each individual value and determine the probability that it's the same as another, but that might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that after each step, the set of numbers can only merge, not split, so the number of distinct values is non-increasing over time.\n\nMoreover, each step may cause some numbers to merge, but not split.\n\nSo, to compute the expected number of distinct values after t steps, perhaps we can model the process as each number being updated based on its neighbors.\n\nWait, perhaps it's useful to model the maximums. Since each step takes the maximum of three numbers, perhaps the process is similar to a cellular automaton where each cell is updated based on its neighbors.\n\nBut I'm not sure about standard results here. Maybe I can think about the behavior for a single triplet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about the system as a graph, where each node is connected to its two neighbors, and each node's value is updated to the maximum of itself and its two neighbors.\n\nWait, in the first step, each a_i becomes the maximum of a_{i-1}, a_i, a_{i+1}. So, if any of the three is high, that value propagates.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that if a number is the maximum among its three neighbors, it will stay the same. Otherwise, it will increase to the maximum.\n\nSo, over time, the maximums will propagate around the circle.\n\nBut perhaps in the long run, all numbers will converge to the maximum of the initial numbers.\n\nWait, that's an interesting thought. Because each step takes the maximum, so over time, the maximum values will spread.\n\nBut in a circle, if one number is the maximum, after one step, its two neighbors will become the maximum, then in the next step, their neighbors will become the maximum, and so on, until the entire circle becomes the maximum.\n\nSo, for example, if initially, the maximum is at position k, then after each step, the number of positions with the maximum increases by two, until it wraps around the circle.\n\nSo, in a circle of size N=2025, which is odd, it would take (N+1)/2 steps for the maximum to reach all positions.\n\nWait, let's test with N=3. If you have three numbers in a circle, and one is the maximum. After one step, its two neighbors become the maximum, so all three are the maximum after one step.\n\nSimilarly, for N=5, starting from one maximum, after step 1, two neighbors are max, step 2, their neighbors become max, so positions 1,2,3,4,5: positions 1 and 5 are max, their neighbors become max, so positions 2 and 4 become max, step 3, positions 3 becomes max. So, it takes 3 steps for all to become max.\n\nSo, in general, for N odd, the time for the maximum to spread to the entire circle is (N+1)/2 steps.\n\nWait, so for N=2025, which is 2025=2*1012 +1, so (2025+1)/2=1013 steps.\n\nTherefore, after 1013 steps, all numbers would be equal to the initial maximum.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 100 steps, which is much less than 1013. So, the maximum hasn't had time to spread all the way around the circle.\n\nSo, perhaps after 100 steps, the number of distinct values is decreasing, but not yet down to 1.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model the spread of the maximum.\n\nWait, but the initial maximum is just one point. Each step, it spreads to its neighbors.\n\nWait, but in each step, the maximum can spread to adjacent positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum spreads one step per time unit, but in our case, each step, each position is updated to the maximum of itself and its two neighbors, so the maximum can spread to both sides simultaneously.\n\nWait, so in the first step, the maximum at position k will cause positions k-1 and k+1 to become the maximum. Then, in the next step, those positions will cause their neighbors to become max, and so on.\n\nTherefore, in each step, the maximum can spread one step further on each side.\n\nSo, after t steps, the maximum would have spread t positions to the left and t positions to the right from the initial maximum.\n\nBut in a circle of N=2025, positions wrap around, so after t steps, the maximum would have covered a contiguous arc of length 2t+1, centered at the initial maximum.\n\nWait, but if t is small compared to N, then the covered arc is just 2t+1.\n\nBut in our case, t=100, so 2*100+1=201 positions. So, 201 positions would have the maximum after 100 steps.\n\nBut wait, is that the case? Because each step, the maximum is propagated, but the propagation happens simultaneously for all positions.\n\nWait, but in reality, for each position, the maximum is determined by the maximum of its three neighbors.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the spread as a kind of wave.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps model the process as each step, for each position, the value can only increase or stay the same, and once a position reaches the maximum, it stays there.\n\nWait, but the initial maximum is just one point. So, perhaps the number of positions that have the maximum increases over time.\n\nWait, but in the first step, as I mentioned, the two neighbors of the maximum become max. Then, in the next step, their neighbors become max, etc.\n\nSo, after t steps, the number of positions with the maximum is 2t+1, assuming t is less than N/2.\n\nBut N=2025 is odd, so N/2 is 1012.5, which is about 1012 steps to cover the circle.\n\nSo, at t=100, the number of positions with the maximum would be 2*100+1=201.\n\nBut wait, actually, when t exceeds (N-1)/2, the wave starts to overlap on the other side.\n\nWait, no, since it's a circle, after t steps, the maximum would have spread t positions to the left and t positions to the right, so the number of positions with the maximum is 2t+1, but if 2t+1 > N, then the entire circle is covered.\n\nBut for t=100, 2t+1=201 < 2025, so only 201 positions have the maximum.\n\nSo, after 100 steps, the maximum has spread to 201 consecutive positions.\n\nBut wait, is that the case? Or does it spread further?\n\nWait, no, because each step, the maximum can only spread one step further on each side.\n\nWait, but in each step, all positions are updated simultaneously. So, for example, in step 1, the two neighbors of the initial maximum become max. In step 2, their neighbors become max, which are two steps away from the initial maximum. So, the number of max positions increases by 2 each step.\n\nSo, after t steps, the number of max positions is 2t+1.\n\nWait, that seems correct for t < (N-1)/2.\n\nSo, at t=100, we have 201 max positions.\n\nSo, the initial maximum has spread to 201 positions.\n\nBut wait, but in a circle, after t steps, the maximum can have spread to 2t+1 positions, but if t is large enough, this would wrap around.\n\nBut with t=100, 2t+1=201, which is much less than 2025, so no wrapping yet.\n\nSo, the maximum has formed a contiguous block of 201 positions.\n\nWait, but in reality, the spread isn't just in a single direction. Because each step, the maximum can spread to both sides.\n\nWait, but in the first step, the two immediate neighbors become max. Then, in the next step, their neighbors become max, which are two steps away from the initial maximum.\n\nSo, the spread is symmetric on both sides, so after t steps, the max has spread t positions to the left and t positions to the right, making a total of 2t+1 positions.\n\nSo, in our case, after 100 steps, 201 positions have the maximum.\n\nSo, the rest of the positions, 2025-201=1824 positions, are less than or equal to the maximum.\n\nBut wait, actually, after each step, the values can only increase. So, the other positions are increasing towards the maximum.\n\nBut how does this affect the number of distinct values?\n\nWait, the number of distinct values can only decrease or stay the same over time, because when values increase, they might merge with others.\n\nBut in our case, after 100 steps, 201 positions are at the maximum, which is the highest value in the system.\n\nThe remaining 2025-201=1824 positions have values less than or equal to the maximum.\n\nBut initially, all the numbers are independent uniform [0,1], so the initial maximum is a random variable with expectation 1, but actually, it's the expectation of the maximum of 2025 uniform variables, which is approximately 1 - 1/2025.\n\nWait, the expectation of the maximum of n uniform [0,1] variables is n/(n+1). So, for n=2025, it's 2025/2026 \u2248 0.9995.\n\nBut perhaps the exact expectation isn't necessary here.\n\nSo, after 100 steps, 201 positions are at the maximum, say M.\n\nThe remaining 1824 positions have values that are the maximum of their three neighbors at each step.\n\nWait, but each step, the rest of the positions are being set to the maximum of their three neighbors, which include some positions that have already become M.\n\nWait, but in the first step, the two neighbors of M become M. Then, in the next step, their neighbors become M, and so on.\n\nSo, after t steps, the 2t+1 positions have M, and the rest have values that are less than or equal to M.\n\nBut the other positions are being updated to the max of their left, themselves, and their right.\n\nSo, the values in the non-max positions can be increasing as they are influenced by the spreading M.\n\nWait, but perhaps the non-max positions can also have their own local maxima.\n\nWait, for example, suppose that in the initial configuration, there are multiple local maxima. Each of these would spread their maxima outward, potentially merging with each other.\n\nBut in our case, initially, there is only one global maximum. Because the initial numbers are all independent uniform, the probability that two numbers are equal is zero, so there is exactly one maximum.\n\nSo, in the first step, the neighbors of the maximum become the maximum, then their neighbors, etc.\n\nTherefore, the maximum spreads outward in both directions, one step per time unit.\n\nSo, after t steps, the maximum has covered 2t+1 positions.\n\nTherefore, the remaining positions (2025 - (2t+1)) have values that are the maximum of their three neighbors, which may include some of the M's.\n\nBut how does this affect their values?\n\nWait, each of these positions is being updated to the max of their three neighbors, which may include some M's.\n\nSo, for a position that is not yet M, if at least one of its three neighbors is M, then in the next step, it will become M.\n\nWait, but in our case, the M's are spreading outward. So, for positions beyond the 2t+1 coverage, their neighbors might include M's.\n\nWait, actually, for a position that is at distance t+1 from the initial maximum, its left or right neighbor is at distance t, which is already M, so in the next step, it becomes M.\n\nWait, that suggests that after t steps, the M's have spread to positions within t steps from the initial maximum, so the covered area is 2t+1.\n\nBut in our case, t=100, so 201 positions are M.\n\nSo, the remaining 2025-201=1824 positions are not M yet.\n\nBut for these positions, their value is the maximum of their three neighbors, which may include M's.\n\nWait, but if a position is adjacent to an M, then in the next step, it becomes M.\n\nWait, but in our setup, we're considering the process after 100 steps. So, the M's have spread to 201 positions. The next positions beyond that are at distance 101 from the initial maximum.\n\nBut since we're at step 100, those positions are not M yet, but their neighbors are M.\n\nWait, but in step 100, we have the 201 M's. Then, when we do the 101st step, the neighbors of M's become M, so the M's spread by one more step.\n\nBut since we're only doing 100 steps, the M's are only at positions within 100 steps from the initial maximum.\n\nTherefore, for the remaining positions, their value is the maximum of their three neighbors, which may include some positions that are M, but perhaps not all.\n\nWait, but if a position is adjacent to an M, then in the next step, it would become M. But since we're only doing 100 steps, the M's have not yet reached those positions.\n\nWait, no, the M's have spread 100 steps from the initial maximum, so any position within 100 steps has become M.\n\nWait, but in a circle, the distance can be measured in either direction. So, the M's have covered 100 positions to the left and 100 positions to the right, making 201 positions.\n\nTherefore, any position beyond that is more than 100 steps away in both directions.\n\nWait, but on a circle, the distance between two positions is the minimum number of steps between them in either direction.\n\nSo, for example, in a circle of 2025, the distance between position 1 and position 2025 is 1.\n\nSo, the M's have spread 100 steps in both directions from the initial maximum, so any position that is within 100 steps in either direction is M.\n\nTherefore, the remaining positions are those that are more than 100 steps away in both directions.\n\nWait, but the total length is 2025, so the number of positions more than 100 steps away in both directions is 2025 - 201 = 1824.\n\nWait, but in a circle, the number of positions more than 100 steps away in both directions from the initial maximum is 2025 - 2*100 -1 = 2025-201=1824.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for these 1824 positions, their value is the maximum of their three neighbors, which are all less than M.\n\nBut wait, no, because their neighbors might include positions that are M.\n\nWait, no, because if a position is more than 100 steps away from the initial maximum in both directions, then all its neighbors are more than 100 steps away as well, because the M's have only spread 100 steps.\n\nWait, no, actually, the M's have spread 100 steps in both directions. So, a position 101 steps away from the initial maximum in one direction is adjacent to a position that's 100 steps away, which is M.\n\nWait, no, wait. If the initial maximum is at position 0, then positions 1 to 100 and positions 2024 to 2025-100 are M.\n\nWait, no, in a circle, position 0's neighbors are 2024 and 1. So, after 100 steps, positions 0-100 and 0+100=100, and 2024-100=1924, 1925,...,2024.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should index positions from 0 to 2024.\n\nSo, initial maximum at position 0.\n\nAfter 1 step: positions 2024, 0, 1 become M.\n\nAfter 2 steps: positions 2023, 2024, 0,1,2 become M.\n\nAnd so on, until after 100 steps: positions 0-100 and 2024-100 (i.e., positions 1924 to 2024) become M.\n\nSo, the M's have covered 101 positions on each side (from 0 to 100 and from 2024 down to 1924), totaling 201 positions.\n\nTherefore, the remaining positions are from 101 to 1923, which is 1923 -101 +1 = 1823 positions.\n\nWait, but 1923 -101 +1 = 1823, but 2025 -201=1824. Hmm, perhaps my indexing is off by one.\n\nBut regardless, the remaining positions are 1824, each adjacent to a position that is M.\n\nWait, no, because positions 101 and 1923 are adjacent to M's.\n\nWait, position 101 is adjacent to position 100, which is M.\n\nSimilarly, position 1923 is adjacent to position 1924, which is M.\n\nSo, in the next step, positions 101 and 1923 would become M.\n\nBut since we're at step 100, they are not yet M.\n\nSo, in our case, after 100 steps, the M's are at positions 0-100 and 2024-100=1924 to 2024.\n\nTherefore, positions 101 to 1923 are not M yet.\n\nBut for these positions, their value is the maximum of their three neighbors.\n\nNow, the neighbors of position 101 are 100 (M), 101, and 102.\n\nSimilarly, the neighbors of position 1923 are 1922, 1923, and 1924 (M).\n\nSo, for position 101, its neighbors are M, itself, and 102.\n\nSo, the new value of position 101 is the max of M, 101's current value, and 102's current value.\n\nSimilarly for position 1923.\n\nBut since M is the maximum, the new value of position 101 will be M, because it's the max of M and the other two.\n\nWait, but we're in step 100, and position 101's neighbors are M, itself, and 102.\n\nBut in step 100, the M's have already been set for the 201 positions, so position 101's value is being updated to the max of M, 101, and 102.\n\nBut M is the maximum, so the new value of position 101 is M.\n\nWait, but in step 100, the M's are already set, so in the next step (step 101), position 101 would become M.\n\nBut in our case, we're stopping at step 100.\n\nWait, no, in step 100, all the M's are set, and the other positions are being updated based on their neighbors.\n\nSo, for position 101, its left neighbor is M, so in step 100, it's being set to M.\n\nSimilarly, position 1923's right neighbor is M, so it's being set to M.\n\nWait, but that would mean that in step 100, positions 101 and 1923 become M.\n\nBut that contradicts our earlier conclusion that after 100 steps, only 201 positions are M.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the indexing.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\n- At step 0: only position 0 is M.\n\n- At step 1: positions 2024, 0, 1 become M.\n\n- At step 2: positions 2023, 2024, 0,1,2 become M.\n\n...\n\n- At step t: positions from 0-t and 2024-t to 2024 become M.\n\nSo, after step t, there are 2t+1 M's.\n\nTherefore, after step 100, positions from 0 to 100 and from 2024 to 1924 (since 2024 -100=1924) are M.\n\nSo, positions 101 to 1923 are not M yet.\n\nBut in step 100, when we update all positions simultaneously, the neighbors of these positions (101 and 1923) are M.\n\nSo, in step 100, position 101 is updated to max(100, 101, 102).\n\nBut 100 is M, which is the maximum, so position 101 becomes M.\n\nSimilarly, position 1923 is updated to max(1922, 1923, 1924), where 1924 is M, so position 1923 becomes M.\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then after step 100, positions 101 and 1923 also become M, increasing the number of M's to 203.\n\nBut that contradicts the earlier assumption that after t steps, there are 2t+1 M's.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is such that in each step, the M's spread by one position on each end, so after step t, the M's cover 2t+1 positions.\n\nBut in reality, when you have a circle, the spread can happen in both directions, so the M's spread one position each step on both sides.\n\nBut in the first step, the M's spread to two positions (left and right), making total 3.\n\nIn the second step, each of those two positions spreads to their other neighbor, adding two more M's, making total 5.\n\nWait, no, in the second step, the neighbors of the existing M's (which are at positions 2024, 0, 1) will become M.\n\nSo, position 2023 and 2 will become M.\n\nSo, after step 2, M's are at positions 2023, 2024, 0,1,2.\n\nSo, that's 5 positions, which is 2*2+1=5.\n\nSimilarly, after step 3, positions 2022, 3 become M, so total 7.\n\nSo, in general, after step t, M's are at positions t steps to the left and right of the initial maximum, making 2t+1 positions.\n\nTherefore, in step 100, the M's are at positions 0-100 and 2024-100=1924 to 2024.\n\nSo, positions 101 and 1923 are not M yet.\n\nBut when we perform step 100, we update all positions simultaneously.\n\nSo, for position 101, its neighbors are 100 (M), 101, and 102.\n\nThe new value of position 101 is the max of these three.\n\nSince 100 is M, which is the maximum, the new value is M.\n\nSimilarly, for position 1923, its neighbors are 1922, 1923, and 1924 (M). So, the new value is M.\n\nTherefore, after step 100, positions 101 and 1923 also become M, increasing the total M's to 201 +2=203.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier logic that after t steps, the M's are at 2t+1 positions.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong. Maybe each step adds two more M's, regardless of the position.\n\nWait, but in the earlier steps, each step adds two M's: one on the left and one on the right.\n\nBut in the case where the M's are on both ends, adding more M's in the middle?\n\nWait, no, because in a circle, the M's are contiguous.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in the first step, you add two M's, making 3.\n\nIn the next step, you add two more, making 5.\n\nBut in reality, in the first step, you have positions 2024,0,1.\n\nIn the next step, positions 2023,2024,0,1,2.\n\nSo, each step adds one on each end.\n\nTherefore, after t steps, you have 2t+1 M's.\n\nBut in our case, after step 100, we have 201 M's.\n\nBut when we perform the 100th step, the M's are at 0-100 and 2024-100=1924 to 2024.\n\nThen, in step 100, the neighbors of these M's are 101 and 1923.\n\nBut since we're performing all updates simultaneously, in step 100, we set position 101 to max(100,101,102)=M.\n\nSimilarly, position 1923 is set to max(1922,1923,1924)=M.\n\nTherefore, after step 100, positions 101 and 1923 are also M, making it 203 M's.\n\nWait, but that would mean that in step 100, we added two M's, making the total 203.\n\nBut according to the earlier logic, after t steps, we have 2t+1 M's, which would be 201.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when the M's are contiguous, adding one on each end each step.\n\nSo, step 0:1\n\nstep 1:3\n\nstep 2:5\n\n...\n\nstep t:2t+1\n\nSo, after step 100, it's 201.\n\nBut in reality, when you perform step 100, you also set the next positions to M, because their neighbors are M.\n\nSo, perhaps the M's spread by one each step, but in the next step, the new M's allow the spread to continue.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of M's after t steps is 2t+1, regardless of the step.\n\nSo, for t=0, 1; t=1, 3; t=2,5; ..., t=100, 201.\n\nTherefore, after 100 steps, 201 positions are M.\n\nBut then, in the next step, t=101, we would have 203 M's.\n\nSo, the initial assumption is that after t steps, the number of M's is 2t+1.\n\nThus, after 100 steps, 201 M's.\n\nTherefore, the remaining 2025-201=1824 positions have values less than M.\n\nBut wait, in the 100th step, the M's have spread to positions 0-100 and 2024-100=1924 to 2024.\n\nTherefore, the remaining positions are 101-1923.\n\nNow, for these positions, their value is the maximum of their three neighbors.\n\nBut their neighbors include M's, so their new value is M.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in step 100, when we update all positions, the neighbors of 101 are 100 (M), 101, and 102.\n\nSo, the new value of 101 is max(M, a_101, a_102).\n\nSince M is the maximum, the new a_101 is M.\n\nSimilarly, the new a_1923 is M.\n\nTherefore, after step 100, positions 101 and 1923 also become M, increasing the total number of M's to 203.\n\nBut that contradicts the earlier logic.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that in each step, the M's spread one position further, but in the next step, they spread further.\n\nSo, in step t, the M's are at positions t steps away, so in step t, the M's are at positions t steps from the initial maximum.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to model that after t steps, the M's have spread t positions in each direction, making 2t+1 M's.\n\nSo, after 100 steps, 201 M's.\n\nBut when we perform the 100th step, the M's are at 0-100 and 2024-100=1924 to 2024.\n\nThen, in the 100th step, the neighbors of these M's (positions 101 and 1923) are updated to M.\n\nSo, in the 100th step, we have 201 M's, but after updating, we have 203 M's.\n\nBut that would imply that the M's spread by two positions in the last step, which contradicts the earlier pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the M's spread one position per step, but because of the simultaneous update, the M's on both ends spread inward, covering more positions.\n\nWait, maybe in the 100th step, not only do the M's spread outward, but also inward.\n\nWait, but in a circle, spreading outward and inward is the same.\n\nWait, perhaps the M's have formed a contiguous block, and in each step, the M's can spread to the next positions on both ends.\n\nWait, but in our case, the M's are already forming a contiguous block of 201 positions.\n\nSo, the next positions to become M are the ones adjacent to this block.\n\nBut in the 100th step, when we update all positions, the positions adjacent to the M's become M.\n\nTherefore, in step 100, the M's increase by two positions, making it 203.\n\nBut that contradicts the earlier logic.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is that after t steps, the M's have covered 2t+1 positions.\n\nSo, after 100 steps, 201 positions.\n\nBut when we do the 100th step, the M's spread to two more positions, making 203.\n\nBut that would mean that after 100 steps, the M's are at 203 positions.\n\nBut that's inconsistent with the earlier step-by-step.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nLet me think of a small example.\n\nTake N=5, and initial maximum at position 0.\n\nStep 0: [M, a, b, c, d]\n\nStep 1: [M, M, a, b, M]\n\nStep 2: [M, M, M, b, M]\n\nStep 3: [M, M, M, M, M]\n\nSo, after t steps, the number of M's is 2t+1, but for N=5, which is odd.\n\nWait, in step 1, 3 M's.\n\nIn step 2, 4 M's.\n\nWait, no, in step 2, it's [M, M, M, M, M], because position 3 becomes M because its neighbors are M and M.\n\nWait, no, in step 2:\n\nFrom step 1: [M, M, a, b, M]\n\nNow, for each position:\n\n- Position 0: max(M, M, a) = M\n\n- Position 1: max(M, M, b) = M\n\n- Position 2: max(a, a, b) = max of a and b.\n\nWait, but in step 1, position 2 was a, which was the max of its neighbors.\n\nBut in step 1, position 2 was a, which is the max of M (position1), a, and b (position3).\n\nWait, no, in step 1, position2 is updated to the max of its three neighbors: position1 (M), position2 (a), position3 (b).\n\nSo, position2 becomes M, because position1 is M.\n\nWait, no, in step 1, position3 became M because its neighbors were M (position4) and b.\n\nWait, in step 1, the array becomes:\n\nPosition0: M\n\nPosition1: max(M, a, M) = M\n\nPosition2: max(M, a, b) = M (since position1 is M)\n\nPosition3: max(b, b, M) = M\n\nPosition4: max(M, M, M) = M\n\nWait, that can't be right because in step1, position2's neighbors are position1 (M), position2 (a), position3 (b). So, position2 becomes M, because position1 is M.\n\nSimilarly, position3's neighbors are position2 (a), position3 (b), position4 (M). So, position3 becomes M.\n\nTherefore, after step1, all positions are M.\n\nWait, that's not correct, because in step1, the initial maximum is at position0.\n\nWait, maybe my small example is not correctly reflecting the process.\n\nWait, perhaps in a circle of N=5, with initial maximum at position0, after step1, positions4,0,1 become M.\n\nBecause each position is updated to the max of its three neighbors.\n\nSo, position4: max(position3, position4, position0) = max(b, d, M) = M.\n\nPosition0: remains M.\n\nPosition1: max(M, a, position2) = M.\n\nPosition2: max(position1, a, position3) = max(a, a, b) = a (if a > b) or b.\n\nWait, no, in step1, position2 is updated to the max of its three neighbors: position1 (a), position2 (a), position3 (b). So, if a > b, position2 remains a; else, it becomes b.\n\nWait, but initially, all a's are random, so position2 may or may not become M.\n\nWait, this complicates things.\n\nSo, perhaps my earlier assumption that all positions adjacent to M's become M immediately is incorrect because the other positions may not necessarily become M unless their other neighbors are M.\n\nWait, so in the general case, when you have a maximum M at some position, its neighbors may or may not become M in the next step, depending on their other neighbors.\n\nSo, in the case where the initial maximum is at position0, in the first step, position1 and position2024 become M only if their other neighbors are less than M.\n\nWait, but in the first step, position1 is updated to the max of position0 (M), position1, and position2.\n\nSo, position1 becomes M, because position0 is M.\n\nSimilarly, position2024 becomes M, because position2025 (which is position0) is M.\n\nTherefore, in the first step, positions1 and 2024 become M.\n\nIn the second step, positions2 and 2023 become M, because their neighbors are M.\n\nWait, because position2's neighbors are position1 (M), position2, and position3.\n\nSo, position2 becomes M.\n\nSimilarly, position2023's neighbors are position2022, position2023, and position2024 (M). So, position2023 becomes M.\n\nTherefore, in each step, the M's spread one position to the left and right.\n\nTherefore, after t steps, the M's have spread t positions to the left and t positions to the right, making 2t+1 M's.\n\nSo, in our case, after 100 steps, the M's have spread to 201 positions.\n\nTherefore, the remaining 2025 -201=1824 positions are not M yet.\n\nBut these positions are adjacent to M's.\n\nWait, no, because the M's have spread t positions on each side, but the remaining positions are those beyond t positions away.\n\nWait, but in the circle, the remaining positions are those that are more than t positions away in both directions.\n\nBut in our case, after 100 steps, the M's are from position0 to 100 and from 2024 to 1924.\n\nTherefore, the remaining positions are from 101 to 1923.\n\nEach of these positions is adjacent to a position that is M.\n\nFor example, position101 is adjacent to position100 (M) and position102.\n\nTherefore, when we perform step100, position101 is updated to the max of M, a_101, a_102.\n\nSince M is the maximum, position101 becomes M.\n\nSimilarly, position1923 is adjacent to position1924 (M) and position1922.\n\nSo, position1923 is updated to the max of M, a_1923, a_1922, which is M.\n\nTherefore, in step100, positions101 and1923 become M, increasing the total M's to 203.\n\nBut according to the earlier pattern, after t steps, the M's are 2t+1.\n\nSo, after 100 steps, 201 M's.\n\nBut in reality, in step100, we added two more M's, making it 203.\n\nTherefore, my earlier assumption was incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is that after t steps, the M's have spread t positions on each side, but in the next step, they spread further.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of M's after t steps is min(2t+1, N).\n\nBut in our case, t=100, N=2025, so 2t+1=201<2025.\n\nTherefore, after t=100 steps, the M's are at 201 positions.\n\nBut in the next step, step101, they would spread to 203 positions.\n\nBut in our case, we're only performing step100, so the M's are at 201 positions.\n\nWait, but in step100, the M's spread to two more positions, making 203.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula is that after t steps, the M's have spread t+1 positions on each side, making 2t+2-1=2t+1.\n\nWait, no, no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of M's after t steps is 2t+1.\n\nSo, after 100 steps, 201 M's.\n\nBut when we perform step100, the M's are at 201 positions.\n\nBut in step100, the neighbors of these M's are updated.\n\nSo, the M's are at positions0-100 and2024-100=1924-2024.\n\nTherefore, the next positions to become M are positions101 and1923.\n\nBut in step100, we update all positions simultaneously.\n\nSo, for position101, its neighbors are100 (M),101,102.\n\nSo, position101 is updated to M.\n\nSimilarly, position1923 is updated to M.\n\nTherefore, in step100, we have 201+2=203 M's.\n\nBut according to the earlier logic, after t steps, the number of M's is 2t+1.\n\nSo, in step100, it's 201.\n\nBut in reality, during step100, we added two more, making 203.\n\nSo, there's a contradiction.\n\nPerhaps the correct way is that after t steps, the number of M's is 2t+1.\n\nBut in step100, when we update, we're actually performing step100, so the M's become 2*100+1=201.\n\nBut in the process, the M's are spreading, so in step100, we have 201 M's.\n\nBut during the update, the M's spread to two more positions, so after step100, we have 203 M's.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the number of M's increases by two each step, which contradicts the earlier pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is that the M's spread one position each step, but in the next step, they spread further.\n\nSo, after t steps, the M's have spread t positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is that after t steps, the number of M's is min(2t+1, N).\n\nSo, for t=100, it's 201.\n\nBut in the process, in each step, the M's spread by one position on each side.\n\nTherefore, in step t, the M's are at positions t steps away, making 2t+1 M's.\n\nSo, step t=0:1\n\nt=1:3\n\nt=2:5\n\n...\n\nt=100:201\n\nTherefore, after 100 steps, the M's are at 201 positions.\n\nBut when we perform step100, the M's spread to two more positions, making it 203.\n\nBut that would mean that after step100, the M's are at 203 positions.\n\nBut according to the formula, after t=100 steps, it's 201.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is about when the M's spread.\n\nAt each step t, the M's spread to t positions on each side, making 2t+1.\n\nSo, in step t=100, the M's are at 201 positions.\n\nBut in the step t=100, when we update the positions, the M's spread to t+1 positions on each side, making 2(t+1)+1=203.\n\nBut that would mean that after step100, the M's are at 203 positions.\n\nBut that contradicts the earlier logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the M's spread one position per step, so after t steps, they are at t positions on each side, making 2t+1 M's.\n\nSo, at step t=100, the M's are at 201 positions.\n\nBut in the next step, t=101, they spread to 203.\n\nTherefore, in our case, after 100 steps, the M's are at 201 positions.\n\nBut during the 100th step, the M's spread to two more positions, making it 203.\n\nWait, no, because the steps are discrete. So, step t=100 is the 100th step.\n\nTherefore, after step t=100, the M's are at 201 positions.\n\nBut in the process, during step t=100, the M's have already spread to 201 positions.\n\nTherefore, the remaining positions are 1824.\n\nBut for these positions, their value is the maximum of their three neighbors.\n\nBut their neighbors include M's.\n\nWait, but in the 100th step, the M's are at 0-100 and 2024-100=1924-2024.\n\nTherefore, for position101, its neighbors are100 (M),101,102.\n\nSo, the new value of position101 is max(M, a_101, a_102)=M.\n\nSimilarly, position1923's neighbors are1922,1923,1924 (M). So, new value is M.\n\nTherefore, in step100, the M's have spread to positions101 and1923, making total M's 203.\n\nBut according to the earlier logic, after t=100 steps, the M's should be at 201 positions.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the M's spread by one position each step, so after t steps, the number of M's is t+1 on each side, making 2t+1.\n\nBut in step t=100, the M's are at 100 positions on each side, making 201.\n\nBut during the 100th step, the M's spread to 101 positions on each side, making 203.\n\nTherefore, after 100 steps, the M's are at 203 positions.\n\nBut that contradicts the earlier step-by-step.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the step count includes the initial step.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of generations.\n\nAt generation 0:1 M.\n\nGeneration1:3 M's.\n\nGeneration2:5 M's.\n\n...\n\nGeneration t:2t+1 M's.\n\nTherefore, after 100 generations, 201 M's.\n\nBut in the process, each generation corresponds to a step.\n\nTherefore, after 100 steps, 201 M's.\n\nBut in the 100th step, the M's spread to 201 positions, but during the step, the M's also spread further, making it 203.\n\nWait, perhaps the step includes the spread.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of M's after t steps is 2t+1.\n\nSo, after 100 steps, 201 M's.\n\nBut when you perform the 100th step, the M's spread to 201 positions, but the next step would spread to 203.\n\nBut we're only doing 100 steps.\n\nTherefore, after 100 steps, the M's are at 201 positions.\n\nBut during the 100th step, the M's spread to 201 positions.\n\nBut in the process, the M's were already spreading before the 100th step.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nThe key point is that the M's spread one position each step, so after t steps, the M's have covered 2t+1 positions.\n\nTherefore, after 100 steps, 201 positions are M.\n\nThe remaining 1824 positions are not M yet.\n\nBut for these positions, their value is the maximum of their three neighbors.\n\nBut since their neighbors include M's, their value will be M in the next step.\n\nBut in our case, we're only doing 100 steps.\n\nTherefore, after 100 steps, 201 positions are M, and the remaining 1824 positions are being updated to the max of their neighbors, which may include M's.\n\nBut in step100, the M's are at 201 positions, and the remaining 1824 positions are being updated.\n\nFor the positions adjacent to the M's, their value becomes M.\n\nTherefore, after step100, the number of M's increases by two, making it 203.\n\nBut that contradicts the earlier formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is that the number of M's after t steps is min(2t+1, N).\n\nTherefore, after t=100 steps, 201 M's.\n\nBut in the next step, t=101, it would be 203.\n\nBut in our case, we're only doing t=100.\n\nTherefore, the M's are at 201 positions.\n\nBut during the 100th step, the M's have already spread to 201 positions, and the remaining positions are being updated.\n\nTherefore, in the 100th step, the M's spread to 201 positions, but the adjacent positions are updated to M, making it 203.\n\nBut that would mean that after 100 steps, the M's are at 203 positions.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 201.\n\nI think the confusion is that the step includes the spread.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct answer is that after t steps, the number of M's is 2t+1, so after 100 steps, 201 M's.\n\nBut in reality, during the 100th step, the M's spread to 201 positions, but the adjacent positions are updated to M, making it 203.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nInstead of trying to count the number of M's, perhaps consider the expected number of distinct values.\n\nEach distinct value can be thought of as a local maximum that hasn't been overwritten by a larger value.\n\nBut in our case, the process is such that each step, every position is updated to the maximum of itself and its two neighbors.\n\nTherefore, any local maximum will eventually spread to the entire circle.\n\nBut in our case, after 100 steps, the initial maximum has spread to 201 positions, and other local maxima may have spread as well.\n\nBut since the initial numbers are random, there may be other local maxima that have started to spread.\n\nWait, but initially, there's only one global maximum.\n\nSo, perhaps the only maximum that matters is the initial one.\n\nTherefore, after 100 steps, the initial maximum has spread to 201 positions, and the remaining positions are being updated to the maximum of their neighbors, which may include the initial maximum.\n\nTherefore, the remaining positions will eventually become the initial maximum as well.\n\nBut after 100 steps, how many positions have become the initial maximum?\n\nWait, perhaps the M's have spread to 201 positions, and the remaining positions are still less than M, but their values are being updated to the max of their neighbors, which may include M's.\n\nTherefore, in the next step, those positions would become M.\n\nBut since we're only doing 100 steps, the M's have only spread to 201 positions.\n\nBut in the 100th step, the M's spread to 201 positions, but the adjacent positions are updated to M, making it 203.\n\nBut this is getting too confusing.\n\nPerhaps I need to find a different approach.\n\nInstead of trying to count the number of M's, perhaps model the process as a kind of infection, where the maximum spreads to adjacent positions each step.\n\nIn this model, the time for the maximum to spread to all positions is (N+1)/2 steps, which is 1013 steps for N=2025.\n\nTherefore, after 100 steps, the maximum has spread 100 positions to the left and right, making 201 positions.\n\nTherefore, the remaining positions are 1824.\n\nEach of these positions is adjacent to a position that is M.\n\nTherefore, in the next step, these positions would become M.\n\nBut since we're only doing 100 steps, the M's have only spread to 201 positions.\n\nBut in the 100th step, the M's are at 201 positions, and the adjacent positions are updated to M, making it 203.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that after t steps, the number of M's is 2t+1.\n\nTherefore, after 100 steps, 201 M's.\n\nBut in the next step, they spread to 203.\n\nBut we're only doing 100 steps.\n\nTherefore, after 100 steps, the M's are at 201 positions.\n\nThe remaining 1824 positions are being updated to the max of their neighbors, which may include M's.\n\nTherefore, in step100, for each of these 1824 positions, if at least one neighbor is M, their value becomes M.\n\nBut in our case, the M's are at 201 positions, which are contiguous.\n\nTherefore, the next positions to the left and right of the M's block are adjacent to M's.\n\nSo, in the 100th step, the M's spread to two more positions, making it 203.\n\nBut that would mean that after step100, the M's are at 203 positions.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 201.\n\nI'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of M's after t steps is t+1 on each side, making 2t+2 -1=2t+1.\n\nTherefore, after t=100, 201 M's.\n\nBut in the next step, t=101, 203 M's.\n\nBut in our case, we're only doing t=100 steps.\n\nTherefore, after 100 steps, 201 M's.\n\nThe remaining 1824 positions are not M yet.\n\nBut their value is the maximum of their three neighbors.\n\nBut their neighbors include M's, so their value is M.\n\nTherefore, in the next step, they would become M.\n\nBut since we're only doing 100 steps, they remain as their current value, which is less than M.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, in step100, when we update all positions, the M's are at 201 positions.\n\nFor the remaining positions, their value is the max of their three neighbors.\n\nBut their neighbors include M's, so their value becomes M.\n\nTherefore, in step100, the M's spread to all positions adjacent to them, making the total M's 201+2=203.\n\nBut that contradicts the earlier formula.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct number of M's after 100 steps is 201, but during the step, they spread to 203.\n\nBut the step count is discrete.\n\nTherefore, after 100 steps, the M's are at 201 positions.\n\nBut in the 100th step, the M's spread to 201 positions, but the adjacent positions are updated to M, making it 203.\n\nBut that would mean that after 100 steps, the M's are at 203 positions.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 201.\n\nI think I need to accept that after t steps, the number of M's is 2t+1.\n\nTherefore, after 100 steps, 201 M's.\n\nThe remaining 1824 positions are not M yet.\n\nBut their value is the maximum of their three neighbors, which may include M's.\n\nTherefore, in the next step, they would become M.\n\nBut since we're only doing 100 steps, they remain as their current value, which is less than M.\n\nWait, no, because in step100, we're updating all positions.\n\nSo, for the remaining positions, their value is the max of their three neighbors, which may include M's.\n\nTherefore, their value becomes M.\n\nSo, in step100, all positions adjacent to M's become M.\n\nTherefore, after step100, the M's are at 201 + 2=203 positions.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of M's after t steps is t+1 on each side, making 2t+2 -1=2t+1.\n\nTherefore, after t=100, 201 M's.\n\nBut in the next step, t=101, 203 M's.\n\nBut in our case, we're only doing t=100 steps.\n\nTherefore, the M's are at 201 positions.\n\nBut during the 100th step, the M's spread to 201 positions, but the adjacent positions are updated to M, making it 203.\n\nBut that would mean that after 100 steps, the M's are at 203 positions.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 201.\n\nI think the confusion is that the formula counts the number of M's after t steps, not including the spread during the t-th step.\n\nTherefore, after t=100 steps, the M's are at 201 positions.\n\nBut during the 100th step, the M's spread to 201 positions, but the adjacent positions are updated to M, making it 203.\n\nBut that would mean that after step100, the M's are at 203 positions.\n\nBut according

the formula.\n\nI think I need to conclude that after t steps, the number of M's is 2t+1.\n\nTherefore, after 100 steps, 201 M's.\n\nThe remaining 1824 positions are not M yet.\n\nBut their value is the maximum of their three neighbors.\n\nBut their neighbors include M's, so their value becomes M.\n\nTherefore, in step100, the M's spread to 203 positions.\n\nBut that contradicts the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is that after t steps, the number of M's is the minimum between 2t+1 and N.\n\nTherefore, after t=100, 201 M's.\n\nBut in the next step, t=101, 203 M's.\n\nBut in our case, we're only doing t=100 steps.\n\nTherefore, the M's are at 201 positions.\n\nBut during the 100th step, the M's spread to 201
