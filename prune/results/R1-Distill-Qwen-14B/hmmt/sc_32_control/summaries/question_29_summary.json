      "full_content": "Alright, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand everything.\n\nWe have a rectangle ABCD with BC = 24. So, since it's a rectangle, BC is one of the sides, and since BC is 24, AB must be the other side, which is the one we're supposed to find. Point X is inside the rectangle, and angle AXB is 90 degrees. Also, both triangles AXD and BXC are acute and have circumradii 13 and 15, respectively. Our goal is to compute AB.\n\nHmm. Okay, let me visualize the rectangle. Let's label the rectangle with A at the bottom-left corner, B at the bottom-right, C at the top-right, and D at the top-left. So, AB and CD are the lengths we're trying to find, and BC and AD are the widths, which are given as 24.\n\nPoint X is inside the rectangle, and angle AXB is 90 degrees. That means that X lies on the circle with diameter AB, right? Because in a circle, any triangle inscribed with the diameter as one side is a right triangle. So, the set of all points X such that angle AXB is 90 degrees lies on the circle with AB as diameter.\n\nBut X is also inside the rectangle, so the circle must intersect the rectangle at point X. Interesting.\n\nNow, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute and have circumradii 13 and 15, respectively. So, for triangle AXD, the circumradius is 13, and for triangle BXC, it's 15.\n\nI remember that the circumradius R of a triangle with sides a, b, c is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where \u0394 is the area of the triangle. But since both triangles are acute, maybe there's another property we can use. For an acute triangle, the circumradius is related to the sides, but I'm not sure exactly how.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the formula for the circumradius in terms of the sides and the angles. For any triangle, R = a/(2*sin A) = b/(2*sin B) = c/(2*sin C). Since the triangles are acute, their angles are all less than 90 degrees, so the sines will be positive and less than 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Let me assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let's set point A at (0, 0), so B would be at (AB, 0), C at (AB, BC) which is (AB, 24), and D at (0, 24). Then, point X is somewhere inside the rectangle, so its coordinates are (x, y), where 0 < x < AB and 0 < y < 24.\n\nGiven that angle AXB is 90 degrees, so the vectors AX and BX are perpendicular. So, the dot product of vectors AX and BX should be zero.\n\nVectors AX and BX can be represented as (x, y) and (x - AB, y), respectively. Their dot product is x*(x - AB) + y*y = 0.\n\nSo, x(x - AB) + y^2 = 0. Let's write that as equation (1): x^2 - AB*x + y^2 = 0.\n\nNow, let's consider triangles AXD and BXC.\n\nFirst, triangle AXD. Its vertices are A(0,0), X(x,y), and D(0,24). Let's find the lengths of its sides.\n\nAD is from A to D, which is 24 units. AX is from A to X: sqrt(x^2 + y^2). XD is from X to D: sqrt((x - 0)^2 + (y - 24)^2) = sqrt(x^2 + (y - 24)^2).\n\nSimilarly, triangle BXC has vertices B(AB, 0), X(x,y), and C(AB,24). The sides are BC which is 24, BX which is sqrt((x - AB)^2 + y^2), and XC which is sqrt((x - AB)^2 + (y - 24)^2).\n\nGiven that both triangles are acute, which might help in constraining the position of X, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nNow, let's think about the circumradius of triangle AXD being 13. Let's denote R1 = 13 and R2 = 15 for triangles AXD and BXC, respectively.\n\nThe formula for the circumradius of a triangle is R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where a, b, c are the sides, and \u0394 is the area. Alternatively, using the formula R = a/(2*sin A), where A is the angle opposite side a.\n\nAlternatively, for coordinate geometry, maybe we can find the circumradius in terms of coordinates.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in a triangle, if I know the coordinates of the three points, I can compute the circumradius.\n\nSo, for triangle AXD, with points A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24). Let's compute the circumradius.\n\nI know that the circumradius can be found using the formula:\n\nR = \\frac{abc}{4\u0394}\n\nWhere a, b, c are the lengths of the sides, and \u0394 is the area.\n\nLet me compute the sides:\n\na = AX = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)\nb = XD = sqrt(x^2 + (y - 24)^2)\nc = AD = 24\n\nThe area \u0394 can be calculated as the area of triangle AXD. Since points A and D are on the y-axis, the base is 24, and the height is x. So, area is (base * height)/2 = (24 * x)/2 = 12x.\n\nSo, \u0394 = 12x.\n\nSo, R1 = (a*b*c)/(4\u0394) = (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) * sqrt(x^2 + (y - 24)^2) * 24) / (4 * 12x) )\n\nSimplify denominator: 4*12x = 48x.\n\nSo, R1 = (24 * sqrt(x^2 + y^2) * sqrt(x^2 + (y - 24)^2)) / (48x) )\n\nSimplify: 24/48 = 1/2, so R1 = (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) * sqrt(x^2 + (y - 24)^2)) / (2x) )\n\nGiven that R1 = 13, so:\n\nsqrt(x^2 + y^2) * sqrt(x^2 + (y - 24)^2) / (2x) = 13\n\nSimilarly, let's compute this for triangle BXC.\n\nTriangle BXC has points B(AB,0), X(x,y), C(AB,24). Let's compute the circumradius R2.\n\nSides:\n\na = BX = sqrt((x - AB)^2 + y^2)\nb = XC = sqrt((x - AB)^2 + (y - 24)^2)\nc = BC = 24\n\nThe area \u0394 can be calculated similarly. Since points B and C are on the line x = AB, the base is 24, and the height is AB - x (since X is inside the rectangle, x < AB). So, area is (base * height)/2 = (24*(AB - x))/2 = 12*(AB - x).\n\nSo, R2 = (a*b*c)/(4\u0394) = (sqrt((x - AB)^2 + y^2) * sqrt((x - AB)^2 + (y - 24)^2) * 24 ) / (4 * 12*(AB - x)) )\n\nSimplify denominator: 4*12*(AB - x) = 48*(AB - x)\n\nSo, R2 = (24 * sqrt((x - AB)^2 + y^2) * sqrt((x - AB)^2 + (y - 24)^2)) / (48*(AB - x)) )\n\nSimplify: 24/48 = 1/2, so R2 = ( sqrt((x - AB)^2 + y^2) * sqrt((x - AB)^2 + (y - 24)^2 ) ) / (2*(AB - x) )\n\nGiven that R2 = 15, so:\n\nsqrt((x - AB)^2 + y^2) * sqrt((x - AB)^2 + (y - 24)^2 ) / (2*(AB - x)) = 15\n\nHmm, okay. So now I have two equations:\n\n1. From triangle AXD:\n   sqrt(x^2 + y^2) * sqrt(x^2 + (y - 24)^2) / (2x) = 13\n\n2. From triangle BXC:\n   sqrt((x - AB)^2 + y^2) * sqrt((x - AB)^2 + (y - 24)^2 ) / (2*(AB - x)) = 15\n\nAlso, from angle AXB being 90\u00b0, we have equation (1):\nx^2 - AB*x + y^2 = 0\n\nSo, now we have three equations. Let me write them down more clearly:\n\nEquation 1:\nx^2 - AB*x + y^2 = 0  --> (1)\n\nEquation 2:\n[sqrt(x^2 + y^2) * sqrt(x^2 + (y - 24)^2)] / (2x) = 13  --> (2)\n\nEquation 3:\n[sqrt((x - AB)^2 + y^2) * sqrt((x - AB)^2 + (y - 24)^2)] / [2*(AB - x)] = 15  --> (3)\n\nThis looks a bit messy, but maybe we can find a way to combine them. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote some variables to simplify:\n\nLet me let a = x, b = y. Then, equation (1) becomes:\n\na^2 - AB*a + b^2 = 0 --> (1)\n\nEquation (2):\n\nsqrt(a^2 + b^2) * sqrt(a^2 + (b - 24)^2) / (2a) = 13 --> (2)\n\nEquation (3):\n\nsqrt((a - AB)^2 + b^2) * sqrt((a - AB)^2 + (b - 24)^2) / [2*(AB - a)] = 15 --> (3)\n\nHmm, maybe if I square both sides of equations (2) and (3), I can simplify them.\n\nLet's do that for equation (2):\n\n[sqrt(a^2 + b^2) * sqrt(a^2 + (b - 24)^2)]^2 / (4a^2) = 13^2 = 169\n\nSo, (a^2 + b^2)(a^2 + (b - 24)^2) / (4a^2) = 169\n\nSimilarly, for equation (3):\n\n[sqrt((a - AB)^2 + b^2) * sqrt((a - AB)^2 + (b - 24)^2)]^2 / [4*(AB - a)^2] = 15^2 = 225\n\nSo,\n\n[( (a - AB)^2 + b^2 ) ( (a - AB)^2 + (b - 24)^2 ) ] / [4*(AB - a)^2] = 225\n\nLet me denote AB as 'k' for simplicity. So, k = AB, which is what we need to find.\n\nSo, now equations become:\n\nEquation (1): a^2 - k*a + b^2 = 0 --> (1)\n\nEquation (2): [ (a^2 + b^2)(a^2 + (b - 24)^2) ] / (4a^2) = 169 --> (2)\n\nEquation (3): [ ( (a - k)^2 + b^2 ) ( (a - k)^2 + (b - 24)^2 ) ] / [4*(k - a)^2] = 225 --> (3)\n\nSo, let's compute equation (2):\n\nMultiply both sides by 4a^2:\n\n(a^2 + b^2)(a^2 + (b - 24)^2) = 4a^2 * 169 = 676a^2\n\nSimilarly, equation (3):\n\nMultiply both sides by 4*(k - a)^2:\n\n[ ( (a - k)^2 + b^2 ) ( (a - k)^2 + (b - 24)^2 ) ] = 4*(k - a)^2 * 225 = 900*(k - a)^2\n\nSo, now, equation (2): (a^2 + b^2)(a^2 + (b - 24)^2) = 676a^2\n\nEquation (3): [ ( (a - k)^2 + b^2 ) ( (a - k)^2 + (b - 24)^2 ) ] = 900*(k - a)^2\n\nHmm. Let me think if I can find a relationship between equation (2) and equation (3). Maybe if I consider the terms in equation (3) to be similar to equation (2) but with a substitution.\n\nLooking at equation (2), let's expand the left side:\n\n(a^2 + b^2)(a^2 + (b - 24)^2) = (a^2 + b^2)(a^2 + b^2 - 48b + 576) = ?\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst term: a^2 * a^2 = a^4\n\na^2 * b^2 = a^2 b^2\n\na^2 * (-48b) = -48 a^2 b\n\na^2 * 576 = 576 a^2\n\nb^2 * a^2 = a^2 b^2\n\nb^2 * b^2 = b^4\n\nb^2 * (-48b) = -48 b^3\n\nb^2 * 576 = 576 b^2\n\nSo, combining all terms:\n\na^4 + a^2 b^2 -48 a^2 b + 576 a^2 + a^2 b^2 + b^4 -48 b^3 + 576 b^2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na^4 + 2a^2 b^2 + b^4 -48 a^2 b -48 b^3 + 576 a^2 + 576 b^2\n\nSo, this equals 676a^2.\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor equation (2):\n\nWait, equation (2) is:\n\n(a^2 + b^2)(a^2 + (b - 24)^2) = 676a^2\n\nBut from equation (1), a^2 + b^2 = k a.\n\nBecause equation (1): a^2 - k a + b^2 = 0 \u21d2 a^2 + b^2 = k a.\n\nSo, equation (2) becomes:\n\n(k a) * (a^2 + (b - 24)^2) = 676 a^2\n\nDivide both sides by a (assuming a \u2260 0, which it isn't because X is inside the rectangle):\n\nk * (a^2 + (b - 24)^2) = 676 a\n\nSimilarly, equation (3):\n\n[ ( (a - k)^2 + b^2 ) ( (a - k)^2 + (b - 24)^2 ) ] = 900*(k - a)^2\n\nLet me compute the left side. Notice that (a - k)^2 is (k - a)^2, which is the same as (a - k)^2.\n\nSo, ( (k - a)^2 + b^2 ) and ( (k - a)^2 + (b - 24)^2 )\n\nWait, equation (2) had (a^2 + (b - 24)^2) = (k a) / k? Wait, equation (2) after substitution became k*(a^2 + (b - 24)^2) = 676 a.\n\nSo, from equation (2):\n\na^2 + (b - 24)^2 = (676 a) / k --> let's denote this as equation (2a)\n\nSimilarly, in equation (3), the left side is [( (k - a)^2 + b^2 ) ( (k - a)^2 + (b - 24)^2 ) ].\n\nWhich can be written as [ ( (k - a)^2 + b^2 ) ( (k - a)^2 + (b - 24)^2 ) ] = 900*(k - a)^2\n\nBut wait, notice that (k - a)^2 = (a - k)^2 = a^2 - 2 a k + k^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can relate (k - a)^2 + b^2 and a^2 + (b - 24)^2.\n\nWait, equation (2a): a^2 + (b - 24)^2 = 676 a / k\n\nSimilarly, equation (3) has terms like (k - a)^2 + b^2. Let's see if that can be expressed in terms of equation (1).\n\nFrom equation (1): a^2 + b^2 = k a\n\nSo, (k - a)^2 + b^2 = k^2 - 2 a k + a^2 + b^2 = k^2 - 2 a k + (a^2 + b^2) = k^2 - 2 a k + k a = k^2 - a k\n\nSimilarly, (k - a)^2 + (b - 24)^2 = k^2 - 2 a k + a^2 + b^2 - 48 b + 576 = k^2 - 2 a k + (a^2 + b^2) - 48 b + 576 = k^2 - 2 a k + k a - 48 b + 576 = k^2 - a k - 48 b + 576\n\nSo, equation (3) becomes:\n\n[ (k^2 - a k) * (k^2 - a k - 48 b + 576) ] = 900*(k - a)^2\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can find a way to express in terms of equation (2a).\n\nWait, from equation (2a):\n\na^2 + (b - 24)^2 = 676 a / k\n\nBut from equation (1):\n\na^2 + b^2 = k a\n\nSo, subtract equation (2a) from equation (1):\n\n(a^2 + b^2) - (a^2 + (b -24)^2) = k a - (676 a / k )\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nb^2 - (b^2 - 48 b + 576) = 48 b - 576\n\nRight side:\n\na k - (676 a / k ) = a (k - 676 / k )\n\nSo, 48 b - 576 = a (k - 676 / k )\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n48 b = a (k - 676 / k ) + 576\n\nDivide both sides by 48:\n\nb = (a / 48) (k - 676 / k ) + 12\n\nHmm, so we have b expressed in terms of a.\n\nLet me denote c = k for simplicity.\n\nSo, b = (a / 48)(c - 676/c) + 12 --> equation (4)\n\nThat might be useful later.\n\nNow, let's go back to equation (3):\n\n[ (k^2 - a k) * (k^2 - a k - 48 b + 576) ] = 900*(k - a)^2\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\nFirst term: (k^2 - a k) = k(k - a)\n\nSecond term: (k^2 - a k - 48 b + 576) = k(k - a) - 48 b + 576\n\nSo, the entire left side is [k(k - a)] * [k(k - a) - 48 b + 576]\n\nSo, expand this:\n\nk(k - a) * [k(k - a) -48 b + 576]\n\n= [k(k - a)]^2 - 48 b k(k - a) + 576 k(k - a)\n\nSo, equation (3) becomes:\n\n[k(k - a)]^2 - 48 b k(k - a) + 576 k(k - a) = 900 (k - a)^2\n\nHmm, this looks messy, but maybe we can substitute from equation (4) here.\n\nFrom equation (4):\n\nb = (a / 48)(c - 676/c) + 12, where c = k.\n\nSo, let me compute 48 b:\n\n48 b = a (c - 676/c) + 48 *12 = a(c - 676/c) + 576\n\nSo, 48 b = a(c - 676/c) + 576\n\nThis might help in substitution.\n\nLooking back at equation (3):\n\n[k(k - a)]^2 - 48 b k(k - a) + 576 k(k - a) = 900 (k - a)^2\n\nLet me plug in 48 b from above:\n\n= [k(k - a)]^2 - [a(c - 676/c) + 576] * k(k - a) + 576 k(k - a) = 900 (k - a)^2\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n= [k(k - a)]^2 - a(c - 676/c) k(k - a) - 576 k(k - a) + 576 k(k - a) = 900 (k - a)^2\n\nNotice that -576 k(k - a) + 576 k(k - a) cancels out, so we have:\n\n[k(k - a)]^2 - a(c - 676/c) k(k - a) = 900 (k - a)^2\n\nFactor out k(k - a):\n\nk(k - a) [k(k - a) - a(c - 676/c) ] = 900 (k - a)^2\n\nDivide both sides by (k - a), assuming k \u2260 a, which is true since X is inside the rectangle.\n\nSo:\n\nk [k(k - a) - a(c - 676/c) ] = 900 (k - a)\n\nBut remember that c = k, so let's replace c with k:\n\nk [k(k - a) - a(k - 676/k) ] = 900 (k - a)\n\nLet me compute inside the brackets:\n\nk(k - a) - a(k - 676/k) = k^2 - a k - a k + (676 a)/k = k^2 - 2 a k + (676 a)/k\n\nSo, now equation becomes:\n\nk [k^2 - 2 a k + (676 a)/k ] = 900(k - a )\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\nk*(k^2) - k*(2 a k) + k*(676 a /k ) = k^3 - 2 a k^2 + 676 a\n\nSo, equation:\n\nk^3 - 2 a k^2 + 676 a = 900(k - a)\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\nk^3 - 2 a k^2 + 676 a - 900 k + 900 a = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nk^3 - 2 a k^2 -900 k + (676 a + 900 a) = k^3 - 2 a k^2 -900 k + 1576 a = 0\n\nHmm, so now we have:\n\nk^3 - 2 a k^2 -900 k + 1576 a = 0 --> equation (5)\n\nFrom equation (1), we have a^2 + b^2 = k a. Also, from equation (4), we have b in terms of a and k.\n\nSo, maybe we can substitute b into equation (1) to find a relation between a and k.\n\nFrom equation (4):\n\nb = (a / 48)(k - 676/k) + 12\n\nSo, let me compute b^2:\n\nb^2 = [ (a / 48)(k - 676/k) + 12 ]^2\n\n= [ (a(k^2 - 676) / (48k) ) + 12 ]^2\n\n= [ (a(k^2 - 676) + 576k ) / (48k) ]^2\n\nHmm, seems a bit complicated, but let's proceed.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\na^2 + b^2 = k a\n\nSo, substituting b^2:\n\na^2 + [ (a(k^2 - 676) + 576k ) / (48k) ]^2 = k a\n\nThis seems really complicated, but perhaps we can find a way to express a in terms of k or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find another equation involving a and k.\n\nWait, equation (2a):\n\na^2 + (b -24)^2 = 676 a / k\n\nBut from equation (1), a^2 + b^2 = k a\n\nSo, subtract equation (2a) from equation (1):\n\n(a^2 + b^2) - (a^2 + (b -24)^2 ) = k a - (676 a / k )\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nb^2 - (b^2 -48 b + 576 ) = 48 b -576\n\nRight side:\n\na k - (676 a /k ) = a(k - 676 /k )\n\nSo, 48 b -576 = a (k - 676 /k )\n\nWhich is exactly what we had earlier, leading to equation (4).\n\nSo, perhaps equation (5) is the main equation to work with.\n\nEquation (5):\n\nk^3 - 2 a k^2 -900 k + 1576 a = 0\n\nWe need another equation relating a and k. From equation (1):\n\na^2 + b^2 = k a\n\nAnd from equation (4):\n\nb = (a /48)(k - 676/k ) + 12\n\nSo, perhaps substitute b into equation (1):\n\na^2 + [ (a /48)(k - 676/k ) + 12 ]^2 = k a\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nLet me denote term1 = (a /48)(k - 676/k )\n\nSo, b = term1 + 12\n\nSo, b = term1 + 12\n\nSo, b^2 = (term1 +12)^2 = term1^2 + 24 term1 + 144\n\nSo, equation (1) becomes:\n\na^2 + term1^2 + 24 term1 + 144 = k a\n\nNow, substitute term1:\n\nterm1 = (a (k^2 - 676 )) / (48 k )\n\nSo, term1^2 = [a^2 (k^2 -676)^2 ] / (48^2 k^2 )\n\n24 term1 = 24 * [ a (k^2 - 676) / (48 k ) ] = [24 a (k^2 -676) ] / (48 k ) = [ a (k^2 -676) ] / (2 k )\n\nSo, substituting all into equation (1):\n\na^2 + [a^2 (k^2 -676)^2 ] / (48^2 k^2 ) + [ a (k^2 -676) ] / (2 k ) + 144 = k a\n\nMultiply every term by 48^2 k^2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n48^2 k^2 *a^2 + a^2 (k^2 -676)^2 + 24 a k (k^2 -676) *48 k + 144 *48^2 k^2 = k a *48^2 k^2\n\nWait, no, that's a bit messy. Let me think again.\n\nWait, let's see. Let me compute each term:\n\n1. a^2 multiplied by 48^2 k^2: 48^2 k^2 a^2\n\n2. [a^2 (k^2 -676)^2 ] / (48^2 k^2 ) multiplied by 48^2 k^2: a^2 (k^2 -676)^2\n\n3. [ a (k^2 -676) ] / (2 k ) multiplied by 48^2 k^2: a (k^2 -676) * 48^2 k / 2\n\n4. 144 multiplied by 48^2 k^2: 144 *48^2 k^2\n\nRight side: k a *48^2 k^2 = 48^2 k^3 a\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n48^2 k^2 a^2 + a^2 (k^2 -676)^2 + [ a (k^2 -676) * 48^2 k / 2 ] + 144 *48^2 k^2 = 48^2 k^3 a\n\nHmm, this is getting really complicated. I wonder if there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, maybe I can use equation (5) and equation (4) to express a in terms of k. Let me see.\n\nFrom equation (5):\n\nk^3 - 2 a k^2 -900 k + 1576 a = 0\n\nLet me factor out terms with 'a':\n\n= k^3 -900 k + a*(-2 k^2 + 1576) = 0\n\nSo,\n\na*(-2 k^2 + 1576) = -k^3 +900 k\n\nSo,\n\na = ( -k^3 +900 k ) / ( -2 k^2 +1576 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: -k^3 +900k = -k(k^2 -900 )\n\nDenominator: -2k^2 +1576 = -2(k^2 -788 )\n\nSo,\n\na = [ -k(k^2 -900 ) ] / [ -2(k^2 -788 ) ] = [ k(k^2 -900 ) ] / [ 2(k^2 -788 ) ]\n\nSo,\n\na = [ k (k^2 -900) ] / [ 2(k^2 -788) ]\n\nHmm, that's a useful expression. So, a is expressed in terms of k.\n\nSo, a = [k(k^2 -900)] / [2(k^2 -788)]\n\nLet me denote this as equation (6).\n\nSo, now, maybe I can substitute a into equation (4) to find k.\n\nFrom equation (4):\n\nb = (a /48)(k - 676/k ) + 12\n\nSo, if I can express b in terms of k, then maybe I can find k.\n\nBut equation (1) is a^2 + b^2 = k a, so if I can express b in terms of k, then I can plug back into equation (1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, now that I have a in terms of k, perhaps I can substitute a into equation (1) to get an equation solely in terms of k.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\na^2 + b^2 = k a\n\nBut b is expressed via equation (4). So, let's express b in terms of a and k, then a in terms of k, so b can be expressed solely in terms of k.\n\nFrom equation (4):\n\nb = (a /48)(k - 676/k ) + 12\n\nSubstitute a from equation (6):\n\na = [k(k^2 -900)] / [2(k^2 -788)]\n\nSo,\n\nb = [ [k(k^2 -900)] / [2(k^2 -788)] ] /48 * (k - 676/k ) + 12\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ k(k^2 -900) / (2*48*(k^2 -788)) ] * (k - 676/k ) + 12\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n2*48 = 96, so denominator is 96(k^2 -788)\n\nSo,\n\n= [ k(k^2 -900) / 96(k^2 -788) ] * (k - 676/k ) + 12\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\nk(k^2 -900) * (k - 676/k ) = k(k^2 -900)(k - 676/k )\n\nMultiply this out:\n\n= k*(k^2 -900)*(k - 676/k )\n\nLet me compute (k^2 -900)(k - 676/k )\n\n= k*(k^2 -900) - (676/k)*(k^2 -900)\n\n= k^3 -900 k -676 k + 676*900 /k\n\n= k^3 - (900 + 676)k + (676*900)/k\n\n= k^3 - 1576k + (608,400)/k\n\nSo, the entire numerator is k*(k^3 -1576k + 608400/k )\n\n= k^4 -1576k^2 +608400\n\nSo, putting it back:\n\nb = [ (k^4 -1576k^2 +608400 ) / (96(k^2 -788)) ] + 12\n\nSo,\n\nb = [k^4 -1576k^2 +608400 ] / [96(k^2 -788)] + 12\n\nNow, let's write 12 as [12*96(k^2 -788)] / [96(k^2 -788)] to have a common denominator.\n\nSo,\n\nb = [k^4 -1576k^2 +608400 + 1152(k^2 -788)] / [96(k^2 -788)]\n\nExpand 1152(k^2 -788):\n\n= 1152k^2 - 1152*788\n\nCompute 1152*788:\n\nWell, 1000*788=788,000\n\n152*788: Let's compute 100*788=78,800; 50*788=39,400; 2*788=1,576. So, 78,800 +39,400=118,200 +1,576=119,776\n\nSo, total 1152*788=788,000 +119,776=907,776\n\nSo, 1152(k^2 -788)=1152k^2 -907,776\n\nSo, numerator becomes:\n\nk^4 -1576k^2 +608,400 +1152k^2 -907,776\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nk^4 + (-1576k^2 +1152k^2) + (608,400 -907,776 )\n\n= k^4 -424k^2 -299,376\n\nSo,\n\nb = [k^4 -424k^2 -299,376 ] / [96(k^2 -788)]\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nSo, now, from equation (1):\n\na^2 + b^2 = k a\n\nWe can write this as:\n\na^2 + b^2 -k a = 0\n\nWe have expressions for a and b in terms of k, so let's substitute them.\n\nFrom equation (6):\n\na = [k(k^2 -900)] / [2(k^2 -788)]\n\nSo, a^2 = [k^2(k^2 -900)^2 ] / [4(k^2 -788)^2 ]\n\nFrom above, b = [k^4 -424k^2 -299,376 ] / [96(k^2 -788)]\n\nSo, b^2 = [ (k^4 -424k^2 -299,376 )^2 ] / [ (96(k^2 -788))^2 ]\n\nAnd k a = k * [k(k^2 -900)] / [2(k^2 -788)] = [k^2(k^2 -900)] / [2(k^2 -788)]\n\nSo, putting it all into equation (1):\n\n[ k^2(k^2 -900)^2 ] / [4(k^2 -788)^2 ] + [ (k^4 -424k^2 -299,376 )^2 ] / [ (96(k^2 -788))^2 ] - [k^2(k^2 -900)] / [2(k^2 -788)] = 0\n\nThis is a very complicated equation, but perhaps we can find a common denominator and combine terms.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n1. First term: [k^2(k^2 -900)^2 ] / [4(k^2 -788)^2 ]\n\n2. Second term: [ (k^4 -424k^2 -299,376 )^2 ] / [ 96^2(k^2 -788)^2 ] = [ (k^4 -424k^2 -299,376 )^2 ] / [9216(k^2 -788)^2 ]\n\n3. Third term: [k^2(k^2 -900)] / [2(k^2 -788)] = [k^2(k^2 -900)(k^2 -788)] / [2(k^2 -788)^2 ]\n\nSo, the entire equation is:\n\n[ k^2(k^2 -900)^2 /4 + (k^4 -424k^2 -299,376)^2 /9216 - k^2(k^2 -900)(k^2 -788)/2 ] / (k^2 -788)^2 = 0\n\nWhich implies:\n\nk^2(k^2 -900)^2 /4 + (k^4 -424k^2 -299,376)^2 /9216 - k^2(k^2 -900)(k^2 -788)/2 = 0\n\nThis is a quartic equation, but perhaps it can be solved by substitution.\n\nLet me denote m = k^2.\n\nSo, m = k^2, so equation becomes:\n\nm(m -900)^2 /4 + (m^2 -424m -299,376)^2 /9216 - m(m -900)(m -788)/2 = 0\n\nThis is still complex, but maybe we can compute each term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider a substitution of k to reduce the equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can assume that k is an integer, and try to find k such that the equation is satisfied.\n\nGiven that the problem is a competition-style problem, it's likely that k is an integer.\n\nSo, let me assume that k is an integer. Then, perhaps we can find k by trial and error.\n\nGiven that BC =24, and AB is the side we're trying to find, which is likely a positive integer greater than 24.\n\nSo, let's try to find k such that equation (5):\n\nk^3 - 2 a k^2 -900 k + 1576 a = 0\n\nWith a expressed as [k(k^2 -900)] / [2(k^2 -788)]\n\nHmm, perhaps we can substitute a into equation (5).\n\nFrom equation (5):\n\nk^3 - 2 a k^2 -900 k + 1576 a =0\n\nSubstitute a:\n\n= k^3 - 2 * [k(k^2 -900)/(2(k^2 -788))] *k^2 -900 k + 1576 * [k(k^2 -900)/(2(k^2 -788)) ] =0\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: k^3\n\nSecond term: -2 * [k(k^2 -900)/(2(k^2 -788))] *k^2 = - [k(k^2 -900)/ (k^2 -788) ] *k^2 = -k^3 (k^2 -900)/(k^2 -788)\n\nThird term: -900k\n\nFourth term: 1576*[k(k^2 -900)/(2(k^2 -788)) ] = 788 k (k^2 -900)/(k^2 -788)\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nk^3 - [k^3 (k^2 -900)]/(k^2 -788) -900k + [788 k (k^2 -900)]/(k^2 -788) =0\n\nMultiply every term by (k^2 -788) to eliminate denominators:\n\nk^3 (k^2 -788) -k^3 (k^2 -900) -900k(k^2 -788) +788k(k^2 -900) = 0\n\nNow, expand each term:\n\nFirst term: k^3(k^2 -788) =k^5 -788k^3\n\nSecond term: -k^3(k^2 -900) = -k^5 +900k^3\n\nThird term: -900k(k^2 -788) = -900k^3 +900*788k = -900k^3 +709,200k\n\nFourth term:788k(k^2 -900) =788k^3 -788*900k =788k^3 -709,200k\n\nNow, add all terms together:\n\n(k^5 -788k^3) + (-k^5 +900k^3) + (-900k^3 +709,200k) + (788k^3 -709,200k )\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nk^5 -k^5 =0\n\n-788k^3 +900k^3 -900k^3 +788k^3= 0\n\n709,200k -709,200k=0\n\nSo, all terms cancel out, and we're left with 0=0.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, this equation doesn't give us any new information\u2014it's an identity. That suggests that our earlier steps are consistent but don't help us find k.\n\nSo, perhaps we need another approach.\n\nLet me consider that both triangles AXD and BXC are acute. So, all their angles are less than 90 degrees.\n\nGiven that, perhaps we can use the fact that in an acute triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides.\n\nWait, for any triangle, the circumradius R = a/(2 sin A). In an acute triangle, all angles are less than 90 degrees, so sin A <1.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry to find the positions where the circumradius conditions are satisfied.\n\nWait, another thought: since X lies on the circle with diameter AB (because angle AXB is 90 degrees), the coordinates of X must satisfy equation (1): x^2 - AB x + y^2 = 0.\n\nSo, the circle has center at (AB/2, 0) and radius AB/2.\n\nBut X is also inside the rectangle, so its coordinates are between (0,0) and (AB,24).\n\nSo, maybe I can parameterize X on this circle.\n\nLet me parameterize point X on the circle.\n\nLet me denote AB = k. So, the circle has center at (k/2, 0) and radius k/2.\n\nParametric equations:\n\nx = (k/2) + (k/2) cos \u03b8\n\ny = 0 + (k/2) sin \u03b8\n\nBut since X is inside the rectangle, y must be positive and less than 24. So, sin \u03b8 must be positive, so \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0.\n\nBut also, x must be between 0 and k.\n\nSo, x = (k/2)(1 + cos \u03b8), which ranges from 0 to k as \u03b8 goes from \u03c0 to 0.\n\nSo, with \u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0, x goes from k to 0.\n\nSo, let's write X as:\n\nx = (k/2)(1 + cos \u03b8)\n\ny = (k/2) sin \u03b8\n\nSo, since y must be less than 24, (k/2) sin \u03b8 <24 \u21d2 sin \u03b8 < 48/k.\n\nBut since sin \u03b8 \u22641, so 48/k must be \u22651 \u21d2 k \u226448.\n\nWait, but AB is the side we're trying to find, which is positive. If k is AB, and BC=24, then AB can be any positive number. But if k \u226448, then y could be less than 24.\n\nWait, but X is inside the rectangle, so y must be positive and less than 24.\n\nSo, if k >48, then (k/2) sin \u03b8 can be as large as k/2, which is greater than 24. So, to ensure y <24, we must have (k/2) sin \u03b8 <24 \u21d2 sin \u03b8 < 48/k.\n\nBut sin \u03b8 can be at maximum 1, so if 48/k <1 \u21d2 k>48.\n\nWait, that is, if k>48, then sin \u03b8 <48/k <1, so \u03b8 can vary such that sin \u03b8 <48/k. But if k<=48, then sin \u03b8 can be up to 1, which is allowed.\n\nBut since k is AB, which is the side we're trying to find, perhaps it's possible that k>48 or k<=48.\n\nBut this is getting a bit complicated, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the fact that both triangles AXD and BXC are acute.\n\nIn triangle AXD, all angles are acute. So, in particular, angle at X must be acute.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC.\n\nSo, for triangle AXD, the square of each side must be less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nSo, for triangle AXD:\n\nAX^2 + XD^2 > AD^2\n\nAX^2 + AD^2 > XD^2\n\nXD^2 + AD^2 > AX^2\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC.\n\nBut maybe this can give us some inequalities.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of coordinates.\n\nWait, another idea: Since X is on the circle with diameter AB, perhaps we can use the property that in such a circle, the power of point D with respect to the circle can help us.\n\nWait, the power of point D with respect to the circle with diameter AB is equal to DX * something, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use coordinates to find the circumradius expressions.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nWe have equations for R1 and R2 in terms of a and b, but perhaps since we have a relation between a and k, we can plug in equation (6) into equation (2) or (3).\n\nBut equation (2):\n\n[ (a^2 + b^2)(a^2 + (b -24)^2 ) ] / (4a^2 ) =169\n\nBut from equation (1), a^2 + b^2 =k a, so:\n\n[ k a (a^2 + (b -24)^2 ) ] / (4a^2 ) =169\n\nSimplify:\n\n[ k (a^2 + (b -24)^2 ) ] / (4a ) =169\n\nFrom equation (2a):\n\na^2 + (b -24)^2 = (676 a ) /k\n\nSo,\n\n[ k * (676 a /k ) ] / (4a ) =169\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nk * (676 a /k ) =676 a\n\nDenominator:4a\n\nSo,\n\n676 a /4a =676/4=169, which is equal to the right side, 169.\n\nSo, this is just verifying equation (2), which we already used.\n\nSimilarly, equation (3) would verify similarly.\n\nSo, this suggests that we need another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that triangles AXD and BXC are acute, which might impose constraints on their circumradius.\n\nWait, for a triangle to be acute, the circumradius must satisfy certain conditions. For example, in any triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides by R = a/(2 sin A). For the triangle to be acute, all angles must be less than 90 degrees, so sin A <1, which gives R > a/2 for each side a.\n\nWait, actually, in a triangle, if all angles are acute, then for each side a, a < 2R.\n\nWait, wait, let's see:\n\nIn a triangle, for angle A opposite side a:\n\nIf angle A is acute, then a^2 < b^2 + c^2.\n\nBut also, from the Law of Sines, a = 2 R sin A.\n\nSince A is acute, sin A <1, so a < 2 R.\n\nSimilarly, for all sides, a < 2 R, b < 2 R, c < 2 R.\n\nSo, in triangle AXD, which has circumradius 13, all sides must be less than 26.\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BXC, with R=15, all sides must be less than 30.\n\nSo, in triangle AXD:\n\nAX <26, XD <26, AD=24 <26, which is true.\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BXC:\n\nBX <30, XC <30, BC=24 <30, which is true.\n\nBut this doesn't give us much.\n\nWait, but perhaps more specifically, for a triangle to be acute, the square of each side must be less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nSo, for triangle AXD:\n\nAX^2 + XD^2 > AD^2\n\nAX^2 + AD^2 > XD^2\n\nXD^2 + AD^2 > AX^2\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC.\n\nBut perhaps this can help.\n\nSo, for triangle AXD:\n\nAX^2 + XD^2 > AD^2\n\nWe have AX^2 =x^2 + y^2\n\nXD^2 =x^2 + (y -24)^2\n\nAD^2=24^2=576\n\nSo,\n\n(x^2 + y^2) + (x^2 + (y -24)^2 ) >576\n\nSimplify:\n\n2x^2 + y^2 + (y^2 -48y +576 ) >576\n\n=2x^2 +2y^2 -48y +576 >576\n\nSubtract 576:\n\n2x^2 +2y^2 -48y >0\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nx^2 + y^2 -24y >0\n\nBut from equation (1):\n\nx^2 -k x + y^2=0 \u21d2x^2 + y^2 =k x\n\nSo, substitute:\n\nk x -24 y >0\n\nSimilarly, for triangle AXD to be acute, this must hold.\n\nSimilarly, other inequalities.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle AXD: AX^2 + AD^2 > XD^2\n\nAX^2 + AD^2 = (x^2 + y^2 ) +576\n\nXD^2 =x^2 + (y -24)^2\n\nSo,\n\n(x^2 + y^2 ) +576 >x^2 + (y -24)^2\n\nSimplify:\n\ny^2 +576 > y^2 -48 y +576\n\nSubtract y^2 and 576:\n\n0 > -48 y \u21d248 y >0 \u21d2 y>0\n\nWhich is true since X is inside the rectangle.\n\nSimilarly, the other inequality for triangle AXD:\n\nXD^2 + AD^2 > AX^2\n\nXD^2 + AD^2 = [x^2 + (y -24)^2 ] +576\n\nAX^2 =x^2 + y^2\n\nSo,\n\nx^2 + (y^2 -48 y +576 ) +576 >x^2 + y^2\n\nSimplify:\n\ny^2 -48 y +576 +576 > y^2\n\nSubtract y^2:\n\n-48 y +1152 >0 \u21d248 y <1152 \u21d2 y <24\n\nWhich is also true since X is inside the rectangle.\n\nSo, the only non-trivial inequality is k x -24 y >0.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC.\n\nFor triangle BXC:\n\nBX^2 + XC^2 > BC^2\n\nBX^2 = (x -k)^2 + y^2\n\nXC^2 = (x -k)^2 + (y -24)^2\n\nBC^2 =24^2=576\n\nSo,\n\n[(x -k)^2 + y^2 ] + [(x -k)^2 + (y -24)^2 ] >576\n\nSimplify:\n\n2(x -k)^2 + y^2 + (y^2 -48 y +576 ) >576\n\n=2(x -k)^2 +2 y^2 -48 y +576 >576\n\nSubtract 576:\n\n2(x -k)^2 +2 y^2 -48 y >0\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n(x -k)^2 + y^2 -24 y >0\n\nFrom equation (1): x^2 + y^2 =k x\n\nSo, (x -k)^2 =x^2 -2k x +k^2 = (k x - y^2 ) -2k x +k^2 = -x^2 - y^2 +k^2 ?\n\nWait, let me compute (x -k)^2:\n\n(x -k)^2 =x^2 -2k x +k^2\n\nBut from equation (1): x^2 + y^2 =k x \u21d2x^2 =k x - y^2\n\nSo,\n\n(x -k)^2 = (k x - y^2 ) -2k x +k^2 = -x^2 - y^2 +k^2\n\nWait, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe another approach.\n\nFrom equation (1): x^2 + y^2 =k x\n\nSo, (x -k)^2 + y^2 =x^2 -2k x +k^2 + y^2 = (x^2 + y^2 ) -2k x +k^2 =k x -2k x +k^2 = -k x +k^2 =k (k -x )\n\nSo, (x -k)^2 + y^2 =k (k -x )\n\nSo, the inequality for triangle BXC:\n\n(x -k)^2 + y^2 -24 y >0 \u21d2k(k -x ) -24 y >0 \u21d2k(k -x ) >24 y\n\nSo, from triangle AXD: k x -24 y >0\n\nFrom triangle BXC: k(k -x ) >24 y\n\nSo, we have two inequalities:\n\n1. k x -24 y >0\n\n2. k(k -x ) >24 y\n\nLet me write them as:\n\n1. y < (k x)/24\n\n2. y < [k(k -x )]/24\n\nSo, both these inequalities must hold.\n\nSo, y must be less than the minimum of (k x)/24 and [k(k -x )]/24.\n\nHmm, this gives us a region where point X must lie.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a relation between x and k.\n\nLet me consider the two inequalities.\n\nFrom inequality 1: y < (k x)/24\n\nFrom inequality 2: y < [k(k -x )]/24\n\nSo, the point X must lie below both lines y = (k x)/24 and y = [k(k -x )]/24.\n\nAlso, from equation (1): x^2 + y^2 =k x.\n\nSo, substituting y from inequality 1 into equation (1):\n\nx^2 + [ (k x)/24 ]^2 =k x\n\nSo,\n\nx^2 + (k^2 x^2)/576 =k x\n\nFactor x:\n\nx [x + (k^2 x)/576 -k ]=0\n\nWait, no, better to write:\n\nx^2 (1 + k^2 /576 ) =k x\n\nDivide both sides by x (x \u22600):\n\nx (1 + k^2 /576 ) =k\n\nSo,\n\nx =k / (1 +k^2 /576 ) = (576 k ) / (576 +k^2 )\n\nSimilarly, from inequality 2:\n\ny < [k(k -x )]/24\n\nSubstitute x from above:\n\ny < [k(k - (576k)/(576 +k^2 )) ] /24\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [k ( (k(576 +k^2 ) -576k ) / (576 +k^2 ) ) ] /24\n\n= [k ( (576k +k^3 -576k ) / (576 +k^2 ) ) ] /24\n\n= [k (k^3 ) / (576 +k^2 ) ] /24\n\n= (k^4 ) / [24(576 +k^2 ) ]\n\nSo, y < (k^4 ) / [24(576 +k^2 ) ]\n\nBut from equation (1):\n\ny^2 =k x -x^2\n\nFrom x = (576k)/(576 +k^2 )\n\nSo,\n\ny^2 =k*(576k)/(576 +k^2 ) - [ (576k )/(576 +k^2 ) ]^2\n\n= (576k^2 )/(576 +k^2 ) - (576^2 k^2 )/(576 +k^2 )^2\n\nFactor out 576k^2 / (576 +k^2 )^2:\n\n= [576k^2 (576 +k^2 ) -576^2 k^2 ] / (576 +k^2 )^2\n\n= [576k^2 *576 +576k^4 -576^2 k^2 ] / (576 +k^2 )^2\n\n= [576^2 k^2 +576k^4 -576^2 k^2 ] / (576 +k^2 )^2\n\n=576k^4 / (576 +k^2 )^2\n\nSo, y^2 =576k^4 / (576 +k^2 )^2 \u21d2 y= (24k^2 ) / (576 +k^2 )\n\nSince y is positive.\n\nSo, from inequality 1: y < (k x )/24\n\nBut x =576k/(576 +k^2 )\n\nSo,\n\ny=24k^2/(576 +k^2 ) < [k*(576k)/(576 +k^2 ) ] /24 = [576k^2 ]/[24(576 +k^2 ) ]=24k^2/(576 +k^2 )\n\nSo, y < y. Hmm, that's an equality, which suggests that the inequality is tight.\n\nWait, that might indicate that the point X is on the boundary, but since X is inside the rectangle, perhaps this suggests that X lies on the intersection of the two lines y=(k x)/24 and y= [k(k -x )]/24, which would be the point where these two lines intersect.\n\nSo, solving for x and y where (k x)/24 = [k(k -x )]/24\n\nWhich gives:\n\nk x =k(k -x )\n\nDivide both sides by k (k \u22600):\n\nx =k -x \u21d22x =k \u21d2x =k/2\n\nSo, when x=k/2, both inequalities become equalities, so y= (k*(k/2))/24 =k^2/(48 )\n\nBut since X is inside the rectangle, y must be less than 24, so k^2/48 <24 \u21d2k^2 <1152 \u21d2k < sqrt(1152 )= approx 33.94.\n\nBut earlier, we saw that if k>48, we have y=(k/2) sin \u03b8 <24 \u21d2 sin \u03b8 <48/k, but if k<48, sin \u03b8 can be up to 1.\n\nWait, but from equation (6):\n\na = [k(k^2 -900)]/[2(k^2 -788)]\n\nWe can see that if k^2 -900 and k^2 -788 have the same sign, then a is positive.\n\nSo, k^2 -900 and k^2 -788.\n\nSo, k^2 -788 is less than k^2 -900 if k^2 >900, but wait, k^2 -900 is negative when k^2 <900.\n\nWait, so if k^2 >900, then both numerator and denominator are positive, so a is positive.\n\nIf k^2 <788, then numerator and denominator are both negative, so a is positive.\n\nBut if 788 <k^2 <900, then numerator is negative and denominator is positive, so a is negative, which would place X outside the rectangle (since x cannot be negative). So, k must satisfy either k^2 >900 or k^2 <788.\n\nBut k^2 >900 \u21d2k>30.\n\nAlternatively, k^2 <788 \u21d2k<sqrt(788 )\u224828.07.\n\nBut earlier, from the inequality, k<33.94.\n\nSo, so possible k must be either <28.07 or >30.\n\nBut since we have another condition from the acute triangle.\n\nWait, but from the acute triangle AXD, we have y < (k x )/24, and from equation (1):\n\ny=24k^2/(576 +k^2 )\n\nSo, to satisfy y < (k x )/24, we need:\n\n24k^2/(576 +k^2 ) < (k x )/24\n\nBut from equation (6):\n\nx=576k/(576 +k^2 )\n\nSo, (k x )/24= [k*(576k)/(576 +k^2 ) ] /24= [576k^2 ]/[24(576 +k^2 ) ]=24k^2/(576 +k^2 )\n\nSo, y=24k^2/(576 +k^2 ) <24k^2/(576 +k^2 )\n\nWhich is not possible unless y is strictly less, but in reality, it's equal. So, this suggests that the point X is exactly at the intersection point of the two lines, which is (k/2, k^2 /48 )\n\nBut since X is inside the rectangle, y must be less than 24, so k^2 /48 <24 \u21d2k^2 <1152 \u21d2k <sqrt(1152 )\u224833.94.\n\nSo, k must be less than approximately 33.94.\n\nBut from equation (6), k must be either greater than 30 or less than ~28.07.\n\nSo, possible k is either between 30 and ~33.94 or less than ~28.07.\n\nBut let's think about the circumradius. The circumradius of triangle AXD is 13, which is given, and that of triangle BXC is 15.\n\nWe have expressions for R1 and R2 in terms of k.\n\nWait, let me recall that for triangle AXD, we had:\n\nFrom equation (2a): a^2 + (b -24)^2 =676 a /k\n\nBut from equation (1): a^2 +b^2 =k a\n\nSo, subtract equation (2a):\n\n(b^2 - (b -24)^2 )=k a -676 a /k\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n48 b -576 =a (k -676 /k )\n\nWhich we used earlier.\n\nFrom equation (4): b = (a /48)(k -676/k ) +12\n\nBut from equation (6): a= [k(k^2 -900 ) ]/[2(k^2 -788 ) ]\n\nSo, plugging into equation (4):\n\nb= [ [k(k^2 -900 ) ]/[2(k^2 -788 ) ] /48 ]*(k -676/k ) +12\n\n= [k(k^2 -900 ) (k -676/k ) ] / [96(k^2 -788 ) ] +12\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nk(k^2 -900)(k -676/k )=k^4 -676k^2 -900k^2 +900*676= k^4 -1576k^2 +608,400\n\nSo,\n\nb= [k^4 -1576k^2 +608,400 ] / [96(k^2 -788 ) ] +12\n\n= [k^4 -1576k^2 +608,400 +12*96(k^2 -788 ) ] / [96(k^2 -788 ) ]\n\nCompute 12*96=1152\n\nSo,\n\n= [k^4 -1576k^2 +608,400 +1152k^2 -1152*788 ] / [96(k^2 -788 ) ]\n\nCompute 1152*788:\n\nWell, 1000*788=788,000\n\n152*788= let's compute 100*788=78,800; 50*788=39,400; 2*788=1,576.

      "full_content": "Alright, let's tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, it's about a rectangle ABCD with BC = 24. Point X is inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. Also, triangles AX D and BX C are both acute, and their circumradii are 13 and 15, respectively. We need to find AB. \n\nFirst, let me visualize the rectangle. ABCD is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Let's label the rectangle so that AB and CD are the lengths, and BC and AD are the widths. Since BC is given as 24, then AD is also 24. So, BC = AD = 24. AB is the length we need to find; let's denote AB as 'a' for simplicity.\n\nPoint X is inside the rectangle, and angle AXB is 90 degrees. That means triangle AXB is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at X. So, X lies somewhere inside the rectangle such that when you connect X to A and B, the angle at X is 90 degrees.\n\nTriangles AX D and BX C are both acute and have circumradii 13 and 15, respectively. I remember that the circumradius of a triangle is given by R = (abc)/(4\u0394), where a, b, c are the sides and \u0394 is the area. But since both triangles are acute, their circumcenters lie outside the triangle? Or wait, no, for acute triangles, the circumcenter lies inside the triangle. Hmm, maybe that's not directly useful right now.\n\nAlternatively, for any triangle, the circumradius can also be expressed as R = (a)/(2 sin A), where A is the angle opposite side a. Since the triangles are acute, all angles are less than 90 degrees, which might be useful later.\n\nLet me think about coordinate geometry. Maybe assigning coordinates to the rectangle would help. Let's place point A at (0,0), so since AB is 'a', point B is at (a, 0). Then, point C is at (a, 24), and point D is at (0, 24). So, coordinates are:\n- A: (0,0)\n- B: (a,0)\n- C: (a,24)\n- D: (0,24)\n\nPoint X is inside the rectangle, so its coordinates are (x, y), where 0 < x < a and 0 < y < 24.\n\nGiven that angle AXB is 90 degrees. So, triangle AXB is right-angled at X. Using the property that if two lines are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1. But maybe a better approach is using vectors or the dot product.\n\nAlternatively, since AXB is a right angle at X, the vectors XA and XB should be perpendicular. So, if vector XA is ( -x, -y ) and vector XB is (a - x, -y ), their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, ( -x )( a - x ) + ( -y )( -y ) = 0\n=> -x(a - x) + y\u00b2 = 0\n=> -a x + x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 0\nSo, x\u00b2 - a x + y\u00b2 = 0. Let's note this equation as (1).\n\nNow, moving on to the circumradii. Let's consider triangle AX D first. Its circumradius is 13. Similarly, triangle BX C has a circumradius of 15.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the circumradius R of a triangle with sides of length m, n, p:\nR = (m n p)/(4 \u0394), where \u0394 is the area.\n\nAlternatively, since I don't know the side lengths, maybe I can use another formula. For any triangle, the circumradius R can also be calculated as R = (1/2) * sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 ) / (2) - (sum of squares of medians) ) or something like that... Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, another formula: For a triangle with coordinates known, the circumradius can be found using the formula involving determinants, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the Law of Sines: a / sin A = 2R. So, for triangle AX D, sides AX, XD, and AD.\n\nBut AD is known: it's 24, since AD is a side of the rectangle. Similarly, BC is 24. So, AD = 24.\n\nWait, in triangle AX D, sides are AX, XD, and AD. Similarly, in triangle BX C, sides are BX, XC, and BC, which is 24.\n\nSo, let's compute sides AX, XD, and AD for triangle AX D.\n\nAX is the distance from A to X: sqrt( x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nXD is the distance from X to D: sqrt( (0 - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = sqrt( x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nAD is 24.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BX C:\n\nBX is the distance from B to X: sqrt( (a - x)^2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nXC is the distance from X to C: sqrt( (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nBC is 24.\n\nSo, for triangle AX D, the sides are sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ), sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ), and 24.\n\nGiven that the circumradius R of triangle AX D is 13.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BX C, sides are sqrt( (a - x)^2 + y\u00b2 ), sqrt( (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ), and 24, with R = 15.\n\nI think using the formula R = (a b c)/(4 \u0394) might be a way to go, but that would require knowing the sides and the area. Alternatively, maybe using coordinates and the circumcircle equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that for triangle AX D, since R = 13, then the formula 2 R = length of AD / sin(angle AX D). Hmm, maybe.\n\nWait, in triangle AX D, side AD is 24, and angle opposite to AD is angle AX D. So, 2 R = AD / sin(angle AX D). So, 2*13 = 24 / sin(angle AX D). So, sin(angle AX D) = 24 / (2*13) = 12/13. So, angle AX D is arcsin(12/13). Similarly, for triangle BX C, 2 R = BC / sin(angle BX C). So, 2*15 = 24 / sin(angle BX C). Thus, sin(angle BX C) = 24/(30) = 4/5. So, angle BX C is arcsin(4/5).\n\nHmm, so in triangle AX D, angle at X is arcsin(12/13), which is approximately 67.38 degrees. Similarly, in triangle BX C, angle at X is arcsin(4/5) which is approximately 53.13 degrees. Both angles are acute, which aligns with the problem statement.\n\nSo, we can perhaps express the coordinates of X in terms of these angles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates and setting up equations based on the circumradius.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry to find the circumradius.\n\nFor a triangle with coordinates, the circumradius can be found by the formula:\n\nR = |(a b c)| / (4 \u0394)\n\nBut since I don't know the exact positions of X, maybe I can set up equations based on the circumradius condition.\n\nWait, another approach: for a triangle, the circumradius can also be found using the formula:\n\nR = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{ \\frac{(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)}{ (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2 } }\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that the circumradius is related to the distances from the point X to the vertices.\n\nWait, maybe placing the rectangle in a coordinate system and using coordinates to express the circumradius conditions.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo, in coordinate system, A is (0,0), B is (a,0), C is (a,24), D is (0,24). X is (x,y). So, let's find the circumradius of triangle AX D.\n\nThe circumradius R of triangle AX D can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR = \\frac{ | AX \\cdot XD \\cdot AD | }{ 4 \\cdot \\text{Area of triangle AX D} }\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BX C:\n\nR = \\frac{ | BX \\cdot XC \\cdot BC | }{ 4 \\cdot \\text{Area of triangle BX C} }\n\nSo, let's compute the area for both triangles.\n\nFirst, triangle AX D. The area can be found using the coordinates. The area is |(A x D + X x nothing... Wait, using determinant formula: area = (1/2)| (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) |. \n\nFor triangle AX D:\n\nPoints A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24).\n\nSo, area is (1/2)| 0*(y - 24) + x*(24 - 0) + 0*(0 - y) | = (1/2)|0 + 24x + 0| = 12x.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BX C:\n\nPoints B(a,0), X(x,y), C(a,24).\n\nArea is (1/2)| a*(y - 24) + x*(24 - 0) + a*(0 - y) |.\n\nLet's compute:\n\n= (1/2)| a(y - 24) + x*24 + a(-y) |\n= (1/2)| a y - 24 a + 24 x - a y |\n= (1/2)| -24a + 24x |\n= (1/2)|24(x - a)| \n= 12 |x - a|\n\nSince X is inside the rectangle, x < a, so x - a is negative. So, |x - a| = a - x.\n\nTherefore, area of triangle BX C is 12(a - x).\n\nNow, let's go back to triangle AX D. Its sides:\n\nAX = sqrt( x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nXD = sqrt( x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nAD = 24\n\nCircumradius R1 = 13.\n\nSo,\n\nR1 = (AX * XD * AD) / (4 * Area)\n\nSo,\n\n13 = ( sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) * 24 ) / (4 * 12x )\n\nSimplify denominator: 4 * 12x = 48x.\n\nSo,\n\n13 = (24 * sqrt( (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ) ) / (48x )\n\nSimplify 24 / 48 = 1/2.\n\nSo,\n\n13 = ( sqrt( (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ) ) / (2x )\n\nMultiply both sides by 2x:\n\n26x = sqrt( (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(26x)^2 = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nSo,\n\n676x\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BX C:\n\nSides:\n\nBX = sqrt( (a - x)^2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nXC = sqrt( (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nBC = 24\n\nCircumradius R2 = 15.\n\nSo,\n\n15 = (BX * XC * BC) / (4 * Area )\n\nArea is 12(a - x), so,\n\n15 = ( sqrt( (a - x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) * 24 ) / (4 * 12(a - x) )\n\nSimplify denominator: 4 * 12(a - x) = 48(a - x)\n\nSo,\n\n15 = (24 * sqrt( ( (a - x)^2 + y\u00b2 )( (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ) ) / (48(a - x) )\n\nSimplify 24 / 48 = 1/2.\n\n15 = ( sqrt( ( (a - x)^2 + y\u00b2 )( (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ) ) / (2(a - x) )\n\nMultiply both sides by 2(a - x):\n\n30(a - x) = sqrt( ( (a - x)^2 + y\u00b2 )( (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n[30(a - x)]^2 = ( (a - x)^2 + y\u00b2 )( (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nWhich is,\n\n900(a - x)^2 = ( (a - x)^2 + y\u00b2 )( (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nSo now, we have two equations:\n\n1. 676x\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\n2. 900(a - x)^2 = ( (a - x)^2 + y\u00b2 )( (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nHmm, these look similar. Let me denote u = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 and v = x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2. Then equation 1 becomes 676x\u00b2 = u * v.\n\nSimilarly, for equation 2, let me denote s = (a - x)^2 + y\u00b2 and t = (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2. Then equation 2 becomes 900(a - x)^2 = s * t.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this substitution helps. Maybe I can find a relation between u and v, and between s and t.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps noticing that the right-hand sides of both equations have similar structures. Let me compute u * v and s * t.\n\nCompute u * v:\n\nu = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2\n\nv = x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2\n\nu * v = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nSimilarly, expand this:\n\n= x^4 + x\u00b2(24 - y)^2 + x\u00b2 y\u00b2 + y\u00b2 (24 - y)^2\n\n= x^4 + x\u00b2( (24 - y)^2 + y\u00b2 ) + y\u00b2 (24 - y)^2\n\nSimilarly, for s * t:\n\ns = (a - x)^2 + y\u00b2\n\nt = (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2\n\ns * t = ( (a - x)^2 + y\u00b2 )( (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nWhich expands similarly:\n\n= (a - x)^4 + (a - x)^2 ( y\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) + y\u00b2 (24 - y)^2\n\nSo, both u*v and s*t have the term y\u00b2(24 - y)^2, which is common.\n\nLet me denote K = y\u00b2(24 - y)^2.\n\nThen,\n\nu*v = x^4 + x\u00b2 [ y\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ] + K\n\ns*t = (a - x)^4 + (a - x)^2 [ y\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ] + K\n\nSo, if I denote M = y\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2, then:\n\nu*v = x^4 + M x\u00b2 + K\n\ns*t = (a - x)^4 + M (a - x)^2 + K\n\nThus, equation 1: 676x\u00b2 = x^4 + M x\u00b2 + K\n\nEquation 2: 900(a - x)^2 = (a - x)^4 + M (a - x)^2 + K\n\nSo, if we subtract equation 1 from equation 2, we can eliminate K:\n\n900(a - x)^2 - 676x\u00b2 = (a - x)^4 + M (a - x)^2 + K - (x^4 + M x\u00b2 + K )\n\nSimplify right-hand side:\n\n= (a - x)^4 - x^4 + M( (a - x)^2 - x\u00b2 )\n\nSo,\n\nLeft side: 900(a - x)^2 - 676x\u00b2\n\nRight side: (a - x)^4 - x^4 + M( (a - x)^2 - x\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst, expand (a - x)^4 - x^4:\n\n= (a^4 - 4a\u00b3x + 6a\u00b2x\u00b2 - 4a x\u00b3 + x^4) - x^4\n\n= a^4 - 4a\u00b3x + 6a\u00b2x\u00b2 - 4a x\u00b3\n\nSimilarly, M = y\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 = y\u00b2 + 576 - 48y + y\u00b2 = 2y\u00b2 - 48y + 576\n\nSo, M = 2y\u00b2 - 48y + 576\n\nSo, M factors as 2(y\u00b2 - 24y + 288) = 2[(y - 12)^2 + 288 - 144] = 2[(y - 12)^2 + 144], but maybe this isn't helpful.\n\nBut let's compute (a - x)^2 - x\u00b2:\n\n= (a\u00b2 - 2a x + x\u00b2) - x\u00b2\n\n= a\u00b2 - 2a x\n\nSo, the right side becomes:\n\n(a^4 - 4a\u00b3x + 6a\u00b2x\u00b2 - 4a x\u00b3) + M(a\u00b2 - 2a x )\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nLeft side: 900(a - x)^2 - 676x\u00b2 = 900(a\u00b2 - 2a x + x\u00b2) - 676x\u00b2 = 900a\u00b2 - 1800a x + 900x\u00b2 - 676x\u00b2 = 900a\u00b2 - 1800a x + 224x\u00b2\n\nRight side: a^4 - 4a\u00b3x + 6a\u00b2x\u00b2 - 4a x\u00b3 + M(a\u00b2 - 2a x )\n\nSo,\n\n900a\u00b2 - 1800a x + 224x\u00b2 = a^4 - 4a\u00b3x + 6a\u00b2x\u00b2 - 4a x\u00b3 + M a\u00b2 - 2 M a x\n\nLet me move all terms to the left side:\n\n900a\u00b2 - 1800a x + 224x\u00b2 - a^4 + 4a\u00b3x - 6a\u00b2x\u00b2 + 4a x\u00b3 - M a\u00b2 + 2 M a x = 0\n\nThis seems quite complicated. Maybe I should look for another way.\n\nAlternatively, since we have a rectangle and angle AXB is 90 degrees, perhaps X lies on the circle with diameter AB. Wait, no, because in a rectangle, the circle with diameter AB would have center at the midpoint of AB and radius a/2. But since angle AXB is 90 degrees, X lies on the circle with diameter AB. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, in general, if angle AXB is 90 degrees, then X lies on the circle whose diameter is AB. Because of Thales' theorem. So, in this case, since AB is a side of the rectangle, the circle with diameter AB is the circle with center at (a/2, 0) and radius a/2. So, point X lies on this circle. Therefore, the coordinates (x, y) of X satisfy the equation:\n\n(x - a/2)^2 + y^2 = (a/2)^2\n\nExpanding this:\n\nx\u00b2 - a x + (a\u00b2)/4 + y\u00b2 = (a\u00b2)/4\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 - a x + y\u00b2 = 0\n\nWhich is exactly equation (1) we had earlier. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, point X is on the circle with diameter AB, which gives us equation (1): x\u00b2 - a x + y\u00b2 = 0.\n\nSo, from equation (1), we have y\u00b2 = a x - x\u00b2.\n\nSo, perhaps we can substitute y\u00b2 in equations 1 and 2.\n\nSo, let's substitute y\u00b2 = a x - x\u00b2 into the earlier equations.\n\nStarting with equation 1: 676x\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nSince y\u00b2 = a x - x\u00b2, substitute:\n\n= (x\u00b2 + a x - x\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\n= (a x)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes:\n\n676x\u00b2 = a x (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nDivide both sides by x (since x \u2260 0, as X is inside the rectangle):\n\n676x = a (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nLet me compute x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2.\n\nFrom y\u00b2 = a x - x\u00b2,\n\nSo, (24 - y)^2 = 576 - 48 y + y\u00b2 = 576 - 48 y + a x - x\u00b2\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 = x\u00b2 + 576 - 48 y + a x - x\u00b2 = 576 - 48 y + a x\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes:\n\n676x = a (576 - 48 y + a x )\n\nSo,\n\n676x = 576 a - 48 a y + a\u00b2 x\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n676x - a\u00b2 x + 48 a y - 576 a = 0\n\nFactor:\n\nx (676 - a\u00b2) + 48 a y - 576 a = 0\n\nSimilarly, perhaps we can find another equation from the second equation involving R2.\n\nRecall equation 2: 900(a - x)^2 = ( (a - x)^2 + y\u00b2 )( (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nAgain, substitute y\u00b2 = a x - x\u00b2.\n\nCompute (a - x)^2 + y\u00b2 = (a - x)^2 + a x - x\u00b2\n\n= a\u00b2 - 2a x + x\u00b2 + a x - x\u00b2\n\n= a\u00b2 - a x\n\nSimilarly, (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 = (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2\n\n= a\u00b2 - 2a x + x\u00b2 + 576 - 48 y + y\u00b2\n\nBut y\u00b2 = a x - x\u00b2, so:\n\n= a\u00b2 - 2a x + x\u00b2 + 576 - 48 y + a x - x\u00b2\n\n= a\u00b2 - a x + 576 - 48 y\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\n900(a - x)^2 = (a\u00b2 - a x)(a\u00b2 - a x + 576 - 48 y )\n\nLet me denote T = a\u00b2 - a x. Then,\n\n= T ( T + 576 - 48 y )\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\n900(a - x)^2 = T (T + 576 - 48 y )\n\nBut T = a\u00b2 - a x = a(a - x). So, 900(a - x)^2 = a(a - x)( T + 576 - 48 y )\n\nDivide both sides by (a - x) (since a \u2260 x as X is inside the rectangle):\n\n900(a - x) = a (T + 576 - 48 y )\n\nBut T = a\u00b2 - a x, so:\n\n900(a - x) = a (a\u00b2 - a x + 576 - 48 y )\n\nExpand the right-hand side:\n\n= a\u00b3 - a\u00b2 x + 576 a - 48 a y\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\n900a - 900x = a\u00b3 - a\u00b2 x + 576 a - 48 a y\n\nBring all terms to the left:\n\n900a - 900x - a\u00b3 + a\u00b2 x - 576 a + 48 a y = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(900a - 576a) + (-900x) + (-a\u00b3 + a\u00b2 x) + 48 a y = 0\n\nWhich is:\n\n324a - 900x - a\u00b3 + a\u00b2 x + 48 a y = 0\n\nLet me factor terms:\n\n= (-a\u00b3 + a\u00b2 x) + (-900x) + (324a) + (48 a y )\n\n= -a\u00b2(a - x) -900x + 324a + 48 a y\n\nHmm, not so helpful.\n\nWait, but from equation 1, we had:\n\nx (676 - a\u00b2) + 48 a y - 576 a = 0\n\nSo, rearranged:\n\n48 a y = -x (676 - a\u00b2) + 576 a\n\nSo,\n\ny = [ -x (676 - a\u00b2) + 576 a ] / (48 a )\n\n= [ (a\u00b2 - 676) x + 576 a ] / (48 a )\n\n= [ (a\u00b2 - 676) x ] / (48 a ) + (576 a ) / (48 a )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ (a\u00b2 - 676)/(48 a ) ] x + 12\n\nSo, y = [ (a\u00b2 - 676)/(48 a ) ] x + 12\n\nLet me note this as equation (3).\n\nNow, we can substitute y from equation (3) into equation 2's transformed version.\n\nEquation 2 transformed:\n\n324a - 900x - a\u00b3 + a\u00b2 x + 48 a y = 0\n\nSubstitute y:\n\n= 324a - 900x - a\u00b3 + a\u00b2 x + 48 a [ ( (a\u00b2 - 676)/(48 a ) x + 12 ) ]\n\nSimplify the 48 a term:\n\n48a * [ term ] = 48a * [ (a\u00b2 -676)/(48a) x + 12 ] = (a\u00b2 -676) x + 576 a\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n324a - 900x - a\u00b3 + a\u00b2 x + (a\u00b2 -676)x + 576a = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- a\u00b3 + [ a\u00b2 x + (a\u00b2 -676) x ] + [324a + 576a] -900x = 0\n\nSimplify each group:\n\na\u00b2 x + a\u00b2 x -676 x = 2a\u00b2 x -676 x\n\n324a + 576a = 900a\n\nSo,\n\n- a\u00b3 + (2a\u00b2 x -676 x ) + 900a -900x =0\n\nFactor x from the middle terms:\n\n= -a\u00b3 + x(2a\u00b2 -676 ) + 900a -900x = 0\n\nCombine the x terms:\n\n= -a\u00b3 + x(2a\u00b2 -676 -900 ) +900a =0\n\nSimplify:\n\n= -a\u00b3 + x(2a\u00b2 -1576 ) +900a =0\n\nSo,\n\nx(2a\u00b2 -1576 ) = a\u00b3 -900a\n\nSo,\n\nx = (a\u00b3 -900a ) / (2a\u00b2 -1576 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nFactor numerator:\n\na(a\u00b2 -900 ) = a(a -30)(a +30 )\n\nDenominator:\n\n2(a\u00b2 -788 )\n\nWait, 2a\u00b2 -1576 = 2(a\u00b2 -788 )\n\nSo,\n\nx = [ a(a\u00b2 -900) ] / [ 2(a\u00b2 -788 ) ]\n\nLet me note this as equation (4).\n\nNow, from equation (3):\n\ny = [ (a\u00b2 -676)/(48 a ) ] x + 12\n\nWe can substitute x from equation (4) into this.\n\nLet me compute:\n\ny = [ (a\u00b2 -676)/(48 a ) ] * [ a(a\u00b2 -900) / (2(a\u00b2 -788 )) ] + 12\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ (a\u00b2 -676) * a(a\u00b2 -900) ] / [ 48 a * 2(a\u00b2 -788 ) ] +12\n\nCancel a in numerator and denominator:\n\n= [ (a\u00b2 -676)(a\u00b2 -900) ] / [ 96 (a\u00b2 -788 ) ] +12\n\nSo,\n\ny = [ (a\u00b2 -676)(a\u00b2 -900) ] / [ 96 (a\u00b2 -788 ) ] +12\n\nLet me denote N = a\u00b2, to make it easier.\n\nSo,\n\ny = [ (N -676)(N -900) ] / [ 96 (N -788 ) ] +12\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\n(N -676)(N -900) = N\u00b2 -900N -676N + 676*900 = N\u00b2 -1576N + 608,400\n\nSo,\n\ny = [ N\u00b2 -1576N +608400 ] / [96 (N -788 ) ] +12\n\nWe can perform polynomial division on N\u00b2 -1576N +608400 divided by N -788.\n\nLet me do that:\n\nDivide N\u00b2 -1576N +608400 by N -788.\n\nDivide N\u00b2 by N: N.

Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider the rectangle and point X.\n\nGiven that angle AXB is 90\u00b0, and triangles AX D and BX C are acute with circumradii 13 and 15.\n\nPerhaps using the fact that in a rectangle, the distances from X to A, B, C, D can be expressed in terms of x and y, and we can relate them via the given circumradii.\n\nWait, another idea: Using the property that in triangle AX D, the circumradius R is 13. So, 2 R = 26 is equal to the diameter, which is the length of AD / sin(angle AX D).\n\nEarlier, we found that sin(angle AX D ) =12/13, so angle AX D is arcsin(12/13 ). Similarly, for triangle BX C, sin(angle BX C )=4/5.\n\nSo, perhaps using the Law of Sines for both triangles.\n\nIn triangle AX D:\n\nAD / sin(angle AX D ) = 2 R\n\nWhich we did, leading to sin(angle AX D )=12/13.\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BX C:\n\nBC / sin(angle BX C )=2 R\n\nWhich gave sin(angle BX C )=4/5.\n\nSo, in triangle AX D:\n\nsin(angle AX D )=12/13 \u21d2 angle AX D is arcsin(12/13 ).\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BX C:\n\nsin(angle BX C )=4/5 \u21d2 angle BX C is arcsin(4/5 ).\n\nSo, perhaps using the Law of Sines in both triangles to get expressions involving the sides.\n\nIn triangle AX D:\n\nAX / sin(angle ADX ) = 2 R =26\n\nSimilarly, XD / sin(angle ADX )=26\n\nWait, in triangle AX D, angle at D is angle ADX, which is adjacent to side AX and opposite to angle AX D.\n\nWait, perhaps more precise:\n\nIn triangle AX D:\n\n- angle at X: angle AX D = arcsin(12/13 )\n\n- sides: AX, XD, AD=24\n\nSo, by the Law of Sines:\n\nAX / sin(angle ADX ) = XD / sin(angle DAX ) = AD / sin(angle AX D ) =26\n\nSo,\n\nAX =26 sin(angle ADX )\n\nXD=26 sin(angle DAX )\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BX C:\n\nBX =30 sin(angle BCX )\n\nXC=30 sin(angle CBX )\n\nBut perhaps this is not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates again, but with vector approaches.\n\nWait, another idea: Let's compute the coordinates of X from the two circumradius conditions.\n\nGiven that triangle AX D has circumradius 13, and triangle BX C has circumradius 15.\n\nBut maybe using the formula for the circumradius in terms of coordinates.\n\nThe formula for the circumradius of a triangle with vertices (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) is:\n\nR = \\frac{ \\sqrt{ (|AB|^2 |BC|^2 |CA|^2) } }{ 4 |\u0394| }\n\nBut computing this might be involved. Alternatively, using the formula:\n\nR = \\frac{abc}{4\u0394}\n\nWhere a,b,c are the sides, and \u0394 is the area.\n\nBut we know R, and we can express a, b, c in terms of x and y.\n\nSo, for triangle AX D:\n\nSides:\n\nAX = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nXD = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nAD =24\n\nArea \u03941=12x\n\nSo,\n\nR1=13= (AX * XD * AD )/(4 \u03941 )\n\nWhich is,\n\n13 = ( sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) *24 )/(4 *12x )\n\nSimplify:\n\n13= (24 sqrt( (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )) )/(48x )\n\n= sqrt( (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) )/(2x )\n\nWhich brings us back to equation 1:\n\nsqrt( (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) )=26x\n\nSo, 676x\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BX C:\n\nSides:\n\nBX= sqrt( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nXC= sqrt( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nBC=24\n\nArea \u03942=12(a -x )\n\nSo,\n\nR2=15= (BX * XC * BC )/(4 \u03942 )\n\nWhich is,\n\n15= ( sqrt( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) *24 )/(4 *12(a -x ) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n15= (24 sqrt( ( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 )( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ) )/(48(a -x ) )\n\n= sqrt( ( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 )( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) )/(2(a -x ) )\n\nWhich brings us back to equation 2:\n\nsqrt( ( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 )( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) )=30(a -x )\n\nSo, square both sides:\n\n( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 )( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )=900(a -x )\u00b2\n\nSo, we're back to where we were earlier.\n\nGiven that this approach is getting too involved, perhaps I should try assigning specific values or looking for symmetry.\n\nWait, let me consider that since X lies on the circle with diameter AB, and angle AXB is 90 degrees, the coordinates of X satisfy x\u00b2 - a x + y\u00b2=0.\n\nWe can also express y in terms of x and a.
