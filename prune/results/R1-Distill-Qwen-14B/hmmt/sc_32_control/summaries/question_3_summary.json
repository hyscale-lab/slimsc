      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here with three equations involving x, y, and z. They're all positive real numbers, which is good because that means I don't have to worry about negative values messing things up. The equations are:\n\n1. \\(x^{\\log _{2}(y z)} = 2^{8} \\cdot 3^{4}\\)\n2. \\(y^{\\log _{2}(z x)} = 2^{9} \\cdot 3^{6}\\)\n3. \\(z^{\\log _{2}(x y)} = 2^{5} \\cdot 3^{10}\\)\n\nAnd I need to find the smallest possible value of \\(xyz\\).\n\nHmm, okay. So let's try to make sense of these equations. They all have variables raised to logarithms with base 2 of products of the other two variables. That seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify them using logarithm properties or exponents.\n\nI remember that \\(a^{\\log_b c} = c^{\\log_b a}\\). Maybe that can help. Let me try that on the first equation:\n\n\\(x^{\\log _{2}(y z)} = (y z)^{\\log _{2} x}\\)\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes:\n\n\\((y z)^{\\log _{2} x} = 2^{8} \\cdot 3^{4}\\)\n\nSimilarly, let's do that for the other equations:\n\nEquation 2:\n\n\\(y^{\\log _{2}(z x)} = (z x)^{\\log _{2} y}\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\((z x)^{\\log _{2} y} = 2^{9} \\cdot 3^{6}\\)\n\nEquation 3:\n\n\\(z^{\\log _{2}(x y)} = (x y)^{\\log _{2} z}\\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\((x y)^{\\log _{2} z} = 2^{5} \\cdot 3^{10}\\)\n\nHmm, now each equation is of the form (product)^{log of another variable} equals some power of 2 and 3. Maybe I can take logarithms on both sides to linearize them. Let me try that.\n\nTake natural logs, or base 2? Since the exponents are base 2, maybe base 2 is better.\n\nLet me take \\(\\log_2\\) of both sides for each equation.\n\nStarting with equation 1:\n\n\\(\\log_2\\left( (y z)^{\\log _{2} x} \\right) = \\log_2 (2^{8} \\cdot 3^{4})\\)\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule: \\(a \\log_b c = \\log_b (c^a)\\), so:\n\n\\((\\log_2 x) \\cdot \\log_2 (y z) = \\log_2 (2^{8} \\cdot 3^{4})\\)\n\nSimilarly, equation 2:\n\n\\(\\log_2\\left( (z x)^{\\log _{2} y} \\right) = \\log_2 (2^{9} \\cdot 3^{6})\\)\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n\\((\\log_2 y) \\cdot \\log_2 (z x) = \\log_2 (2^{9} \\cdot 3^{6})\\)\n\nEquation 3:\n\n\\(\\log_2\\left( (x y)^{\\log _{2} z} \\right) = \\log_2 (2^{5} \\cdot 3^{10})\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\((\\log_2 z) \\cdot \\log_2 (x y) = \\log_2 (2^{5} \\cdot 3^{10})\\)\n\nNow, let's compute the right-hand sides of each equation.\n\nStarting with equation 1:\n\n\\(\\log_2 (2^{8} \\cdot 3^{4}) = \\log_2 2^{8} + \\log_2 3^{4} = 8 + 4 \\log_2 3\\)\n\nEquation 2:\n\n\\(\\log_2 (2^{9} \\cdot 3^{6}) = 9 + 6 \\log_2 3\\)\n\nEquation 3:\n\n\\(\\log_2 (2^{5} \\cdot 3^{10}) = 5 + 10 \\log_2 3\\)\n\nSo now, each equation is:\n\n1. \\((\\log_2 x) \\cdot (\\log_2 y + \\log_2 z) = 8 + 4 \\log_2 3\\)\n2. \\((\\log_2 y) \\cdot (\\log_2 z + \\log_2 x) = 9 + 6 \\log_2 3\\)\n3. \\((\\log_2 z) \\cdot (\\log_2 x + \\log_2 y) = 5 + 10 \\log_2 3\\)\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit more manageable. Let me denote:\n\nLet \\(a = \\log_2 x\\), \\(b = \\log_2 y\\), and \\(c = \\log_2 z\\). Then, the equations become:\n\n1. \\(a (b + c) = 8 + 4 k\\), where \\(k = \\log_2 3\\)\n2. \\(b (a + c) = 9 + 6 k\\)\n3. \\(c (a + b) = 5 + 10 k\\)\n\nSo, now we have a system of three equations:\n\n1. \\(a(b + c) = 8 + 4k\\) ... (1)\n2. \\(b(a + c) = 9 + 6k\\) ... (2)\n3. \\(c(a + b) = 5 + 10k\\) ... (3)\n\nAnd we need to find \\(xyz\\). Since \\(x = 2^a\\), \\(y = 2^b\\), \\(z = 2^c\\), so \\(xyz = 2^{a + b + c}\\). Therefore, we need to find \\(a + b + c\\), and then compute \\(2^{a + b + c}\\).\n\nLet me denote \\(S = a + b + c\\). Then, from the equations:\n\nEquation (1): \\(a(S - a) = 8 + 4k\\)\n\nEquation (2): \\(b(S - b) = 9 + 6k\\)\n\nEquation (3): \\(c(S - c) = 5 + 10k\\)\n\nSo, each equation is a quadratic in a, b, c respectively.\n\nAlternatively, we can write each as:\n\n1. \\(a S - a^2 = 8 + 4k\\) ... (1a)\n2. \\(b S - b^2 = 9 + 6k\\) ... (2a)\n3. \\(c S - c^2 = 5 + 10k\\) ... (3a)\n\nHmm, if I subtract equation (1a) from equation (2a), I get:\n\n\\((b S - b^2) - (a S - a^2) = (9 + 6k) - (8 + 4k)\\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\(S(b - a) - (b^2 - a^2) = 1 + 2k\\)\n\nFactor the difference of squares:\n\n\\(S(b - a) - (b - a)(b + a) = 1 + 2k\\)\n\nFactor out (b - a):\n\n\\((b - a)(S - (b + a)) = 1 + 2k\\)\n\nBut \\(S = a + b + c\\), so \\(S - (b + a) = c\\). Therefore,\n\n\\((b - a) c = 1 + 2k\\) ... (4)\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation (2a) from equation (3a):\n\n\\((c S - c^2) - (b S - b^2) = (5 + 10k) - (9 + 6k)\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(S(c - b) - (c^2 - b^2) = -4 + 4k\\)\n\nFactor:\n\n\\(S(c - b) - (c - b)(c + b) = -4 + 4k\\)\n\nFactor out (c - b):\n\n\\((c - b)(S - (c + b)) = -4 + 4k\\)\n\nAgain, \\(S - (c + b) = a\\), so:\n\n\\((c - b) a = -4 + 4k\\) ... (5)\n\nAnd subtract equation (1a) from equation (3a):\n\n\\((c S - c^2) - (a S - a^2) = (5 + 10k) - (8 + 4k)\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(S(c - a) - (c^2 - a^2) = -3 + 6k\\)\n\nFactor:\n\n\\(S(c - a) - (c - a)(c + a) = -3 + 6k\\)\n\nFactor out (c - a):\n\n\\((c - a)(S - (c + a)) = -3 + 6k\\)\n\nBut \\(S - (c + a) = b\\), so:\n\n\\((c - a) b = -3 + 6k\\) ... (6)\n\nSo now, equations (4), (5), and (6):\n\n4. \\((b - a) c = 1 + 2k\\)\n5. \\((c - b) a = -4 + 4k\\)\n6. \\((c - a) b = -3 + 6k\\)\n\nHmm, this is a system of three equations with variables a, b, c. It's still a bit complicated, but perhaps I can express these in terms of each other.\n\nLet me note that equation (4) is similar to equation (5), but with different variables. Maybe I can find ratios or expressions for (b - a), (c - b), etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can denote some differences.\n\nLet me let u = b - a, v = c - b, w = a - c. Wait, but that might not be necessary. Alternatively, maybe express variables in terms of each other.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the variables as a, b, c and try to express them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write equations (4), (5), (6) as:\n\nFrom (4): \\(c = \\frac{1 + 2k}{b - a}\\) ... (4a)\n\nFrom (5): \\(a = \\frac{-4 + 4k}{c - b}\\) ... (5a)\n\nFrom (6): \\(b = \\frac{-3 + 6k}{c - a}\\) ... (6a)\n\nWait, but this could get messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can write in terms of u, v, w where u = b - a, v = c - b, so that c = a + u + v.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a way. Let me try:\n\nLet u = b - a, v = c - b, so that:\n\nb = a + u,\n\nc = b + v = a + u + v.\n\nSo, in terms of a, u, v, we have:\n\nFrom equation (4):\n\nu * c = 1 + 2k\n\nBut c = a + u + v,\n\nSo, u(a + u + v) = 1 + 2k ... (4b)\n\nFrom equation (5):\n\n(c - b) a = (-4 + 4k)\n\nBut c - b = v,\n\nSo, v a = -4 + 4k ... (5b)\n\nFrom equation (6):\n\n(c - a) b = (-3 + 6k)\n\nBut c - a = u + v,\n\nAnd b = a + u,\n\nSo, (u + v)(a + u) = -3 + 6k ... (6b)\n\nSo, now, equations (4b), (5b), (6b):\n\n(4b) u(a + u + v) = 1 + 2k\n\n(5b) v a = -4 + 4k\n\n(6b) (u + v)(a + u) = -3 + 6k\n\nHmm, maybe this substitution is helpful.\n\nLet me see. From (5b), we have v = (-4 + 4k)/a.\n\nSo, plug this into (4b):\n\nu(a + u + v) = u(a + u + (-4 + 4k)/a ) = 1 + 2k\n\nSimilarly, plug v into (6b):\n\n(u + v)(a + u) = [u + (-4 + 4k)/a ] (a + u) = -3 + 6k\n\nSo, let me denote this:\n\nEquation (4b):\n\nu [ a + u + ( (-4 + 4k)/a ) ] = 1 + 2k ... (4c)\n\nEquation (6b):\n\n[ u - (4 - 4k)/a ] (a + u) = -3 + 6k ... (6c)\n\nThis seems a bit involved, but perhaps I can manage.\n\nLet me also note that k = log_2 3. Let me compute the numerical value to see if that helps. Since 3 is about 2^1.58496, so log_2 3 \u2248 1.58496. So k \u2248 1.58496.\n\nBut maybe it's better to keep it symbolic for now.\n\nLet me see, from equation (5b), v a = (-4 + 4k) = 4(k - 1)\n\nSo, v = [4(k - 1)] / a\n\nSimilarly, let me plug v into equation (4c):\n\nu [ a + u + (4(k - 1)/a) ] = 1 + 2k\n\nLet me denote that as:\n\nu [a + u + (4(k -1))/a ] = 1 + 2k ... (4d)\n\nAnd equation (6c):\n\n[ u - 4(k -1)/a ] (a + u) = -3 + 6k ... (6c)\n\nHmm, perhaps I can denote some terms here.\n\nLet me let t = a + u.\n\nThen, equation (6c) becomes:\n\n[ u - 4(k -1)/a ] t = -3 + 6k\n\nBut u = b - a, t = a + u = a + (b - a) = b.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Wait, t = a + u = a + (b - a) = b.\n\nSo equation (6c) is:\n\n[ u - 4(k -1)/a ] b = -3 + 6k\n\nBut from equation (4c):\n\nu [ a + u + (4(k -1)/a) ] = 1 + 2k\n\nBut a + u + 4(k -1)/a = a + (b -a) + 4(k -1)/a = b + 4(k -1)/a\n\nSo equation (4c) becomes:\n\nu [ b + 4(k -1)/a ] = 1 + 2k\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled, but perhaps I can express some variables in terms of others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can assume some relations between a, b, c.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the original variables x, y, z. Since the right-hand sides of the original equations are products of powers of 2 and 3, maybe x, y, z can be expressed in terms of 2^m * 3^n for some exponents m, n.\n\nThat might be a good approach. Let me try that.\n\nLet me suppose that x = 2^{p} * 3^{q}, y = 2^{r} * 3^{s}, z = 2^{t} * 3^{u}, where p, q, r, s, t, u are real numbers. Then, perhaps I can find equations for p, q, r, s, t, u.\n\nThen, let's compute each equation.\n\nFirst equation:\n\nx^{log_2(y z)} = 2^{8} * 3^{4}\n\nCompute y z: y z = 2^{r + t} * 3^{s + u}\n\nSo, log_2(y z) = log_2(2^{r + t} * 3^{s + u}) = (r + t) + (s + u) log_2 3\n\nBut x is 2^{p} * 3^{q}, so x^{log_2(y z)} is [2^{p} * 3^{q}]^{(r + t) + (s + u) log_2 3}\n\nWhich equals 2^{p [(r + t) + (s + u) log_2 3]} * 3^{q [(r + t) + (s + u) log_2 3]}\n\nThis is equal to 2^{8} * 3^{4}, so we can set exponents equal:\n\nFor 2: p [(r + t) + (s + u) log_2 3] = 8 ... (1b)\n\nFor 3: q [(r + t) + (s + u) log_2 3] = 4 ... (1c)\n\nSimilarly, let's do the same for equation 2:\n\ny^{log_2(z x)} = 2^{9} * 3^{6}\n\nCompute z x: z x = 2^{t + p} * 3^{u + q}\n\nlog_2(z x) = (t + p) + (u + q) log_2 3\n\nThen, y^{log_2(z x)} = [2^{r} * 3^{s}]^{(t + p) + (u + q) log_2 3}\n\nWhich equals 2^{r [(t + p) + (u + q) log_2 3]} * 3^{s [(t + p) + (u + q) log_2 3]}\n\nSet equal to 2^9 * 3^6:\n\nFor 2: r [(t + p) + (u + q) log_2 3] = 9 ... (2b)\n\nFor 3: s [(t + p) + (u + q) log_2 3] = 6 ... (2c)\n\nEquation 3:\n\nz^{log_2(x y)} = 2^{5} * 3^{10}\n\nCompute x y: x y = 2^{p + r} * 3^{q + s}\n\nlog_2(x y) = (p + r) + (q + s) log_2 3\n\nThen, z^{log_2(x y)} = [2^{t} * 3^{u}]^{(p + r) + (q + s) log_2 3}\n\nWhich equals 2^{t [(p + r) + (q + s) log_2 3]} * 3^{u [(p + r) + (q + s) log_2 3]}\n\nSet equal to 2^5 * 3^10:\n\nFor 2: t [(p + r) + (q + s) log_2 3] = 5 ... (3b)\n\nFor 3: u [(p + r) + (q + s) log_2 3] = 10 ... (3c)\n\nSo now, we have six equations, (1b), (1c), (2b), (2c), (3b), (3c):\n\n(1b): p [ (r + t) + (s + u) k ] = 8, where k = log_2 3\n\n(1c): q [ (r + t) + (s + u) k ] = 4\n\n(2b): r [ (t + p) + (u + q) k ] = 9\n\n(2c): s [ (t + p) + (u + q) k ] = 6\n\n(3b): t [ (p + r) + (q + s) k ] = 5\n\n(3c): u [ (p + r) + (q + s) k ] = 10\n\nHmm, this seems complex, but perhaps I can find ratios between variables.\n\nNotice that in each pair, like (1b) and (1c), the term [ (r + t) + (s + u) k ] is common. Let me denote this term as A:\n\nA = (r + t) + (s + u) k\n\nSimilarly, in (2b) and (2c):\n\nB = (t + p) + (u + q) k\n\nIn (3b) and (3c):\n\nC = (p + r) + (q + s) k\n\nSo, now, equations become:\n\n(1b): p A = 8\n\n(1c): q A = 4\n\n(2b): r B = 9\n\n(2c): s B = 6\n\n(3b): t C = 5\n\n(3c): u C = 10\n\nSo, from (1b) and (1c):\n\np A = 8 => p = 8 / A\n\nq A = 4 => q = 4 / A\n\nThus, p = 2 q\n\nSimilarly, from (2b) and (2c):\n\nr B = 9 => r = 9 / B\n\ns B = 6 => s = 6 / B\n\nSo, r = (9/6) s = (3/2) s\n\nFrom (3b) and (3c):\n\nt C = 5 => t = 5 / C\n\nu C = 10 => u = 10 / C\n\nSo, t = (5 /10) u = (1/2) u\n\nSo, now, we can express p, q, r, s, t, u in terms of A, B, C.\n\nBut A, B, C are functions of p, q, r, s, t, u.\n\nSo, let me write A, B, C in terms of these variables.\n\nA = (r + t) + (s + u) k\n\nBut r = (3/2) s, t = (1/2) u\n\nSo, A = ( (3/2 s) + (1/2 u) ) + (s + u) k\n\nSimilarly, B = (t + p) + (u + q) k\n\nt = (1/2) u, p = 2 q\n\nSo, B = ( (1/2 u) + 2 q ) + (u + q) k\n\nC = (p + r) + (q + s) k\n\np = 2 q, r = (3/2) s\n\nSo, C = (2 q + (3/2) s ) + (q + s) k\n\nThis is getting complicated, but maybe I can express everything in terms of q and s.\n\nBecause:\n\nFrom above:\n\np = 2 q\n\nr = (3/2) s\n\nt = (1/2) u\n\nBut u is related to C, and t is related to C as t = 5 / C, u = 10 / C.\n\nWait, but u = 10 / C, t = 5 / C. So, t = (5/10) u = 0.5 u, which matches t = (1/2) u.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express u in terms of C, and then express everything else in terms of q and s.\n\nLet me try to express A, B, C in terms of q and s.\n\nFirst, A:\n\nA = (r + t) + (s + u) k\n\nr = (3/2) s\n\nt = 5 / C\n\nu = 10 / C\n\nSo,\n\nA = ( (3/2 s) + (5 / C) ) + (s + (10 / C)) k\n\nSimilarly, B:\n\nB = (t + p) + (u + q) k\n\nt = 5 / C\n\np = 2 q\n\nu = 10 / C\n\nSo,\n\nB = ( (5 / C) + 2 q ) + ( (10 / C) + q ) k\n\nC:\n\nC = (p + r) + (q + s) k\n\np = 2 q\n\nr = (3/2) s\n\nSo,\n\nC = (2 q + (3/2 s)) + (q + s) k\n\nHmm, okay. So, now, we have expressions for A, B, C in terms of q, s, and C. But C itself depends on q and s.\n\nThis seems recursive, but perhaps I can find C first.\n\nWait, let's think about C.\n\nC = (2 q + (3/2 s)) + (q + s) k\n\nBut k = log_2 3, which is a constant. Let me denote k \u2248 1.58496, but maybe we can keep it symbolic.\n\nWait, let me see if I can express A and B in terms of C, then substitute.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write A in terms of s and C, and B in terms of q and C, then plug into their respective equations.\n\nWait, let me recall that A = (r + t) + (s + u) k\n\nAnd from earlier, A is also equal to (r + t) + (s + u) k.\n\nBut r = (3/2) s, t = 5/C, s is s, u = 10/C.\n\nSo,\n\nA = ( (3/2 s) + (5/C) ) + ( s + (10/C) ) k\n\nSimilarly, from equation (1b): p A = 8. But p = 2 q, so 2 q * A = 8 => q A = 4.\n\nBut A is expressed above in terms of q and s, but q is a variable here. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set up ratios.\n\nWait, from earlier, p = 2 q, r = 1.5 s, t = 0.5 u, u = 2 t.\n\nBut maybe let me think about the equations we have:\n\nFrom equation (1b): p A = 8, p = 2 q, so 2 q A =8 => q A =4\n\nSimilarly, from equation (2b): r B =9, r = 1.5 s, so 1.5 s B =9 => s B =6\n\nFrom equation (3b): t C =5, t=0.5 u, so 0.5 u C=5 => u C=10\n\nWait, so:\n\nq A = 4 ... (i)\n\ns B =6 ... (ii)\n\nu C =10 ... (iii)\n\nBut from equation (i): q = 4 / A\n\nFrom equation (ii): s =6 / B\n\nFrom equation (iii): u =10 / C\n\nSo, we can write everything in terms of A, B, C.\n\nBut we also have expressions for A, B, C in terms of q, s, C.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I can think differently.\n\nLet me consider the ratios of the equations.\n\nFrom equation (1b) and (1c), q = (4)/(A) and p = (8)/(A) = 2 q. So, p = 2 q.\n\nSimilarly, from (2b) and (2c), r = 9 / B and s = 6 / B, so r = (9/6) s = 1.5 s.\n\nFrom (3b) and (3c), t =5/C and u =10/C, so u = 2 t.\n\nSo, p = 2 q, r = 1.5 s, u = 2 t.\n\nNow, let's think about A, B, C.\n\nA = (r + t) + (s + u)k\n\n= (1.5 s + t) + (s + 2 t) k\n\nSimilarly, B = (t + p) + (u + q)k\n\n= (t + 2 q) + (2 t + q) k\n\nC = (p + r) + (q + s)k\n\n= (2 q + 1.5 s) + (q + s) k\n\nHmm, now, let's write A, B, C in terms of q and s, since t and u can be expressed in terms of C.\n\nWait, but t = 5/C and u = 10/C.\n\nSo, t =5/C, u=10/C.\n\nSo, A = (1.5 s + 5/C) + (s + 10/C) k\n\nSimilarly, B = (5/C + 2 q) + (10/C + q) k\n\nC = (2 q + 1.5 s) + (q + s) k\n\nSo, now, A, B, C are expressed in terms of q, s, and C.\n\nBut C is also a function of q and s.\n\nThis is recursive, but perhaps I can substitute C into the expressions for A and B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find expressions for A and B in terms of C, and then relate them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express A and B in terms of C.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nWe have:\n\nA = (1.5 s + 5/C) + (s + 10/C) k\n\nBut from C's definition: C = (2 q + 1.5 s) + (q + s) k\n\nSo, C can be written as:\n\nC = 2 q + 1.5 s + q k + s k\n\n= q(2 + k) + s(1.5 + k)\n\nSimilarly, A = 1.5 s + 5/C + s k + 10/C k\n\n= s(1.5 + k) + (5 + 10 k)/C\n\nSimilarly, B = 5/C + 2 q + 10/C k + q k\n\n= 2 q (1 + k/2) + (5 + 10 k)/C\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write A and B in terms of C and then find a relationship between them.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the equations:\n\nFrom (i): q A =4\n\nFrom (ii): s B =6\n\nFrom (iii): u C =10, but u = 10/C, so 10/C * C =10, which is 10=10, so that doesn't give new information.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express q and s in terms of A and B:\n\nq =4/A, s=6/B\n\nSo, let me substitute these into the expression for C.\n\nC = q(2 + k) + s(1.5 + k)\n\n= (4/A)(2 + k) + (6/B)(1.5 + k)\n\nSimilarly, from A's expression:\n\nA = s(1.5 + k) + (5 + 10 k)/C\n\nBut s =6/B,\n\nSo,\n\nA = (6/B)(1.5 + k) + (5 + 10 k)/C ... (A_expr)\n\nSimilarly, from B's expression:\n\nB = 2 q (1 + k/2) + (5 +10 k)/C\n\nBut q =4/A,\n\nSo,\n\nB = 2*(4/A)*(1 + k/2) + (5 +10 k)/C\n\n= (8/A)(1 + k/2) + (5 +10 k)/C ... (B_expr)\n\nSo, now, we have expressions for C, A, and B in terms of A, B, C.\n\nThis seems like a system of equations with variables A, B, C. Let me write these down.\n\nC = (4/A)(2 + k) + (6/B)(1.5 + k) ... (C_expr)\n\nA = (6/B)(1.5 + k) + (5 +10 k)/C ... (A_expr)\n\nB = (8/A)(1 + k/2) + (5 +10 k)/C ... (B_expr)\n\nHmm, this is a system of three equations with three variables A, B, C. It might be solvable.\n\nLet me denote D = (5 +10 k)/C, so that:\n\nA = (6/B)(1.5 + k) + D ... (A_expr2)\n\nB = (8/A)(1 + k/2) + D ... (B_expr2)\n\nC = (4/A)(2 + k) + (6/B)(1.5 + k) ... (C_expr2)\n\nBut D = (5 +10k)/C, so C = (5 +10k)/D.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write D in terms of C, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can subtract the expressions for A and B to eliminate D.\n\nFrom (A_expr2) and (B_expr2):\n\nA - B = [ (6/B)(1.5 + k) + D ] - [ (8/A)(1 + k/2) + D ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nA - B = (6/B)(1.5 + k) - (8/A)(1 + k/2)\n\nSo,\n\nA - B = [6(1.5 + k)/B] - [8(1 + k/2)/A]\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a ratio between A and B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can assume that A, B, C are proportional to some constants. Wait, but I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption that A, B, C are multiples of each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can attempt to express A in terms of B, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use substitution.\n\nWait, perhaps I can take the expression for D from A_expr2 and substitute into B_expr2.\n\nFrom (A_expr2):\n\nD = A - (6/B)(1.5 + k)\n\nSubstitute into (B_expr2):\n\nB = (8/A)(1 + k/2) + D\n\n= (8/A)(1 + k/2) + A - (6/B)(1.5 + k)\n\nSo,\n\nB = (8/A)(1 + k/2) + A - (6/B)(1.5 + k)\n\nMultiply both sides by A B to eliminate denominators:\n\nB * A B = 8 B (1 + k/2) + A^2 B -6 A (1.5 +k )\n\nSimplify:\n\nA B^2 = 8 B (1 + k/2) + A^2 B -6 A (1.5 +k )\n\nHmm, this seems quite involved. Maybe this is the wrong approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption to simplify.\n\nWait, perhaps I can take a step back.\n\nWe have expressions for x, y, z in terms of 2^p 3^q, etc. Maybe we can write x, y, z as products of 2 and 3 raised to some exponents, and then find the exponents based on the equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can take the initial equations and write them as:\n\nEquation 1: x^{log_2(yz)} = 2^8 3^4\n\nTake log base 2 on both sides:\n\nlog_2(x^{log_2(yz)}) = log_2(2^8 3^4)\n\nWhich is:\n\nlog_2(yz) * log_2 x = 8 + 4 log_2 3\n\nWhich is the same as equation (1a).\n\nThis is the same as the earlier approach. So, perhaps going back to the first substitution, where a = log_2 x, b = log_2 y, c = log_2 z.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nEquation (1): a(b + c) =8 +4k\n\nEquation (2): b(a + c)=9 +6k\n\nEquation (3): c(a + b)=5 +10k\n\nAnd S = a + b + c.\n\nSo, let me consider adding all three equations:\n\na(b + c) + b(a + c) + c(a + b) = (8 +4k) + (9 +6k) + (5 +10k)\n\nLeft side: a(b + c) + b(a + c) + c(a + b) = 2(ab + bc + ac)\n\nRight side: 8+9+5 +4k+6k+10k = 22 + 20k\n\nSo,\n\n2(ab + bc + ac) =22 + 20k => ab + bc + ac =11 +10k ... (7)\n\nAlso, note that:\n\nFrom equations (1), (2), (3):\n\na(b + c) =8 +4k\n\nBut b + c = S - a,\n\nSo, a(S - a) =8 +4k ... same as equation (1a)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo, perhaps I can find S.\n\nWait, if I can find S, I can solve for a, b, c.\n\nBut how?\n\nFrom equation (7):\n\nab + bc + ac =11 +10k\n\nAlso, from equations (1), (2), (3):\n\na(S - a) =8 +4k => a S - a^2 =8 +4k\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb S - b^2 =9 +6k\n\nc S -c^2 =5 +10k\n\nIf I add these three equations:\n\na S + b S + c S - (a^2 + b^2 +c^2) = 22 + 20k\n\nWhich is:\n\nS(a + b + c) - (a^2 + b^2 +c^2) =22 +20k\n\nBut a + b + c = S, so:\n\nS^2 - (a^2 + b^2 +c^2) =22 +20k\n\nBut,\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 +c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ac)\n\nSo,\n\nS^2 = (a^2 + b^2 +c^2) + 2(ab + bc + ac)\n\nFrom equation (7), ab + bc + ac =11 +10k, so:\n\nS^2 = (a^2 + b^2 +c^2) + 2*(11 +10k) = (a^2 + b^2 +c^2) +22 +20k\n\nFrom the earlier equation:\n\nS^2 - (a^2 + b^2 +c^2) =22 +20k\n\nWhich implies:\n\n(S^2 - (a^2 + b^2 +c^2)) =22 +20k\n\nBut from the other equation,\n\nS^2 - (a^2 + b^2 +c^2) =22 +20k\n\nWhich is the same as the above. So, it doesn't give new information.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find a^2 + b^2 +c^2 from equation (7):\n\nSince,\n\na^2 + b^2 +c^2 = S^2 - 2(ab + bc +ac) = S^2 - 2*(11 +10k) = S^2 -22 -20k\n\nSo, substituting back into the sum of the three equations:\n\nS^2 - (a^2 + b^2 +c^2) =22 +20k\n\nWhich becomes:\n\nS^2 - (S^2 -22 -20k) =22 +20k\n\nSimplify:\n\nS^2 - S^2 +22 +20k =22 +20k\n\nWhich is 0=0, so again, no new information.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can solve for S.\n\nWait, let me think. From equation (1a):\n\na(S -a) =8 +4k => a S -a^2 =8 +4k\n\nSimilarly, equation (2a): b S -b^2 =9 +6k\n\nEquation (3a): c S -c^2 =5 +10k\n\nSo, these are quadratic equations in a, b, c respectively.\n\nLet me write them as:\n\na^2 - a S + (8 +4k) =0 ... (1d)\n\nb^2 -b S + (9 +6k) =0 ... (2d)\n\nc^2 -c S + (5 +10k) =0 ... (3d)\n\nEach of these is a quadratic in a, b, c, with the same coefficient for the linear term, which is -S.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider a, b, c as roots of some quadratic equations?\n\nWait, but each equation is separate. Alternatively, perhaps I can find S such that these quadratics have real solutions.\n\nBut since x, y, z are positive real numbers, a, b, c are real numbers (since log_2 of positive numbers is real). So, the quadratics must have real solutions, so discriminant must be non-negative.\n\nSo, discriminant for equation (1d):\n\nD1 = S^2 -4*(8 +4k) >=0\n\nSimilarly,\n\nD2 = S^2 -4*(9 +6k) >=0\n\nD3 = S^2 -4*(5 +10k) >=0\n\nSo, the largest discriminant condition is D3 >=0, since 5+10k <9+6k <8+4k?\n\nWait, let me compute numerically.\n\nk = log_2 3 \u22481.58496\n\nCompute 8 +4k \u22488 +4*1.58496\u22488+6.33984\u224814.33984\n\n9 +6k\u22489 +6*1.58496\u22489+9.50976\u224818.50976\n\n5 +10k\u22485 +10*1.58496\u22485+15.8496\u224820.8496\n\nSo, D3 = S^2 -4*20.8496 >=0 => S^2 >=83.3984 => S >=sqrt(83.3984)\u22489.13\n\nSimilarly, D2=S^2 -4*18.50976>=0 => S^2 >=74.039 => S >=8.605\n\nD1=S^2 -4*14.33984>=0 => S^2 >=57.35936 => S >=7.574\n\nSo, the most restrictive condition is S >=9.13.\n\nSo, S must be at least approximately9.13.\n\nBut we need exact expressions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each quadratic equation (1d), (2d), (3d) has a solution.\n\nSo, for equation (1d):\n\na = [ S \u00b1 sqrt(S^2 -4*(8 +4k)) ] / 2\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nBut since a, b, c are positive real numbers, and S = a + b + c, which is positive, and we have the quadratics, perhaps I can find S such that the sum of the roots is S.\n\nWait, but for each quadratic, the sum of roots is S (since quadratic is a^2 - S a + ...).\n\nWait, no. Wait, quadratic in a is a^2 - S a + (8 +4k) =0, so sum of roots is S.\n\nBut a is one root, and the other root would be another variable? Not necessarily.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of a, b, c as each being a root of their respective quadratics.\n\nBut that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that a, b, c are such that they satisfy their respective quadratics.\n\nBut I don't see a direct way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can solve for a, b, c in terms of S.\n\nFrom equation (1d): a^2 - S a + (8 +4k)=0 => a = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S^2 -4*(8 +4k))]/2\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S^2 -4*(9 +6k))]/2\n\nc = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S^2 -4*(5 +10k))]/2\n\nBut since a, b, c are positive, we can take the positive roots.\n\nMoreover, since a, b, c are parts of S, each must be less than S.\n\nSo, the roots must be less than S, so we take the smaller roots, I think.\n\nWait, wait, for the quadratic equation ax^2 +bx +c=0, the sum of roots is -b/a. In our case, for equation (1d): a^2 - S a + (8 +4k)=0, so sum of roots is S, and product is (8 +4k). So, the two roots are a and a', where a' = S -a.\n\nBut since a is positive, and S is positive, a' would be another positive number. But in our case, a, b, c are variables, so perhaps each quadratic has only one relevant root.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a, b, c are the only roots, but that might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this approach isn't the best.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that a, b, c are the roots of the same quadratic equation, but that seems unlikely because the constants are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that a, b, c are all functions of S, and since S = a + b + c, maybe I can set up equations accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that ab + bc + ac =11 +10k.\n\nLet me compute ab + bc + ac.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nab + bc + ac =11 +10k\n\nBut I also have:\n\nFrom (1d): a^2 = S a -8 -4k\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb^2 = S b -9 -6k\n\nc^2 = S c -5 -10k\n\nSo, perhaps I can compute (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ac)\n\nSo,\n\nS^2 = (a^2 + b^2 +c^2) + 2*(11 +10k)\n\nBut from the individual equations,\n\na^2 = S a -8 -4k\n\nb^2 = S b -9 -6k\n\nc^2 = S c -5 -10k\n\nSo,\n\na^2 + b^2 +c^2 = S(a + b +c) - (8 +9 +5) -4k -6k -10k\n\n= S S -22 -20k\n\nSo,\n\nS^2 = (S^2 -22 -20k) + 2*(11 +10k)\n\nSimplify:\n\nS^2 = S^2 -22 -20k +22 +20k\n\nWhich gives S^2 = S^2, which is always true. So again, no new info.\n\nHmm, this is going in circles. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write a, b, c as follows:\n\nFrom equation (1d): a^2 = S a -8 -4k => a^2 - S a +8 +4k=0\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb^2 - S b +9 +6k=0\n\nc^2 - S c +5 +10k=0\n\nSo, perhaps I can use the fact that a, b, c are the roots of these quadratics.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that a, b, c satisfy these quadratics.\n\nWait, but each quadratic has a different constant term.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can subtract the equations to find relations between a, b, c.\n\nWait, subtract equation (1d) from equation (2d):\n\n(b^2 - S b +9 +6k) - (a^2 - S a +8 +4k)=0\n\nWhich is:\n\nb^2 -a^2 - S(b -a) + (9 -8) + (6k -4k)=0\n\nFactor:\n\n(b -a)(b + a) - S(b -a) +1 +2k=0\n\nFactor (b -a):\n\n(b -a)(b + a - S) +1 +2k=0\n\nBut S =a + b +c, so b + a - S = -c.\n\nThus,\n\n(b -a)(-c) +1 +2k=0 => -c(b -a) +1 +2k=0 => c(a -b) =1 +2k ... which is equation (4) as before.\n\nSo, same as before. So, we don't get new info.\n\nSimilarly, subtracting other equations would lead back to previous relations.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find another approach.\n\nWait, going back to the substitution where I set x =2^p 3^q etc., and found that p=2 q, r=1.5 s, u=2 t.\n\nAdditionally, we have:\n\nA = (r + t) + (s + u)k\n\n=1.5 s + t + s k + 2 t k\n\n= s(1.5 +k) + t(1 + 2k)\n\nSimilarly, from equation (1b): p A=8, p=2 q,\n\nSo, 2 q A=8 => q A=4 => q=4/A\n\nSimilarly, from equation (2b): r B=9, r=1.5 s,\n\nSo, 1.5 s B=9 => s B=6 => s=6/B\n\nFrom equation (3b): t C=5, t=0.5 u,\n\nSo, 0.5 u C=5 => u C=10 => u=10/C\n\nNow, from A's definition:\n\nA = s(1.5 +k ) + t(1 + 2k )\n\nBut s=6/B, t=5/C,\n\nSo,\n\nA = (6/B)(1.5 +k) + (5/C)(1 + 2k )\n\nSimilarly, from B's definition:\n\nB = (t + p) + (u + q)k\n\nt=5/C, p=2 q=2*(4/A)=8/A\n\nu=10/C, q=4/A\n\nSo,\n\nB = (5/C +8/A) + (10/C +4/A)k\n\nSimilarly, from C's definition:\n\nC = (p + r) + (q + s)k\n\np=8/A, r=1.5 s=1.5*(6/B)=9/B\n\nq=4/A, s=6/B\n\nSo,\n\nC = (8/A +9/B) + (4/A +6/B)k\n\nSo now, we have:\n\nA = (6/B)(1.5 +k) + (5/C)(1 + 2k ) ... (A_expr)\n\nB = (5/C +8/A) + (10/C +4/A)k ... (B_expr)\n\nC = (8/A +9/B) + (4/A +6/B)k ... (C_expr)\n\nThis is a system of three equations with three variables A, B, C.\n\nIt's quite complex, but perhaps I can make an assumption that A, B, C are proportional in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assign variables to simplify.\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s set:\n\nLet\u2019s denote M =1/A, N=1/B, P=1/C.\n\nThen,\n\nA=1/M, B=1/N, C=1/P.\n\nSubstituting into the equations:\n\nA_expr:\n\n1/M = (6*(1/N))(1.5 +k) + (5*(1/P))(1 + 2k )\n\nMultiply both sides by M N P:\n\nN P = 6 M P (1.5 +k) +5 M N (1 +2k )\n\nSimilarly,\n\nB_expr:\n\n1/N = (5*(1/P) +8*(1/M)) + (10*(1/P) +4*(1/M))k\n\nMultiply both sides by M N P:\n\nM P =5 M P +8 N P + (10k M P +4k M N )\n\nSimilarly,\n\nC_expr:\n\n1/P = (8*(1/M) +9*(1/N)) + (4*(1/M) +6*(1/N))k\n\nMultiply both sides by M N P:\n\nM N =8 M N +9 M P + (4k M N +6k M P )\n\nHmm, this is getting even more complicated, but perhaps I can see some patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can assume that A, B, C are multiples of each other. For example, suppose A = 2 B, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that A : B : C = p : q : r, some proportion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that A = m B, and C =n B, and express everything in terms of B.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me let A = m B, C =n B.\n\nSo, A =m B, C= n B.\n\nThen, substituting into the equations.\n\nFrom A_expr:\n\nA = (6/B)(1.5 +k) + (5/C)(1 + 2k )\n\nSo,\n\nm B = (6/B)(1.5 +k) + (5/(n B))(1 +2k )\n\nMultiply both sides by B:\n\nm B^2 =6 (1.5 +k ) + (5/(n ))(1 +2k )\n\nSimilarly, from B_expr:\n\nB = (5/C +8/A) + (10/C +4/A)k\n\n= (5/(n B) +8/(m B)) + (10/(n B) +4/(m B))k\n\nFactor 1/B:\n\nB = [5/n +8/m + (10/n +4/m )k ] / B\n\nMultiply both sides by B:\n\nB^2 =5/n +8/m + (10/n +4/m )k\n\nSimilarly, from C_expr:\n\nC = (8/A +9/B) + (4/A +6/B )k\n\n= (8/(m B) +9/B ) + (4/(m B ) +6/B )k\n\nFactor 1/B:\n\nC = [8/m +9 + (4/m +6 )k ] / B\n\nBut C =n B,\n\nSo,\n\nn B = [8/m +9 + (4/m +6 )k ] / B\n\nMultiply both sides by B:\n\nn B^2 =8/m +9 + (4/m +6 )k\n\nSo now, we have three equations:\n\n1. m B^2 =6(1.5 +k ) +5/n (1 +2k ) ... (I)\n2. B^2 =5/n +8/m + (10/n +4/m )k ... (II)\n3. n B^2 =8/m +9 + (4/m +6 )k ... (III)\n\nThis is a system with variables m, n, B.\n\nThis is getting really involved, but perhaps I can make some intelligent substitutions.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me denote equation II as:\n\nB^2 = (5/n +8/m ) + (10/n +4/m )k ... (II)\n\nSimilarly, equation I:\n\nm B^2 =9 +6k +5/n +10k/n ... (I)\n\nEquation III:\n\nn B^2 =8/m +9 +4k/m +6k ... (III)\n\nWait, perhaps I can express equation I as:\n\nm B^2 =9 +6k +5/n +10k/n\n\nBut from equation II, B^2 is expressed as:\n\nB^2 =5/n +8/m +10k/n +4k/m\n\nSo, m B^2 = m*(5/n +8/m +10k/n +4k/m )\n\n=5 m /n +8 +10k m /n +4k\n\nBut from equation I, m B^2 =9 +6k +5/n +10k/n\n\nThus,\n\n5 m /n +8 +10k m /n +4k =9 +6k +5/n +10k/n\n\nRearrange terms:\n\n(5 m /n -5/n ) + (10k m /n -10k /n ) + (8 +4k -9 -6k )=0\n\nFactor:\n\n5/n (m -1) +10k /n (m -1) + (-1 -2k )=0\n\nFactor (m -1):\n\n(m -1)(5/n +10k /n ) -1 -2k =0\n\nFactor 5/n (1 +2k ):\n\n(m -1)(5(1 +2k)/n ) - (1 +2k )=0\n\nFactor (1 +2k ):\n\n(1 +2k )[ (m -1)(5/n ) -1 ]=0\n\nSince 1 +2k is not zero (k\u22481.58496, so 1+2k\u22484.16992), we have:\n\n(m -1)(5/n ) -1 =0 => (m -1)(5/n )=1 => (m -1)= n /5\n\nSo,\n\nm =1 +n /5 ...

from the initial substitution, x=2^{p }3^{q }, y=2^{r }3^{s }, z=2^{t }3^{u }.\n\nBut when I found a=log_2 x=2, that implies x=4=2^2, regardless of the 3^{q } term.\n\nThus, x=4 implies q=0, but earlier, q=2/(2 +k )\u22600.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nThus, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused log_2 x with p.\n\nWait, no, x=2^{p }3^{q }, so log_2 x=p +q log_2 3.\n\nBut we found log_2 x=2, so:\n\np + q log_2 3=2\n\nSimilarly, from earlier, p=4/(2 +k ), q=2/(2 +k )\n\nThus,\n\n4/(2 +k ) + [2/(2 +k ) ]*k=4/(2 +k ) +2k/(2 +k )=(4 +2k )/(2 +k )=2*(2 +k )/(2 +k )=2\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, x=2^{p }3^{q }=4 *3^{2/(2 +k ) }\n\nSimilarly, y=8 *3^{6/(2k +3 ) }\n\nz=18.\n\nBut when I computed a=log_2 x=2, that's independent of the 3^{q } term.\n\nThus, x=4, but also x=4 *3^{2/(2 +k ) }, implying that 3^{2/(2 +k ) }=1, which is only possible if 2/(2 +k )=0, which is not the case.\n\nThus, contradiction arises, meaning that my earlier assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express variables.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused log_2 x with p.\n\nWait, no, x=2^p 3^q, so log_2 x=p + q log_2 3.\n\nThus, a=log_2 x=p +q log_2 3=2.\n\nWhich is correct, as we have p=4/(2 +k ), q=2/(2 +k )\n\nThus, a=4/(2 +k ) +2k/(2 +k )= (4 +2k )/(2 +k )=2.\n\nThus, a=2.\n\nSimilarly, b=3, c=1 +2k.\n\nThus, x=2^{p }3^{q }=2^{4/(2 +k ) }3^{2/(2 +k ) }, y=2^{9/(2k +3 ) }3^{6/(2k +3 ) }, z=2^1 3^2=18.\n\nThus, x, y, z are as above, and xyz= x y z= [2^{4/(2 +k ) }3^{2/(2 +k ) } ] * [2^{9/(2k +3 ) }3^{6/(2k +3 ) } ] * [2^1 3^2 ]\n\nThus,\n\nxyz=2^{4/(2 +k ) +9/(2k +3 ) +1 } *3^{2/(2 +k ) +6/(2k +3 ) +2 }\n\nBut earlier, we found:\n\nExponent of2:4/(2 +k ) +9/(2k +3 ) +1= [4(2k +3 ) +9(2 +k ) + (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ] / [ (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ]\n\nWait, no, perhaps compute numerator:\n\n4/(2 +k ) +9/(2k +3 ) +1= [4(2k +3 ) +9(2 +k ) + (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ] / [ (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ]\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n4*(2k +3 )=8k +12\n\n9*(2 +k )=18 +9k\n\n(2 +k )(2k +3 )=4k +6 +2k^2 +3k=2k^2 +7k +6\n\nTotal numerator:8k +12 +18 +9k +2k^2 +7k +6=2k^2 +24k +36\n\nDenominator: (2 +k )(2k +3 )=2k^2 +7k +6\n\nThus,\n\nExponent of2= (2k^2 +24k +36 )/(2k^2 +7k +6 )=2*(k^2 +12k +18 )/(2k^2 +7k +6 )\n\nSimilarly, exponent of3:\n\n2/(2 +k ) +6/(2k +3 ) +2= [2(2k +3 ) +6(2 +k ) +2*(2 +k )(2k +3 ) ] / [ (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ]\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n2*(2k +3 )=4k +6\n\n6*(2 +k )=12 +6k\n\n2*(2 +k )(2k +3 )=2*(4k +6 +2k^2 +3k )=2*(2k^2 +7k +6 )=4k^2 +14k +12\n\nTotal numerator:4k +6 +12 +6k +4k^2 +14k +12=4k^2 +24k +30\n\nDenominator: (2 +k )(2k +3 )=2k^2 +7k +6\n\nThus,\n\nExponent of3= (4k^2 +24k +30 )/(2k^2 +7k +6 )=2*(2k^2 +12k +15 )/(2k^2 +7k +6 )\n\nThus,\n\nxyz=2^{ (2k^2 +24k +36 )/(2k^2 +7k +6 ) } *3^{ (4k^2 +24k +30 )/(2k^2 +7k +6 ) }\n\nBut notice that:\n\n(4k^2 +24k +30 )=2*(2k^2 +12k +15 )\n\n(2k^2 +24k +36 )=2*(k^2 +12k +18 )\n\nBut no further simplification.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nLet me write:\n\nxyz= [2^{2k^2 +24k +36 } *3^{4k^2 +24k +30 } ]^{1/(2k^2 +7k +6 ) }\n\nBut not helpful.\n\nThus, the minimal value is 2^{ (2k^2 +24k +36 )/(2k^2 +7k +6 ) } *3^{ (4k^2 +24k +30 )/(2k^2 +7k +6 ) }\n\nBut as a numerical value, it's approximately 576 *3^{1.53 }\u2248576*5.37\u22483093.\n\nBut the problem asks for the smallest possible value, which is likely an integer.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps the minimal value is 2160, but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, but given that x=4, y=8, z=18, then xyz=4*8*18=576.\n\nBut earlier, I thought x=4, but x also includes a factor of 3^{2/(2 +k ) }, which is not 1.\n\nThus, x is not 4, but 4 *3^{2/(2 +k ) }.\n\nThus, x, y, z are not integers, but their product is 576 *3^{ [10k +18 ] / [2k^2 +7k +6 ] }\n\nWhich is approximately 3093, but exact value is complicated.\n\nBut given that the problem asks for the minimal possible value, and our substitutions led to x, y, z uniquely, I think the minimal value is 576 *3^{ [10k +18 ] / [2k^2 +7k +6 ] }, but since this is complicated, perhaps the minimal value is 2160.\n\nBut I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that:\n\nFrom xyz=2^{6 } *3^{ something }, which is 64 *3^{something }, but I don't know.\n\nBut I think the minimal value is 2160, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but let me think differently.\n\nWait, since x, y, z are positive reals, and the equations are symmetric, perhaps we can set x=2^{a }3^{b }, y=2^{c }3^{d }, z=2^{e }3^{f }\n\nThen, perhaps a +c +e = log_2(x y z ), similarly for exponents of3.\n\nWait, but perhaps this is the same as earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since x, y, z are uniquely determined, xyz is fixed, so the minimal value is the computed value.\n\nThus, the minimal value is xyz=2^{ [2k^2 +24k +36 ]/[2k^2 +7k +6 ] } *3^{ [4k^2 +24k +30 ]/[2k^2 +7k +6 ] }\n\nBut since k=log_2 3, and the problem requires the minimal value, perhaps the answer is 2160.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal value is 2160.\n\nWait, but 2160=2^4 *3^3 *5.\n\nBut in our case, xyz=2^{exponent2 } *3^{exponent3 }, where exponents are as above.\n\nThus, unless exponents are integers, xyz won't be an integer.\n\nBut given that the exponents are not integers, xyz is not an integer.\n\nThus, since the problem asks for the minimal possible value, it's likely 2160, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal value is 2160, but given the complexity, I think the answer is 2160.\n\nBut to be precise, I think the minimal value is 2160.\n\nBut actually, wait, when I computed x=4, y=8, z=18, xyz=576, which is less than 2160, but x, y, z are not integers.\n\nThus, the minimal value is 576, but that's incorrect because x, y, z have factors of3.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal value is 576, but I think I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no, when I computed x=4 *3^{2/(2 +k ) }, y=8 *3^{6/(2k +3 ) }, z=18.\n\nThus, xyz=4*8*18 *3^{2/(2 +k ) +6/(2k +3 ) }=576 *3^{ [2(2 +k ) +6 ] / [ (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ] }\n\nWait, no, 2/(2 +k ) +6/(2k +3 )= [2(2k +3 ) +6(2 +k ) ] / [ (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ]= [4k +6 +12 +6k ] / [ (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ]= [10k +18 ] / [ (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ]\n\nThus,\n\nxyz=576 *3^{ (10k +18 ) / [ (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ] }\n\nBut (10k +18 )=(2 +k )(5 ) +8, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute:\n\n(10k +18 ) / [ (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ]= [10k +18 ] / [4k +6 +2k^2 +3k ]= [10k +18 ] / [2k^2 +7k +6 ]\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nThus, xyz=576 *3^{ [10k +18 ] / [2k^2 +7k +6 ] }.\n\nBut I can\u2019t simplify this further, so I think the minimal value is 576 multiplied by3 raised to that exponent, which is approximately 3093.\n\nBut the problem expects an exact value, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, going back, when I solved for A, B, C, I found A=2(2 +k ), B=2k +3, C=5.\n\nThus,\n\nq=4/A=4/[2(2 +k ) ]=2/(2 +k )\n\nSimilarly,\n\ns=6/B=6/(2k +3 )\n\nu=10/C=2\n\nThus,\n\nq +s +u=2/(2 +k ) +6/(2k +3 ) +2\n\nLet me compute:\n\n= [2(2k +3 ) +6(2 +k ) ] / [ (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ] +2\n\n= [4k +6 +12 +6k ] / [ (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ] +2\n\n= [10k +18 ] / [ (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ] +2\n\n= [10k +18 +2(2 +k )(2k +3 ) ] / [ (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ]\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n10k +18 +2*(4k +6 +2k^2 +3k )=10k +18 +8k +12 +4k^2 +6k=4k^2 +24k +30\n\nThus,\n\nq +s +u= (4k^2 +24k +30 ) / [ (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ]\n\nSimilarly,\n\np +r +t=4/(2 +k ) +9/(2k +3 ) +1= [4(2k +3 ) +9(2 +k ) + (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ] / [ (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ]\n\n= [8k +12 +18 +9k +4k^2 +7k +6 ] / [ ... ]= [4k^2 +24k +36 ] / [ ... ]\n\nThus,\n\nxyz=2^{ (4k^2 +24k +36 ) / [ (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ] } *3^{ (4k^2 +24k +30 ) / [ (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ] }\n\nBut (4k^2 +24k +36 )=4(k^2 +6k +9 )=4(k +3 )^2\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(4k^2 +24k +30 )=4k^2 +24k +30\n\nDenominator=(2 +k )(2k +3 )\n\nBut I don't see a way to write exponents as integers.\n\nThus, I think the minimal value is xyz=2^{4(k +3 )^2 / [ (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ] } *3^{ (4k^2 +24k +30 ) / [ (2 +k )(2k +3 ) ] }\n\nBut since this is complicated, I think the answer is 2160, but I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute:\n\nLet me compute:\n\nExponent for2: [4k^2 +24k +36 ]/[2k^2 +7k +6 ]= [4(k^2 +6k +9 ) ]/[2k^2 +7k +6 ]=4(k +3 )^2 / [ (2k +3 )(k +2 ) ]\n\nExponent for3: [4k^2 +24k +30 ]/[2k^2 +7k +6 ]\n\nBut I don't see a way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps cross-multiplied:\n\nLet me compute 4(k +3 )^2=4k^2 +24k +36\n\nDenominator=2k^2 +7k +6\n\nThus,\n\nExponent for2= [4k^2 +24k +36 ]/[2k^2 +7k +6 ]=2*[2k^2 +12k +18 ]/[2k^2 +7k +6 ]\n\nBut no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps recognize that 2k^2 +7k +6=(2k +3 )(k +2 )\n\nThus,\n\nExponent for2=4(k +3 )^2 / [ (2k +3 )(k +2 ) ]\n\nExponent for3= [4k^2 +24k +30 ]/[ (2k +3 )(k +2 ) ]\n\nThus,\n\nxyz=2^{4(k +3 )^2 / [ (2k +3 )(k +2 ) ] } *3^{ [4k^2 +24k +30 ] / [ (2k +3 )(k +2 ) ] }\n\nBut I don't see a way to make this an integer.\n\nThus, I think the minimal value is 2160, but I'm not sure.\n\nBut given that x=4, y=8, z=18, then xyz=576, but that\u2019s incorrect because x includes a factor of3^{2/(2 +k ) }, which is not 1.
