      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the two possible values of a + b + c, given that a, b, and c are pairwise distinct complex numbers satisfying the equations:\n\na\u00b2 = b + 6  \nb\u00b2 = c + 6  \nc\u00b2 = a + 6\n\nHmm, interesting. So each variable is related to the next in a cycle. Since they are pairwise distinct, I can't assume any of them are equal. I need to find a way to relate all three variables together.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can substitute each equation into the next. Let's see.\n\nStarting with the first equation: a\u00b2 = b + 6. So, b = a\u00b2 - 6.\n\nThen, substitute this into the second equation: b\u00b2 = c + 6. So, (a\u00b2 - 6)\u00b2 = c + 6. That gives c = (a\u00b2 - 6)\u00b2 - 6.\n\nNow, substitute this expression for c into the third equation: c\u00b2 = a + 6.\n\nSo, [(a\u00b2 - 6)\u00b2 - 6]\u00b2 = a + 6.\n\nWhoa, that seems complicated. Let me write that out step by step.\n\nFirst, find b in terms of a:\nb = a\u00b2 - 6\n\nThen, find c in terms of a:\nc = (a\u00b2 - 6)\u00b2 - 6\n\nNow, substitute c into c\u00b2 = a + 6:\n[(a\u00b2 - 6)\u00b2 - 6]\u00b2 = a + 6\n\nSo that's a big equation in terms of a. Let me denote S = a + b + c. Maybe if I can express S in terms of a, I can find an equation for S.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWe have a, b, c in terms of a:\n\nb = a\u00b2 - 6  \nc = (a\u00b2 - 6)^2 - 6\n\nSo, S = a + (a\u00b2 - 6) + [(a\u00b2 - 6)^2 - 6]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, compute (a\u00b2 - 6)^2:\n\n(a\u00b2 - 6)^2 = a^4 - 12a\u00b2 + 36\n\nSo, c = (a^4 - 12a\u00b2 + 36) - 6 = a^4 - 12a\u00b2 + 30\n\nTherefore, S = a + (a\u00b2 - 6) + (a^4 - 12a\u00b2 + 30)\n\nLet me compute that term by term:\n\na + a\u00b2 - 6 + a^4 - 12a\u00b2 + 30\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na^4 + (a\u00b2 - 12a\u00b2) + a + (-6 + 30)\n\nSimplifying:\n\na^4 - 11a\u00b2 + a + 24\n\nSo, S = a^4 - 11a\u00b2 + a + 24\n\nBut I don't know if that helps directly. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the three equations and subtract them or add them in some way.\n\nLet me write down the three equations:\n\n1) a\u00b2 = b + 6  \n2) b\u00b2 = c + 6  \n3) c\u00b2 = a + 6\n\nIf I add all three equations together:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (b + 6) + (c + 6) + (a + 6)  \na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = a + b + c + 18\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c. So, the equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S + 18\n\nHmm, I also know that (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, maybe I can relate a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 to S.\n\nCompute (S)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)\n\nFrom the earlier equation, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S + 18. So, substitute that into S\u00b2:\n\nS\u00b2 = (S + 18) + 2(ab + bc + ca)  \n=> 2(ab + bc + ca) = S\u00b2 - S - 18\n\nSo, if I can find ab + bc + ca, I can relate it to S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find ab + bc + ca in terms of S.\n\nLet me think about the given equations again.\n\nFrom equation 1: a\u00b2 = b + 6 => b = a\u00b2 -6  \nFrom equation 2: b\u00b2 = c +6 => c = b\u00b2 -6  \nFrom equation 3: c\u00b2 = a +6 => a = c\u00b2 -6\n\nSo, we can express each variable in terms of the next. Maybe I can substitute these into each other.\n\nLet me try to write a in terms of b, then b in terms of c, and c in terms of a.\n\nFrom equation 1: a\u00b2 = b +6 => a = sqrt(b +6). But since we're dealing with complex numbers, square roots might introduce complications, but maybe we can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, let me express each variable in terms of the previous.\n\nWait, another thought: if I substitute each equation into the next, perhaps I can get a single equation in terms of a.\n\nWait, I already tried that earlier, and it led to the equation [(a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6]^2 = a +6, which is a degree 8 equation. That seems too high, but perhaps I can factor it or find a relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the differences between the equations.\n\nWait, let's subtract the first equation from the second.\n\nEquation 2 minus equation 1: b\u00b2 - a\u00b2 = c +6 - (b +6)  \nb\u00b2 - a\u00b2 = c - b  \nFactor left side: (b - a)(b + a) = c - b  \nSo, (b - a)(b + a) = -(b - c)\n\nSimilarly, maybe do equation 3 minus equation 2: c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = a +6 - (c +6)  \nc\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = a - c  \nFactor left side: (c - b)(c + b) = a - c  \nSo, (c - b)(c + b) = -(c - a)\n\nAnd then equation 1 minus equation 3: a\u00b2 - c\u00b2 = b +6 - (a +6)  \na\u00b2 - c\u00b2 = b - a  \nFactor left side: (a - c)(a + c) = b - a  \nSo, (a - c)(a + c) = -(a - b)\n\nHmm, now I have these three equations:\n\n1) (b - a)(b + a) = -(b - c)  \n2) (c - b)(c + b) = -(c - a)  \n3) (a - c)(a + c) = -(a - b)\n\nLet me write them as:\n\n1) (b - a)(b + a) + (b - c) = 0  \n2) (c - b)(c + b) + (c - a) = 0  \n3) (a - c)(a + c) + (a - b) = 0\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor these terms. Let me consider each equation.\n\nLooking at equation 1: (b - a)(b + a) = -(b - c)  \nLet me rearrange: (b - a)(b + a) + (b - c) = 0  \nFactor (b - a) and (b - c):\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write each equation as:\n\nFrom equation 1: (b - a)(b + a) = -(b - c)  \nSo, (b - a)(b + a) + (b - c) = 0  \nBut I don't see an obvious way to factor this.\n\nWait, perhaps if I factor out (b - a) from the first two terms.\n\nWait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps divide both sides by (b - a), assuming b \u2260 a (since they are distinct), so we get:\n\n(b + a) = [-(b - c)] / (b - a)  \n= (c - b)/(b - a)  \n= -(b - c)/(b - a)\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express (c - b) in terms of (b - a):\n\nFrom equation 1, (b - a)(b + a) = -(b - c)  \nSo, (b - c) = -(b - a)(b + a)\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2:\n\n(c - b)(c + b) = -(c - a)  \nBut (c - b) = (b - c) = -(b - a)(b + a) from equation 1.\n\nSubstituting into equation 2:\n\n[-(b - a)(b + a)] (c + b) = -(c - a)\n\nSo,\n\n-(b - a)(b + a)(c + b) = -(c - a)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n(b - a)(b + a)(c + b) = c - a\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy, but perhaps I can factor (c - a) on the right side.\n\nWait, c - a = -(a - c)\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor c - a as (c - b) + (b - a), but I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express (c + b) as another variable.\n\nThis seems getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nLet me try to express everything in terms of S = a + b + c.\n\nWait, from earlier, I have S = a + b + c. Let me see if I can find another equation involving S.\n\nFrom the three equations:\n\na\u00b2 = b +6  \nb\u00b2 = c +6  \nc\u00b2 = a +6\n\nLet me add them: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c) + 18  \nSo, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S + 18\n\nAlso, as I thought before, S\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)\n\nSo substituting:\n\nS\u00b2 = (S + 18) + 2(ab + bc + ca)  \nSo, 2(ab + bc + ca) = S\u00b2 - S - 18\n\nSo, if I can find ab + bc + ca in terms of S, that might help.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute ab + bc + ca.\n\nFrom the given equations:\n\na\u00b2 = b +6  \nb\u00b2 = c +6  \nc\u00b2 = a +6\n\nLet me multiply all three equations together:\n\na\u00b2 * b\u00b2 * c\u00b2 = (b +6)(c +6)(a +6)\n\nLeft side: (abc)^2\n\nRight side: (b +6)(c +6)(a +6)  \n= (a +6)(b +6)(c +6)\n\nSo, (abc)^2 = (a +6)(b +6)(c +6)\n\nHmm, that's another equation. Let me denote P = abc.\n\nSo, P\u00b2 = (a +6)(b +6)(c +6)\n\nBut I also know that (a +6) = c\u00b2, from equation 3.\n\nSimilarly, (b +6) = a\u00b2, from equation 1.\n\nAnd (c +6) = b\u00b2, from equation 2.\n\nTherefore, (a +6)(b +6)(c +6) = c\u00b2 * a\u00b2 * b\u00b2 = (abc)^2 = P\u00b2\n\nSo, we get P\u00b2 = P\u00b2, which is an identity, so that doesn't give new information.\n\nHmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider ab + bc + ca.\n\nFrom the given equations, let me try to compute ab + bc + ca.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom a\u00b2 = b +6 => b = a\u00b2 -6  \nSimilarly, c = b\u00b2 -6 = (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6  \nAnd a = c\u00b2 -6 = [ (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 ]^2 -6\n\nWait, that's a high-degree equation in a, which might be difficult to solve. But perhaps I can consider that a is a root of this equation, and maybe it's related to S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that a, b, c are roots of a cubic equation.\n\nWait, that's a good idea. Let me think.\n\nSuppose a, b, c are roots of the cubic equation x\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + Qx - P = 0, where S = a + b + c, Q = ab + bc + ca, P = abc.\n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\na\u00b2 = b +6  \nb\u00b2 = c +6  \nc\u00b2 = a +6\n\nLet me try to find expressions for Q and P.\n\nWait, from the equations:\n\na\u00b2 = b +6  \nSo, a\u00b2 - b = 6  \nSimilarly, b\u00b2 - c =6  \nc\u00b2 - a =6\n\nSo, adding these:\n\n(a\u00b2 - b) + (b\u00b2 - c) + (c\u00b2 - a) = 18  \nWhich gives:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (a + b + c) = 18  \nWhich is consistent with what we had before, that a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S + 18.\n\nSo, nothing new there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute Q = ab + bc + ca.\n\nLet me think about computing ab + bc + ca.\n\nFrom a\u00b2 = b +6, so b = a\u00b2 -6\n\nSimilarly, c = b\u00b2 -6 = (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6\n\nSo, let me compute ab:\n\nab = a*(a\u00b2 -6) = a\u00b3 -6a\n\nSimilarly, compute bc:\n\nb = a\u00b2 -6  \nc = (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6  \nSo, bc = (a\u00b2 -6) * [ (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 ]  \n= (a\u00b2 -6)^3 -6(a\u00b2 -6)\n\nAnd compute ca:\n\nc = (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6  \na = a  \nSo, ca = a * [ (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 ]  \n= a*(a^4 -12a\u00b2 +36 -6)  \n= a*(a^4 -12a\u00b2 +30)  \n= a^5 -12a\u00b3 +30a\n\nSo, Q = ab + bc + ca  \n= (a\u00b3 -6a) + [ (a\u00b2 -6)^3 -6(a\u00b2 -6) ] + [ a^5 -12a\u00b3 +30a ]\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nFirst, expand (a\u00b2 -6)^3:\n\n= (a\u00b2)^3 - 3*(a\u00b2)^2*6 + 3*a\u00b2*(6)^2 - (6)^3  \n= a^6 - 18a^4 + 108a\u00b2 - 216\n\nSo, bc = (a^6 - 18a^4 + 108a\u00b2 - 216) -6a\u00b2 +36  \n= a^6 - 18a^4 + 108a\u00b2 -216 -6a\u00b2 +36  \n= a^6 -18a^4 +102a\u00b2 -180\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nQ = (a\u00b3 -6a) + (a^6 -18a^4 +102a\u00b2 -180) + (a^5 -12a\u00b3 +30a)\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\na^6 + a^5 + (a\u00b3 -12a\u00b3) + (-18a^4) + (102a\u00b2) + (-6a +30a) + (-180)\n\nSimplify each term:\n\na^6  \n+ a^5  \n+ (-11a\u00b3)  \n-18a^4  \n+102a\u00b2  \n+24a  \n-180\n\nSo, Q = a^6 + a^5 -18a^4 -11a\u00b3 +102a\u00b2 +24a -180\n\nHmm, that seems too complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the best.\n\nPerhaps I should try a different method. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: since the equations are cyclic, perhaps I can assume that a, b, c form a cycle, so maybe I can write a function f(x) such that f(a) = b, f(b) = c, f(c) = a. Then, f(f(f(a))) = a.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nDefine f(x) = x\u00b2 -6. Then, according to the given equations:\n\nb = f(a)  \nc = f(b) = f(f(a))  \na = f(c) = f(f(f(a)))\n\nSo, a = f(f(f(a)))\n\nTherefore, a is a fixed point of the function f composed three times.\n\nSo, f(f(f(a))) = a  \nWhich is: f(f(f(a))) - a = 0\n\nLet me compute f(f(f(a))):\n\nFirst, f(a) = a\u00b2 -6  \nf(f(a)) = f(a\u00b2 -6) = (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6  \nf(f(f(a))) = f( (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 )  \n= [ ( (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 ) ]\u00b2 -6\n\nSo, f(f(f(a))) = [ (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 ]\u00b2 -6\n\nSet this equal to a:\n\n[ (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 ]\u00b2 -6 = a\n\nWhich is the same equation I got earlier: [(a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6]^2 = a +6\n\nSo, expanding this, we have:\n\nLet me denote y = a\u00b2 -6  \nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n(y\u00b2 -6)^2 = a +6  \nBut y = a\u00b2 -6, so substitute back:\n\n[ (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 ]^2 = a +6\n\nLet me compute (a\u00b2 -6)^2:\n\n(a\u00b2 -6)^2 = a^4 -12a\u00b2 +36\n\nSo, (a^4 -12a\u00b2 +36) -6 = a^4 -12a\u00b2 +30\n\nSo, (a^4 -12a\u00b2 +30)^2 = a +6\n\nExpanding (a^4 -12a\u00b2 +30)^2:\n\n= (a^4)^2 + (-12a\u00b2)^2 + (30)^2 + 2*(a^4*(-12a\u00b2) + a^4*30 + (-12a\u00b2)*30 )\n\nWait, better to compute it step by step.\n\n(a^4 -12a\u00b2 +30)(a^4 -12a\u00b2 +30)\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst, a^4 * a^4 = a^8  \na^4 * (-12a\u00b2) = -12a^6  \na^4 *30 =30a^4  \n(-12a\u00b2)*a^4 = -12a^6  \n(-12a\u00b2)*(-12a\u00b2)=144a^4  \n(-12a\u00b2)*30= -360a\u00b2  \n30*a^4=30a^4  \n30*(-12a\u00b2)= -360a\u00b2  \n30*30=900\n\nNow, add all these terms together:\n\na^8  \n+ (-12a^6 -12a^6)  \n+ (30a^4 +144a^4 +30a^4)  \n+ (-360a\u00b2 -360a\u00b2)  \n+ 900\n\nSimplify:\n\na^8  \n-24a^6  \n+204a^4  \n-720a\u00b2  \n+900\n\nSo, (a^4 -12a\u00b2 +30)^2 = a^8 -24a^6 +204a^4 -720a\u00b2 +900\n\nSet equal to a +6:\n\na^8 -24a^6 +204a^4 -720a\u00b2 +900 = a +6  \nSo, a^8 -24a^6 +204a^4 -720a\u00b2 -a +894 = 0\n\nThat's an eighth-degree equation. Solving this seems daunting, but perhaps it can be factored.\n\nLet me check if a = 3 is a root:\n\nPlug a=3:\n\n3^8 -24*3^6 +204*3^4 -720*3^2 -3 +894  \n=6561 -24*729 +204*81 -720*9 -3 +894  \nCompute each term:\n\n6561  \n-24*729 = -17,496  \n204*81 = 16,524  \n-720*9 = -6,480  \n-3  \n+894\n\nAdding them up:\n\n6561 -17,496 = -10,935  \n-10,935 +16,524 =5,589  \n5,589 -6,480 =-891  \n-891 -3 =-894  \n-894 +894=0\n\nSo, a=3 is a root. So, (a -3) is a factor.\n\nSimilarly, check a= -3:\n\n(-3)^8 -24*(-3)^6 +204*(-3)^4 -720*(-3)^2 -(-3) +894  \n=6561 -24*729 +204*81 -720*9 +3 +894  \nCompute each term:\n\n6561  \n-24*729= -17,496  \n204*81=16,524  \n-720*9 =-6,480  \n+3  \n+894\n\nAdding:\n\n6561 -17,496 = -10,935  \n-10,935 +16,524=5,589  \n5,589 -6,480= -891  \n-891 +3= -888  \n-888 +894=6 \u22600\n\nSo, a=-3 is not a root.\n\nSimilarly, let's check a=2:\n\n2^8 -24*2^6 +204*2^4 -720*2^2 -2 +894  \n=256 -24*64 +204*16 -720*4 -2 +894  \n=256 -1,536 +3,264 -2,880 -2 +894  \nCompute step by step:\n\n256 -1,536 = -1,280  \n-1,280 +3,264 =1,984  \n1,984 -2,880 =-896  \n-896 -2 =-898  \n-898 +894= -4 \u22600\n\nNot a root.\n\nHow about a=1:\n\n1^8 -24*1^6 +204*1^4 -720*1^2 -1 +894  \n=1 -24 +204 -720 -1 +894  \n= (1 -24) = -23  \n-23 +204 = 181  \n181 -720 = -539  \n-539 -1 =-540  \n-540 +894= 354 \u22600\n\nNot a root.\n\na= sqrt( something )? Not sure.\n\nBut at least we have a=3 is a root. So, we can factor (a -3) out.\n\nLet me perform polynomial division to factor out (a -3) from the eighth-degree polynomial.\n\nWait, the polynomial is:\n\na^8 -24a^6 +204a^4 -720a\u00b2 -a +894\n\nDivide by (a -3). Hmm, long division might be tedious, but perhaps synthetic division.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write the polynomial as:\n\n(a -3)(something) = a^8 -24a^6 +204a^4 -720a\u00b2 -a +894\n\nLet me set up the division.\n\nLet me denote P(a) = a^8 -24a^6 +204a^4 -720a\u00b2 -a +894\n\nWe know a=3 is a root, so we can divide P(a) by (a -3). Since it's a degree 8 polynomial, the quotient will be degree 7. But this is time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can factor the polynomial as (a -3)(a^7 + ... )\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation has other roots related to a=3.\n\nWait, let me think about the original problem. Since a, b, c are pairwise distinct, so a, b, c are all different.\n\nIf a=3, then let's compute b and c.\n\nFrom a=3:\n\nb = a\u00b2 -6 = 9 -6 =3\n\nBut then b=3, same as a=3, which contradicts the condition that a, b, c are pairwise distinct.\n\nSo, a=3 is a root, but when a=3, b=3, which is not allowed because they must be distinct. So, even though a=3 is a root of the equation, it's not acceptable because it violates the distinctness condition.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the minimal equation we need is of lower degree, considering a, b, c are distinct.\n\nHmm, another thought: perhaps the sum S = a + b + c can be found without knowing the exact values of a, b, c.\n\nEarlier, I had S = a + b + c = a + (a\u00b2 -6) + [(a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6]\n\nWhich simplifies to S = a^4 -11a\u00b2 + a +24\n\nBut S is also a + b + c, so I can write S = a + (a\u00b2 -6) + ( (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 )\n\nAs above.\n\nWait, maybe I can express S in terms of itself.\n\nWait, let me compute S = a + b + c  \nBut b = a\u00b2 -6  \nc = b\u00b2 -6 = (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6  \nSo, S = a + (a\u00b2 -6) + [(a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6]  \n= a + a\u00b2 -6 + (a^4 -12a\u00b2 +36) -6  \n= a + a\u00b2 -6 + a^4 -12a\u00b2 +36 -6  \nCombine like terms:\n\na^4 + (a\u00b2 -12a\u00b2) + a + (-6 +36 -6)  \n= a^4 -11a\u00b2 +a +24\n\nSo, S = a^4 -11a\u00b2 +a +24\n\nBut S is also equal to a + b + c.\n\nWait, but from the equations, I also have:\n\na\u00b2 = b +6  \nb\u00b2 = c +6  \nc\u00b2 = a +6\n\nLet me add these: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c) +18  \nWhich is: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S +18\n\nAlso, from the identity: (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)  \nSo, S\u00b2 = (S +18) + 2(ab + bc + ca)  \nSo, 2(ab + bc + ca) = S\u00b2 - S -18\n\nBut I also have another equation involving ab + bc + ca.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find another way to express ab + bc + ca.\n\nWait, from earlier:\n\nab + bc + ca = ?\n\nI know that:\n\na\u00b2 = b +6  \nMultiply both sides by b: a\u00b2b = b\u00b2 +6b  \nBut b\u00b2 = c +6, so a\u00b2b = (c +6) +6b = c +6 +6b\n\nSimilarly, from b\u00b2 = c +6, multiply both sides by c: b\u00b2c = c\u00b2 +6c  \nBut c\u00b2 = a +6, so b\u00b2c = (a +6) +6c = a +6 +6c\n\nSimilarly, from c\u00b2 = a +6, multiply both sides by a: c\u00b2a = a\u00b2 +6a  \nBut a\u00b2 = b +6, so c\u00b2a = (b +6) +6a = b +6 +6a\n\nNow, let me add these three equations:\n\na\u00b2b + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a = (c +6 +6b) + (a +6 +6c) + (b +6 +6a)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\nc +6 +6b +a +6 +6c +b +6 +6a  \n= (a +6a) + (b +6b) + (c +6c) +6 +6 +6  \n=7a +7b +7c +18  \n=7(a + b + c) +18  \n=7S +18\n\nSo, a\u00b2b + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a =7S +18\n\nBut from earlier:\n\nFrom a\u00b2b = c +6 +6b  \nSimilarly, adding all three gives the above.\n\nBut I don't see a direct way to relate this to S.\n\nWait, perhaps I can relate a\u00b2b + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a to ab + bc + ca.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the expressions.\n\nWait, from a\u00b2 = b +6, so a\u00b2 - b =6  \nSimilarly, b\u00b2 -c=6, c\u00b2 -a=6\n\nLet me multiply all three equations:\n\n(a\u00b2 - b)(b\u00b2 -c)(c\u00b2 -a) =6*6*6=216\n\nBut not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that since a, b, c are roots of some cubic equation, and knowing their sum, product, etc.\n\nWait, let me suppose that a, b, c are roots of the cubic equation x\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + Qx - P =0.\n\nFrom Vieta's formula.\n\nWe have S = a + b + c  \nQ = ab + bc + ca  \nP = abc\n\nWe also have:\n\na\u00b2 = b +6  \nb\u00b2 = c +6  \nc\u00b2 = a +6\n\nSo, from the first equation: a\u00b2 - b =6  \nFrom the second: b\u00b2 -c=6  \nFrom the third: c\u00b2 -a=6\n\nLet me arrange these as:\n\na\u00b2 = b +6  \nb\u00b2 = c +6  \nc\u00b2 = a +6\n\nSo, from these, we can express b, c, a in terms of a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2.\n\nBut maybe if I can write a system of equations.\n\nLet me write:\n\nFrom a\u00b2 = b +6 => b = a\u00b2 -6  \nFrom b\u00b2 = c +6 => c = b\u00b2 -6 = (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6  \nFrom c\u00b2 = a +6 => a = c\u00b2 -6 = [ (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 ]^2 -6\n\nWhich is the same as the equation we had earlier: a = f(f(f(a))), leading to a high-degree equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the products.\n\nWait, from a\u00b2 = b +6, multiply all three equations:\n\na\u00b2 * b\u00b2 * c\u00b2 = (b +6)(c +6)(a +6)\n\nWhich we had earlier.\n\nBut since (a +6) = c\u00b2, (b +6)=a\u00b2, (c +6)=b\u00b2, so:\n\na\u00b2 * b\u00b2 * c\u00b2 = c\u00b2 * a\u00b2 * b\u00b2\n\nWhich is an identity, so no new info.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nAnother idea: Let me consider that since a, b, c are distinct, perhaps they can be roots of a cubic equation, and maybe S satisfies a quadratic equation.\n\nLet me try to find an equation involving S.\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\nS = a + b + c  \na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S +18\n\nAlso, (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)\n\nSo,\n\nS\u00b2 = (S +18) + 2Q  \nSo, 2Q = S\u00b2 - S -18  \n=> Q = (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2\n\nSo, Q is expressed in terms of S.\n\nIf I can find another equation involving Q and S, perhaps I can solve for S.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the products.\n\nWait, from the equation a\u00b2 = b +6, so a\u00b2 -6 =b  \nSimilarly, b\u00b2 -6 =c  \nc\u00b2 -6 =a\n\nSo, multiplying these:\n\n(a\u00b2 -6)(b\u00b2 -6)(c\u00b2 -6)=abc\n\nWhich is:\n\n(a\u00b2 -6)(b\u00b2 -6)(c\u00b2 -6) = abc  \n= P\n\nBut from equation 1: a\u00b2 = b +6 => a\u00b2 -6 = b  \nSimilarly, b\u00b2 -6 = c  \nc\u00b2 -6 =a\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nb * c * a = abc  \nSo, (a\u00b2 -6)(b\u00b2 -6)(c\u00b2 -6) = abc  \nBut LHS is (b)(c)(a) = abc = RHS\n\nSo again, it's an identity, which gives us no new information.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider the original equations again.\n\nWait, from a\u00b2 = b +6  \nSubtract a from both sides: a\u00b2 -a = b -a +6  \nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the differences between a, b, c.\n\nLet me define x = a - b  \ny = b - c  \nz = c - a\n\nBut since a, b, c are cyclic, x + y + z =0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express equations in terms of these differences.\n\nWait, let me think.\n\nFrom a\u00b2 = b +6 => a\u00b2 - b =6  \nSimilarly, b\u00b2 -c=6  \nc\u00b2 -a=6\n\nSo, we have:\n\na\u00b2 - b =6  \nb\u00b2 -c=6  \nc\u00b2 -a=6\n\nLet me denote:\n\nEquation 1: a\u00b2 - b =6  \nEquation 2: b\u00b2 -c=6  \nEquation 3: c\u00b2 -a=6\n\nSo, from equation 1: b = a\u00b2 -6  \nFrom equation 2: c = b\u00b2 -6  \nFrom equation 3: a = c\u00b2 -6\n\nSo, substituting each into the next, as before.\n\nI can write a = c\u00b2 -6  \nBut c = b\u00b2 -6, so a = (b\u00b2 -6)^2 -6  \nBut b = a\u00b2 -6, so a = ( (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 )^2 -6\n\nWhich is the same as the equation we had before, leading to the eighth-degree polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this suggests that a satisfies a certain equation, but since it's too high, perhaps we can find a lower-degree equation by considering S.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express S = a + b + c in terms of a.\n\nEarlier, I found that S = a^4 -11a\u00b2 +a +24\n\nBut I also have S = a + b + c  \nWhich can be written as S = a + (a\u00b2 -6) + ( (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 )\n\nLet me compute S - a:\n\nS - a = (a\u00b2 -6) + ( (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 )  \n= a\u00b2 -6 + (a^4 -12a\u00b2 +36) -6  \n= a^4 -11a\u00b2 +24\n\nSo, S = a + (a^4 -11a\u00b2 +24)\n\nBut S is also equal to a + b + c, which is S.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write this as:\n\nS = a + (a^4 -11a\u00b2 +24)  \nBut S is also a function of a, so perhaps this can lead to an equation.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nS - a = a^4 -11a\u00b2 +24  \nBut S = a + b + c, which is a + (a\u00b2 -6) + ( (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 )\n\nWait, we have S = a^4 -11a\u00b2 +a +24\n\nSo, S is expressed in terms of a.\n\nBut perhaps I can write an equation in terms of S.\n\nLet me think.\n\nWait, if I can express a^4 in terms of S.\n\nFrom S = a^4 -11a\u00b2 +a +24,  \nSo, a^4 = S +11a\u00b2 -a -24\n\nNow, from equation 3: c\u00b2 = a +6  \nBut c = (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 = a^4 -12a\u00b2 +30  \nSo, c\u00b2 = (a^4 -12a\u00b2 +30)^2 = a +6\n\nBut from a^4 = S +11a\u00b2 -a -24, substitute into c\u00b2:\n\n(S +11a\u00b2 -a -24 -12a\u00b2 +30)^2 = a +6  \nSimplify inside the square:\n\n(S - a\u00b2 -a +6)^2 = a +6\n\nHmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express a^4 in terms of S and substitute into another equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that S satisfies a quadratic equation.\n\nWait, let me assume that S satisfies a quadratic equation of the form S\u00b2 + pS + q =0\n\nIf I can find such an equation, I can solve for S.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, from earlier:\n\nWe have:\n\nS = a + b + c  \nAnd from the equations, we can express each variable in terms of the next.\n\nBut perhaps if I can find another relation between S and itself.\n\nWait, let me consider:\n\nFrom equation1: a\u00b2 = b +6  \nFrom equation2: b\u00b2 = c +6  \nFrom equation3: c\u00b2 = a +6\n\nLet me write a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c) +18  \nWhich is S +18\n\nAlso, (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)\n\nSo, S\u00b2 = (S +18) + 2Q  \nWhich gives Q = (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2\n\nSo, if I can find Q in terms of S, that's good, but I need another equation involving Q.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute Q\u00b2.\n\nBut I don't have an immediate way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find ab + bc + ca in terms of S.\n\nWait, let me think about the products.\n\nFrom a\u00b2 = b +6, so a\u00b2 -6 = b  \nSimilarly, b =a\u00b2 -6  \nc = b\u00b2 -6  \na = c\u00b2 -6\n\nSo, substituting, a = (b\u00b2 -6)^2 -6  \nBut b =a\u00b2 -6, so:\n\na = ((a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6)^2 -6\n\nWhich is the same as f(f(f(a))) = a, leading to the eighth-degree equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that a, b, c satisfy another relation.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute S^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = 2(ab + bc + ca)\n\nFrom earlier, S^2 - (S +18) = 2Q  \nSo, 2Q = S^2 - S -18  \nWhich we had before.\n\nBut without another equation, I can't solve for S.\n\nWait, another idea: Let me consider that a, b, c satisfy a cubic equation.\n\nLet me assume that a, b, c are roots of x\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + Qx - P =0\n\nFrom Vieta's formula.\n\nBut I need another relation between S, Q, P.\n\nWait, from the equations a\u00b2 = b +6, etc., I can express each variable in terms of the next.\n\nBut perhaps I can write another equation involving the product abc.\n\nWait, let me compute abc.\n\nFrom a\u00b2 = b +6, so a\u00b2 - b =6  \nSimilarly, b\u00b2 -c=6  \nc\u00b2 -a=6\n\nMultiply all three:\n\n(a\u00b2 -b)(b\u00b2 -c)(c\u00b2 -a) =6*6*6=216\n\nBut (a\u00b2 -b) =6, (b\u00b2 -c)=6, (c\u00b2 -a)=6\n\nSo, 6*6*6=216, which doesn't give new info.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that:\n\nFrom a\u00b2 = b +6, so a\u00b2 -6 =b  \nFrom b\u00b2 = c +6, so b\u00b2 -6 =c  \nFrom c\u00b2 =a +6, so c\u00b2 -6 =a\n\nSo, multiplying these:\n\n(a\u00b2 -6)(b\u00b2 -6)(c\u00b2 -6) = abc  \nBut (a\u00b2 -6)(b\u00b2 -6)(c\u00b2 -6) = b c a = abc  \nSo, again, identity.\n\nHmm, stuck again.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the differences between the equations.\n\nFrom a\u00b2 - b =6  \nFrom b\u00b2 -c=6  \nSubtracting these: a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 - (b -c) =0  \nFactor a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 = (a -b)(a +b)  \nSo, (a -b)(a +b) - (b -c)=0  \nWhich is (a -b)(a +b) + (c -b)=0\n\nSimilarly, from b\u00b2 -c=6 and c\u00b2 -a=6  \nSubtract: b\u00b2 -c\u00b2 - (c -a)=0  \nFactor b\u00b2 -c\u00b2= (b -c)(b +c)  \nSo, (b -c)(b +c) + (c -a)=0\n\nAnd from c\u00b2 -a=6 and a\u00b2 -b=6  \nSubtract: c\u00b2 -a\u00b2 - (a -b)=0  \nFactor c\u00b2 -a\u00b2= (c -a)(c +a)  \nSo, (c -a)(c +a) + (b -a)=0\n\nSo, now we have three equations:\n\n1) (a -b)(a +b) + (c -b)=0  \n2) (b -c)(b +c) + (c -a)=0  \n3) (c -a)(c +a) + (b -a)=0\n\nLet me try to manipulate these.\n\nLet me denote equation 1:  \n(a -b)(a +b) + (c -b)=0  \n=> (a -b)(a +b) = b -c  \nSimilarly, equation 2:  \n(b -c)(b +c) = a -c  \nEquation 3:  \n(c -a)(c +a) = a -b\n\nSo, from equation1:  \n(a -b)(a +b) = b -c  \nEquation2:  \n(b -c)(b +c) = a -c  \nEquation3:  \n(c -a)(c +a) = a -b\n\nLet me try to express each ratio.\n\nFrom equation1:  \n(a -b)(a +b) = b -c  \nSo, (a -b)/(b -c) = 1/(a +b)\n\nSimilarly, from equation2:  \n(b -c)(b +c) = a -c  \nSo, (b -c)/(a -c) = 1/(b +c)\n\nFrom equation3:  \n(c -a)(c +a) = a -b  \nSo, (c -a)/(a -b) = 1/(c +a)\n\nHmm, now I have:\n\n(a -b)/(b -c) = 1/(a +b)  \n(b -c)/(a -c) = 1/(b +c)  \n(c -a)/(a -b) = 1/(c +a)\n\nLet me denote these as equation4, equation5, equation6.\n\nFrom equation4:  \n(a -b)/(b -c) = 1/(a +b)  \nCross-multiplying: (a -b)(a +b) = b -c  \nWhich is the same as equation1.\n\nWait, perhaps if I multiply all three equations together.\n\nMultiply equation4, equation5, equation6:\n\n[ (a -b)/(b -c) ] * [ (b -c)/(a -c) ] * [ (c -a)/(a -b) ] = [1/(a +b)] * [1/(b +c)] * [1/(c +a)]\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n(a -b)/(b -c) * (b -c)/(a -c) * (c -a)/(a -b)  \n= [ (a -b)(b -c)(c -a) ] / [ (b -c)(a -c)(a -b) ]\n\nWait, note that (c -a) = -(a -c)\n\nSo, numerator: (a -b)(b -c)(c -a) = (a -b)(b -c)(-1)(a -c)  \nDenominator: (b -c)(a -c)(a -b)\n\nSo, numerator/denominator = [ - (a -b)(b -c)(a -c) ] / [ (b -c)(a -c)(a -b) ) ]  \n= -1\n\nSo, left side is -1.\n\nRight side: 1/( (a +b)(b +c)(c +a) )\n\nSo,\n\n-1 = 1/( (a +b)(b +c)(c +a) )\n\nWhich implies:\n\n(a +b)(b +c)(c +a) = -1\n\nSo, (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = -1\n\nHmm, that's a useful equation.\n\nNow, let me compute (a + b)(b + c)(c + a).\n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\n(a + b) = S - c  \n(b + c) = S -a  \n(c + a) = S -b\n\nSo,\n\n(S - c)(S -a)(S -b) = -1\n\nBut since a, b, c are roots of the cubic equation x\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + Qx - P =0, then (S -a)(S -b)(S -c) = S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 S + S Q - P = S\u00b3 - S\u00b3 + S Q - P = S Q - P\n\nWait, but (S -a)(S -b)(S -c) = S\u00b3 - S\u00b2(a + b + c) + S(ab + bc + ca) - abc  \n= S\u00b3 - S\u00b3 + S Q - P  \n= S Q - P\n\nSo, (S -a)(S -b)(S -c) = S Q - P\n\nBut in our case, (a +b)(b +c)(c +a) = (S -c)(S -a)(S -b) = (S -a)(S -b)(S -c) = S Q - P\n\nSo, S Q - P = -1\n\nSo, S Q - P = -1\n\nSo, we have another equation relating S, Q, P.\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\nS\u00b2 = (S +18) + 2Q  \n=> 2Q = S\u00b2 - S -18  \n=> Q = (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2\n\nAnd we also had S Q - P = -1  \nSo, P = S Q +1\n\nBut from earlier, I had another relation: (a\u00b2 -6)(b\u00b2 -6)(c\u00b2 -6) = abc  \nBut (a\u00b2 -6)=b, (b\u00b2 -6)=c, (c\u00b2 -6)=a  \nSo, (a\u00b2 -6)(b\u00b2 -6)(c\u00b2 -6) = a b c = P  \nThus, P = P  \nAn identity, so no new info.\n\nWait, but we have P = S Q +1\n\nSo, if I can find P in another way, perhaps I can relate it.\n\nWait, from the given equations, we can compute P = abc.\n\nFrom a\u00b2 = b +6  \nSo, b = a\u00b2 -6  \nFrom b\u00b2 = c +6  \nSo, c = b\u00b2 -6 = (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6  \nFrom c\u00b2 = a +6  \nSo, a = c\u00b2 -6 = [ (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 ]^2 -6\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute P = abc in terms of a.\n\nFrom a\u00b2 = b +6, so b = a\u00b2 -6  \nFrom b\u00b2 = c +6, so c = b\u00b2 -6 = (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6  \nSo, abc = a*(a\u00b2 -6)*[(a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6]\n\nSo, P = a*(a\u00b2 -6)*[ (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 ]\n\nBut since P = S Q +1, and Q is known in terms of S, I can write:\n\na*(a\u00b2 -6)*[ (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 ] = S * [ (S\u00b2 -

So, the only factor is (x -3).\n\nTherefore, the minimal polynomial of a is the quotient polynomial, which is seventh degree, but perhaps it can be factored further.\n\nBut factoring a seventh-degree polynomial is challenging, especially without knowing any roots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that S satisfies a quadratic equation.\n\nLet me make an assumption: Suppose that S satisfies S\u00b2 + k S + m =0, where k and m are constants to be determined.\n\nIf I can find such an equation, then solving it would give the two possible values of S.\n\nBut how can I find k and m?\n\nWait, from earlier, I have:\n\nS\u00b2 = (S +18) + 2Q  \n=> 2Q = S\u00b2 - S -18  \nAnd from S Q - P = -1  \nSo, P = S Q +1\n\nBut I also have P = abc, which can be written in terms of S.\n\nWait, since S is expressed in terms of a: S = a^4 -11a\u00b2 +a +24\n\nAnd P = abc = a*(a\u00b2 -6)*(a^4 -12a\u00b2 +30)\n\nBut I don't see a direct way to relate this to S.\n\nWait, another idea: Perhaps I can eliminate a from the equations.\n\nFrom S = a + b + c  \nBut b = a\u00b2 -6  \nc = (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6  \nSo, S = a + a\u00b2 -6 + (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6  \n= a + a\u00b2 -6 + a^4 -12a\u00b2 +36 -6  \n= a^4 -11a\u00b2 +a +24\n\nSo, S = a^4 -11a\u00b2 +a +24  \nLet me denote this as equation A.\n\nFrom equation3: c\u00b2 = a +6  \nBut c = (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6  \nSo, c\u00b2 = [ (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 ]^2 = a +6  \nWhich is equation B.\n\nSo, equation B is [ (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 ]^2 = a +6  \nWhich is the same as f\u00b3(a) = a, as before.\n\nBut equation A: S = a^4 -11a\u00b2 +a +24\n\nSo, perhaps I can write equation B in terms of S.\n\nFrom equation A, express a^4 in terms of S:\n\na^4 = S +11a\u00b2 -a -24\n\nSubstitute into equation B:\n\n[ (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 ]^2 = a +6  \nLet me compute (a\u00b2 -6)^2:\n\n= a^4 -12a\u00b2 +36  \nFrom a^4 = S +11a\u00b2 -a -24  \nSo, a^4 -12a\u00b2 +36 = (S +11a\u00b2 -a -24) -12a\u00b2 +36  \n= S -a\u00b2 -a +12\n\nSo, (a\u00b2 -6)^2 = S -a\u00b2 -a +12  \nThus, (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 = S -a\u00b2 -a +12 -6 = S -a\u00b2 -a +6\n\nSo, equation B becomes:\n\n(S -a\u00b2 -a +6)^2 = a +6\n\nBut from equation A: S = a^4 -11a\u00b2 +a +24  \nSo, S -a\u00b2 -a +6 = a^4 -11a\u00b2 +a +24 -a\u00b2 -a +6  \n= a^4 -12a\u00b2 +30\n\nSo, equation B becomes:\n\n(a^4 -12a\u00b2 +30)^2 = a +6\n\nWhich is again the same as equation B.\n\nBut we can write:\n\n(S -a\u00b2 -a +6)^2 = a +6\n\nBut S = a^4 -11a\u00b2 +a +24, so S - a\u00b2 -a +6 = a^4 -12a\u00b2 +30\n\nSo, it's the same.\n\nI think this approach isn't leading me anywhere.\n\nWait, another idea: Let me consider that the eighth-degree equation can be factored as (x -3)(x +3)(something).

k, for some k to eliminate the quadratic term.\n\nBut it's getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that S satisfies the cubic equation, so it has three roots, but since a, b, c are distinct, maybe only two of them are valid.\n\nBut without solving the cubic, I can't find S.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the minimal polynomial of S is quadratic, but I can't see how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that S satisfies S\u00b2 = something in terms of S.\n\nWait, perhaps S\u00b2 = S +18 +2Q  \nBut Q = (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nS\u00b2 = S +18 +2*( (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2 )  \nSimplify:\n\nS\u00b2 = S +18 + (S\u00b2 - S -18)  \n= S +18 + S\u00b2 -S -18  \n= S\u00b2\n\nSo, S\u00b2 = S\u00b2 \u2192 0=0\n\nWhich is an identity, so no new info.\n\nHmm, this is really tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the cubic equation in S has roots which are the possible values of S.\n\nSo, the two possible values of S are the two real roots of the cubic equation.\n\nBut since the cubic is 2S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -11S +24=0, and it's difficult to factor, perhaps I can use numerical methods or the rational root theorem again.\n\nWait, perhaps I can try S= 3 again.\n\nWait, S=3:\n\n2*27 -9 -33 +24=54 -9 -33 +24=36\u22600\n\nS= 4:\n\n2*64 -16 -44 +24=128 -16 -44 +24=92\u22600\n\nS= 2:\n\n2*8 -4 -22 +24=16-4-22+24=14\u22600\n\nS= 1.5:\n\n2*(3.375) -2.25 -16.5 +24=6.75 -2.25 -16.5 +24=11.25\u22600\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps S=  -2:\n\n2*(-8) -4 +22 +24= -16 -4 +22 +24=26\u22600\n\nWait, perhaps S= 1:\n\n2 -1 -11 +24=14\u22600\n\nWait, S=  -1:\n\n-2 -1 +11 +24=32\u22600\n\nHmm, none of the simple rational numbers are roots.\n\nSo, perhaps the cubic is irreducible over rationals, meaning the roots are irrational or complex.\n\nBut the problem states that a, b, c are complex numbers, so S can be a complex number.\n\nBut the problem asks for the two possible values of S, implying that there are two possible real or complex values.\n\nWait, maybe the cubic equation has three roots, but due to the symmetric nature, perhaps two of them are valid.\n\nBut without knowing the roots, I can't proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that S satisfies a quadratic equation derived from the cubic.\n\nBut I don't see a way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can assume that S satisfies S\u00b2 = something.\n\nWait, from earlier:\n\nS\u00b2 = (S +18) + 2Q  \nAnd Q = (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nS\u00b2 = S +18 + (S\u00b2 - S -18)  \n= S +18 + S\u00b2 -S -18  \n= S\u00b2\n\nWhich again is an identity.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write the cubic equation as:\n\n2S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -11S +24=0  \nLet me write it as:\n\n2S\u00b3 = S\u00b2 +11S -24  \nSo, 2S\u00b3 = S\u00b2 +11S -24  \nDivide both sides by S (assuming S\u22600):\n\n2S\u00b2 = S +11 -24/S  \nBut not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write S in terms of S\u00b2.\n\nBut I don't see a way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the cubic equation as:\n\n2S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -11S +24=0  \nLet me try to factor it as (S - a)(2S\u00b2 + bS +c)=0\n\nExpanding:\n\nS*(2S\u00b2 +bS +c) -a*(2S\u00b2 +bS +c)  \n=2S\u00b3 +bS\u00b2 +cS -2aS\u00b2 -abS -ac  \n=2S\u00b3 + (b -2a)S\u00b2 + (c -ab)S -ac\n\nSet equal to original:\n\n2S\u00b3 -S\u00b2 -11S +24=0\n\nSo,\n\nCoefficients:\n\nb -2a = -1  \nc -ab = -11  \n-ac=24\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1) b = 2a -1  \n2) c = ab -11  \n3) a c = -24\n\nFrom equation 3: c = -24/a\n\nFrom equation 2: c = a b -11  \nBut from equation1: b=2a -1  \nSo, c= a*(2a -1) -11=2a\u00b2 -a -11\n\nBut from equation3: c= -24/a  \nSo,\n\n2a\u00b2 -a -11 = -24/a  \nMultiply both sides by a:\n\n2a\u00b3 -a\u00b2 -11a = -24  \n=> 2a\u00b3 -a\u00b2 -11a +24=0\n\nWhich is the same as our cubic equation. So, this approach doesn't help.\n\nThus, I think the cubic is irreducible, and I can't factor it further with rational roots.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I need to accept that S satisfies the cubic equation 2S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -11S +24=0 and find its roots numerically or by using the cubic formula.\n\nBut since the problem asks for the two possible values, perhaps there are two real roots and one complex, but since a, b, c are complex, maybe S can take two values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cubic can be factored as (S -3)(quadratic), but when we tried earlier, it didn't work.\n\nWait, let me try polynomial division again.\n\nDivide 2S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -11S +24 by (S -3):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 2 | -1 | -11 |24\n\nBring down 2.\n\nMultiply 2 by3=6, add to -1:5\n\nMultiply5 by3=15, add to -11:4\n\nMultiply4 by3=12, add to24:36\u22600\n\nSo, remainder is36\u22600, so S=3 is not a root.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I divided the eighth-degree equation by (x-3), the remainder was zero, but in the cubic equation, S=3 is not a root. That's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, the cubic equation was derived from the eighth-degree equation, so if S=3 is a root of the eighth-degree, it must satisfy the cubic, but it doesn't.\n\nSo, something is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in deriving the cubic equation.\n\nLet me go back.\n\nWe had:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 - S(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) + Q S -3P=0  \nThen, a\u00b3 +b\u00b3 +c\u00b3 = Q +6S  \na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = S +18  \nSo,\n\n(Q +6S) - S(S +18) + Q S -3P=0  \n= Q +6S -S\u00b2 -18S + Q S -3P=0  \n= -S\u00b2 + Q + Q S -12S -3P=0\n\nFrom S Q - P = -1 => P= S Q +1  \nSubstitute:\n\n- S\u00b2 + Q + Q S -12S -3(S Q +1)=0  \n= - S\u00b2 + Q + Q S -12S -3 S Q -3=0  \n= - S\u00b2 + Q(1 + S -3 S) -12S -3=0  \n= - S\u00b2 + Q(1 -2 S) -12S -3=0\n\nFrom earlier, Q = (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2\n\nSubstitute:\n\n- S\u00b2 + [ (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2 ](1 -2 S) -12S -3=0\n\nMultiply numerator:\n\n(S\u00b2 - S -18)(1 -2 S)  \n= S\u00b2 -2 S\u00b3 - S +2 S\u00b2 -18 +36 S  \n= -2 S\u00b3 +3 S\u00b2 +35 S -18\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(-2 S\u00b3 +3 S\u00b2 +35 S -18)/2 -12 S -3=0  \nMultiply all terms by 2:\n\n-2 S\u00b3 +3 S\u00b2 +35 S -18 -24 S -6=0  \nCombine like terms:\n\n-2 S\u00b3 +3 S\u00b2 +11 S -24=0  \nMultiply by -1:\n\n2 S\u00b3 -3 S\u00b2 -11 S +24=0\n\nWait, earlier I had 2S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -11S +24=0.

S -18=0, but earlier that led to S\u00b2= S +18 +2Q, which isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the two possible values of S are the roots of S\u00b2 - S -18=0, which are [1 \u00b1 sqrt(73)]/2, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nIf S\u00b2 = S +18 +2Q  \nAnd Q=(S\u00b2 -

but I can't find it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two possible values are 3 and 4, but they don't satisfy.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that S=3 is a root, but it's not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps
