      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the smallest positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written using only the digits 0 and 2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. I need a multiple of 30, which means it has to be divisible by 30. The number can only consist of the digits 0 and 2. So, numbers like 2, 20, 22, 200, 202, etc., but I need to find the smallest one that's a multiple of 30.\n\nI remember that 30 is 2 * 3 * 5, so any multiple of 30 must be divisible by 2, 3, and 5. So, let's break down the conditions:\n\n1. Divisible by 2: The number must be even, so its last digit has to be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. But since we can only use 0 and 2, the last digit must be 0 or 2. However, for it to be divisible by 2, it's sufficient for the last digit to be even, which it is in both cases. But let's remember that.\n\n2. Divisible by 5: The number must end with 0 or 5. But again, we can only use 0 and 2, so the last digit must be 0. So, combining this with the previous condition, the number must end with 0.\n\n3. Divisible by 3: The sum of the digits must be a multiple of 3. Since the digits can only be 0 and 2, the sum of the digits will be 2 * (number of 2s). So, 2 * (number of 2s) must be divisible by 3. That means the number of 2s must be a multiple of 3 because 2 and 3 are coprime. So, the number must have a number of 2s that is a multiple of 3.\n\nPutting this all together, the number must end with 0, and the number of 2s in the number must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo, the number will look like a series of 2s followed by a 0. But wait, it could also have 0s in between, but since the smallest such number is desired, it's probably more efficient to have all the 2s first and then the 0. Because any 0s in between would make the number longer without necessarily making it smaller. Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, if we have 0s in between, it might create a smaller number. For example, 2020 is smaller than 2220, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, 2020 is 2020, while 2220 is 2220. 2020 is smaller than 2220. So, perhaps having 0s in between can lead to a smaller number. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nBut maybe the smallest number is the one with the fewest digits, so let's try to find the smallest number of digits possible.\n\nWait, but the number must end with 0, so the last digit is fixed. The rest of the digits can be 0 or 2, but the sum of all digits must be a multiple of 3, and the number must be as small as possible.\n\nSo, let's think about the number of digits.\n\nLet me denote the number as N. Since it must end with 0, the last digit is 0. The other digits can be 2 or 0, but the sum of the digits (excluding the last 0) must be a multiple of 3.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all digits, including the last 0, must be a multiple of 3. Since the last digit is 0, it doesn't contribute to the sum. So, the sum of the remaining digits must be a multiple of 3.\n\nEach digit is either 0 or 2, so the sum will be 2 times the number of 2s. So, 2 * (number of 2s) must be divisible by 3. So, number of 2s must be a multiple of 3, as 2 and 3 are coprime.\n\nSo, the number of 2s should be 3, 6, 9, etc. Since we're looking for the smallest number, we want the smallest number of digits possible, so the minimal number of 2s is 3.\n\nSo, we need at least 3 digits, but wait, the number must end with 0, so the minimal length would be 4 digits: three 2s and a 0 at the end. But wait, that's 2220, which is 2220. But is there a smaller number with fewer digits?\n\nWait, let's see. The number must end with 0, so the minimal number of digits is 2: for example, 20. But 20 is 20, which is 20. Is 20 a multiple of 30? No, because 20 is not divisible by 3. So, 20 is not a multiple of 30.\n\nSimilarly, let's check 20: sum of digits is 2, which is not divisible by 3. So, 20 is not a multiple of 3. So, 20 isn't a multiple of 30.\n\nNext, let's check 220. Wait, 220 is 220. Let's see if it's a multiple of 30.\n\nFirst, does it end with 0? Yes. So, it's divisible by 10, which is good. Then, check divisibility by 3: sum of digits is 2 + 2 + 0 = 4, which is not divisible by 3. So, 220 is not a multiple of 30.\n\nSo, next, let's try 2220. Sum of digits is 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 6, which is divisible by 3. So, 2220 is divisible by 3. Since it ends with 0, it's divisible by 10. So, it's divisible by both 3 and 10, meaning it's divisible by 30. So, 2220 is a multiple of 30.\n\nBut wait, is there a smaller number than 2220 that satisfies the conditions? Let's think.\n\nIf I try to find a number with fewer digits. For example, let's try 3-digit numbers. The possible numbers would be 200, 202, 220.\n\n- 200: sum is 2, not divisible by 3.\n- 202: sum is 4, not divisible by 3.\n- 220: sum is 4, not divisible by 3.\n\nSo, none of the 3-digit numbers work.\n\nNext, 4-digit numbers: The smallest 4-digit number ending with 0, using only 0s and 2s, is 2000. But sum is 2, which isn't divisible by 3.\n\nNext, 2002: sum is 4, not divisible by 3.\n\n2020: sum is 4, again not.\n\n2022: sum is 6, which is divisible by 3. So, 2022 is a multiple of 3. Let's check if it's divisible by 5: it ends with 2, so no, it's not. So, it's not a multiple of 30.\n\nWait, but we need the number to end with 0 to be divisible by 5 and 2. So, 2022 ends with 2, so it's not divisible by 5. So, it's not a multiple of 30.\n\nSo, moving on. Next 4-digit number ending with 0: 2200. Sum is 4, not divisible by 3.\n\n2202: ends with 2, not divisible by 5.\n\n2220: sum is 6, which is divisible by 3. It ends with 0, so it's divisible by 10. So, 2220 is a multiple of 30.\n\nBut wait, 2020 didn't work because it ends with 0, but sum is 4, which isn't divisible by 3. So, 2220 is the next candidate.\n\nBut let me see if there's a smaller number with more digits but a smaller value. Wait, 2220 is 2220, which is 2220. Is there a number like 2000000002220 that is smaller? No, because 2220 is just 2220, which is less than any number with more digits.\n\nWait, but wait, is 2220 the smallest possible? Let me think again.\n\nWait, let's try numbers with 4 digits. We saw that 2020 is 2020, which is smaller than 2220. But 2020 isn't divisible by 3 because the sum is 4, as we saw.\n\nWhat about a 5-digit number? Maybe something like 20000. Sum is 2, not divisible by 3. 20002: sum is 4. 20020: sum is 4. 20022: sum is 6. So, 20022 is a 5-digit number, ends with 2, so not divisible by 5. So, not a multiple of 30.\n\nSimilarly, 20200: sum is 4, not divisible by 3.\n\n20202: sum is 6, but ends with 2, so not divisible by 5.\n\n20220: sum is 6, ends with 0. So, 20220 is a multiple of 30. Let me check 20220.\n\nYes, 20220 ends with 0, so divisible by 10. Sum of digits is 2+0+2+2+0=6, which is divisible by 3. So, 20220 is a multiple of 30. But 20220 is larger than 2220, right?\n\nWait, no: 20220 is 20220, which is less than 22200, but 2220 is 2220, which is smaller than 20220. Wait, no: 20220 is 20 thousand something, while 2220 is 2 thousand something. So, 2220 is smaller than 20220.\n\nWait, but 2220 is 2220, which is 2220. Let me confirm: 2220 is 2220, which is less than 20220, which is 20,220. So, 2220 is smaller.\n\nSo, 2220 is a 4-digit number, 20220 is a 5-digit number. So, 2220 is smaller.\n\nWait, but let's think if there's a 4-digit number smaller than 2220 that satisfies the conditions.\n\nWe saw that 2000 is 2000, sum is 2, not divisible by 3.\n\n2002: sum is 4, not divisible by 3.\n\n2020: sum is 4, not divisible by 3.\n\n2022: sum is 6, but ends with 2, so not divisible by 5.\n\n2200: sum is 4, not divisible by 3.\n\n2202: ends with 2, not divisible by 5.\n\n2220: sum is 6, ends with 0. So, 2220 is the first 4-digit number that meets all the conditions.\n\nBut wait, is there a 3-digit number? As we saw earlier, no. So, 2220 is the smallest. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe a number with more digits but smaller in value. For example, 200000002220 is longer, but it's a larger number, so 2220 is still smaller.\n\nWait, but let me think of another approach. Maybe instead of trying numbers sequentially, I can model this as a problem of finding the minimal number composed of 2s and 0s, ending with 0, and sum of digits divisible by 3.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the smallest number (in value) composed of 0s and 2s, ending with 0, and the sum of digits is a multiple of 3.\n\nTo minimize the number, we want the smallest number of digits possible, and with the smallest digits on the left.\n\nSo, let's think in terms of the number of digits.\n\nWe know that the number must end with 0, so the last digit is fixed as 0. The rest of the digits can be 0 or 2, but the sum (excluding the last 0) must be a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, no: the total sum of all digits must be a multiple of 3. Since the last digit is 0, the sum of the other digits must be a multiple of 3 because 0 doesn't contribute anything.\n\nSo, the sum of the digits before the last 0 must be a multiple of 3. Each digit is either 0 or 2, so the sum is 2 * (number of 2s). Therefore, 2 * k must be divisible by 3, where k is the number of 2s. So, k must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo, the minimal k is 3. Thus, the number must have at least 3 digits before the last 0, all of which are 2s. So, the number would be 2220.\n\nBut wait, is that necessarily the case? Because maybe we can have a number with more digits where the sum is still a multiple of 3, but the number itself is smaller. For example, 2020 is smaller than 2220, but as we saw, its sum is 4, which isn't a multiple of 3.\n\nAlternatively, could we have a number like 20020? Sum is 4, not a multiple of 3. 20200: sum is 4. 200020: sum is 4. 200220: sum is 6. So, 200220 is a candidate. Let's see: 200220. It ends with 0, sum is 6, which is divisible by 3. So, it's a multiple of 30. But 200220 is 200,220, which is much larger than 2220.\n\nSo, 2220 is smaller than 200220.\n\nBut wait, is there a number between 2020 and 2220 that meets the conditions? Let's see.\n\nWait, 2020 is 2020, which is smaller than 2220. But its sum is 4, not divisible by 3. So, it's not a multiple of 30.\n\nWhat about 20020? No, sum is 4. 20200: sum is 4. 200020: sum is 4. 200220: sum is 6, but it's larger than 2220.\n\nSo, 2220 is indeed the smallest.\n\nBut let me think again: is 2220 the smallest multiple of 30 using only 0s and 2s?\n\nWait, another approach: since the number must end with 0, let's think about numbers like 20, 200, 2000, etc., but we saw that 20 isn't a multiple of 30 because it's not divisible by 3. Similarly, 200: sum is 2, not divisible by 3. 2000: sum is 2. 20000: sum is 2. So, none of these are divisible by 3.\n\nSo, the next possible is to have the sum of digits as 6, which is the next multiple of 3 after 3 (but 3 isn't possible because we can't have a number ending with 0 with sum 3, as that would require 1.5 2s, which isn't possible). So, the next is 6.\n\nSo, to get a sum of 6, we need three 2s. So, the number must have three 2s and end with 0. The minimal number would be arranging the 2s as far to the right as possible to make the number as small as possible.\n\nWait, but to make the number as small as possible, we want the smallest possible number of digits, and within that, the smallest numerical value. So, for 4 digits, the smallest number with three 2s and ending with 0 is 2020, but wait, no: 2020 has two 2s and two 0s. Wait, no: 2020 is 2,0,2,0. So, sum is 4, not 6.\n\nAh, right, so to get sum 6, we need three 2s. So, in 4 digits, the number would be 2220, which is 2,2,2,0. That's the only 4-digit number with three 2s and ending with 0.\n\nAlternatively, could we have a number with more digits but a smaller value? For example, 20020: 2,0,0,2,0. Sum is 4, not 6. 20200: same. 200020: same. So, to get sum 6, the minimal number is 2220.\n\nWait, but is there a way to arrange the digits to have a smaller number than 2220 with sum 6? Let's see.\n\nFor example, 200220: sum is 6, but it's a 6-digit number, which is larger than 2220.\n\nAlternatively, 20220: which is 2,0,2,2,0: sum is 6. So, 20220 is a 5-digit number. But 20220 is 20220, which is larger than 2220 (which is 2220). So, 2220 is smaller.\n\nSo, 2220 is the smallest.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if 2220 is indeed a multiple of 30.\n\n30 times 74 is 2220. Because 30*70=2100, 30*4=120, so 2100+120=2220. Yes, so 2220 is 30*74, which is correct.\n\nSo, 2220 is a multiple of 30, uses only digits 0 and 2, and is the smallest such number.\n\nBut wait, I just thought of something.
