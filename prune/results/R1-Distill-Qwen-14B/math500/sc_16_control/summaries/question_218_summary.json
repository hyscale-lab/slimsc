      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem: find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and ones. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that 450 is the number we're dealing with. To find a multiple of 450, that means the number we're looking for must be divisible by 450. Let me factor 450 to understand its prime components. So, 450 can be broken down into prime factors as 450 = 2 \u00d7 3\u00b2 \u00d7 5\u00b2. That means any multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25.\n\nAlright, so our number needs to be made up of only 0s and 1s, and it must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. Let me break down the divisibility rules for each of these:\n\n1. Divisible by 2: The number must end with an even digit, which in this case can only be 0 because we're only using 0s and 1s. So the last digit has to be 0.\n\n2. Divisible by 25: The last two digits must form a number that's divisible by 25. Since the last digit is 0, the second last digit can only be 0 or 5. But since we can only use 0s and 1s, the second last digit must be 0. So, the last two digits are 00.\n\n3. Divisible by 9: The sum of all the digits must be a multiple of 9. Since our digits are only 0s and 1s, the number of 1s in the number must be a multiple of 9.\n\nSo, putting these together, the number must have a bunch of 1s followed by two 0s at the end. Let me represent it as a number with 'n' number of 1s followed by two 0s. So the number would look like 111...1100, where there are 'n' 1s.\n\nNow, the next thing is to find the smallest such number. Since we want the smallest number, we need the fewest number of digits possible. That would come from the smallest 'n' such that the digit sum (which is 'n') is a multiple of 9. The smallest such 'n' is 9, right? Because 9 is the smallest multiple of 9. So, we can start by checking if a number with nine 1s followed by two 0s is divisible by 450.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smaller number? Let me think again. If we have fewer than nine 1s, say 9 is the minimal because 9 is the next multiple after that. But let's test this.\n\nSo, the number would be 11111111100. Let me check if this number is divisible by 450. Since 450 is 45 \u00d7 10, and 45 is 9 \u00d7 5. So, the number must end with 00, which it does, so it's divisible by 100, which is more than enough for 10 and 25. The sum of digits is 9, which is divisible by 9, so that's good. So, 11111111100 is a multiple of 450.\n\nBut is this the smallest possible? Let me see if there's a smaller number with fewer digits. Maybe the number doesn't have to have all the 1s at the beginning. Maybe a different arrangement of 1s and 0s could result in a smaller number. For example, maybe a number with fewer digits but arranged with 1s not all at the front.\n\nWait, but the number has to end with 00, so the last two digits are fixed. So, the rest of the digits can be 1s and 0s, but the digits before that can have some 0s, which might make the number smaller. Hmm, but since we want the smallest number, it's better to have the smaller number of digits, but also, the leftmost digits should be as small as possible.\n\nWait, but having more 1s at the front would actually make the number larger. So, to get the smallest number, we should have the fewest number of digits possible. So, the number of digits is 'n + 2', where 'n' is the number of 1s. So, to minimize the number, we need the smallest 'n' such that the sum of digits is a multiple of 9, which is 9. So, the number would have 9 ones and two zeros, making it 11 digits long.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a number with fewer digits. Let me think. What if the number has some 0s among the 1s? For example, maybe a number like 10101010100. Does that have a digit sum of 9? Let's count the 1s: 1,3,5,7,9 positions have 1s. That's five 1s. But 5 isn't a multiple of 9, so the digit sum isn't divisible by 9. So that number wouldn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 1011001100. Wait, that's 1s in the 1,3,4,6,8,9 positions. So, six 1s. 6 isn't a multiple of 9, so that wouldn't work either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a number with nine 1s but placed in such a way that the number is smaller. For example, placing some 0s in the higher places. Wait, but the number must have 9 1s, so the minimal number of digits is 9 + 2 = 11. So regardless of where the 1s are placed, the number will have 11 digits. But to make the number as small as possible, we want the leftmost digits to be 0s as much as possible. But wait, the first digit can't be 0 because then it wouldn't be an 11-digit number. So, the first digit has to be 1.\n\nSo, the smallest possible number with nine 1s and two 0s at the end is going to start with 1, followed by as many 0s as possible, but we need nine 1s. Wait, no, actually, in the number, you can intersperse 0s among the 1s to make the number smaller. For example, 100000000000 has 1 followed by twelve 0s, but that's only one 1. But we need nine 1s. Hmm, perhaps the way to make the smallest number is to have the 1s as far to the right as possible, while still having nine of them. But wait, the number must end with two 0s, so the last two digits are fixed as 00. So, the nine 1s have to be in the first nine positions, but we can have 0s among them.\n\nWait, perhaps arranging the 1s as far to the right as possible within the first nine digits. So, for example, 1000000000000, but that's only one 1. Wait, but we need nine 1s. So, maybe 1000000000000000000000000000000000, but that's not correct because we have to have nine 1s.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to minimize the number by placing the 1s as far to the right as possible, but within the first nine digits. So, the number would have a 1 in the units place, but no, units place is 0. Wait, no, the last two digits are 0, so the ninth digit from the right is the first digit before the two zeros. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number is indeed 11111111100, which is 11 digits long, starting with nine 1s followed by two 0s. But is that the smallest number? Let me check if a smaller number exists with the same digit sum but arranged differently.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the number doesn't have to have all the 1s in the front. Maybe having a 1 followed by some 0s and then more 1s could result in a smaller number. For example, 100000000000 has 1 followed by twelve 0s, but that's only one 1. If I have 100100100100, that's using 1s separated by 0s, but let's count the 1s: 1,3,5,7,9,11. That's six 1s, which isn't enough. To get nine 1s, we need to have them spread out, but that would require more digits, making the number longer, which isn't smaller. So, actually, having all 1s at the front followed by two 0s might actually be the smallest number in terms of value, not just digit count.\n\nWait, but maybe not. For example, 100000000000 (1 followed by twelve 0s) is 10^12, which is 1000000000000. But if we have 11111111100, that's 11111111100, which is 11,111,111,100. Comparing these two, 11,111,111,100 is about 1.111... \u00d710^10, whereas 10^12 is 1,000,000,000,000, which is much larger. So, 11111111100 is smaller than 10^12, even though it has fewer digits (11 digits vs 13 digits). So, perhaps 11111111100 is indeed the smallest.\n\nBut wait, let me check another possibility. Maybe a number with 18 1s, which is a multiple of 9, but arranged in a way that it's smaller. But that would make the number longer, so it's not going to be smaller than 11111111100.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number with 9 1s can be arranged with 0s in between, making it a smaller number numerically. For example, 100000000000 (1 followed by twelve 0s) is 10^12, which is 1,000,000,000,000. But 11111111100 is 11,111,111,100, which is way smaller than 10^12. So, 11111111100 is indeed smaller.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a number with 9 1s but placed in such a way that the number is smaller. For example,
