      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here: What is the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and ones? Hmm, let's break this down and try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that 450 is the number we're dealing with. I remember that to find a multiple of 450, the number has to be divisible by 450. And since 450 factors into prime numbers as 2 \u00d7 3\u00b2 \u00d7 5\u00b2, that means any multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. So, the number we're looking for has to satisfy these three conditions:\n\n1. It must be divisible by 2.\n2. It must be divisible by 9.\n3. It must be divisible by 25.\n\nAlright, let me tackle each of these one by one, and see how they affect the number we're looking for.\n\nStarting with the first condition: divisible by 2. That means the number has to be even. So, the last digit must be 0. Since we can only use zeros and ones, the number must end with a 0. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, the third condition: divisible by 25. Now, I know that a number is divisible by 25 if its last two digits are 00, 25, 50, or 75. But since our number can only have 0s and 1s, the only possible ending is 00. So, the number must end with two zeros. That gives us more information: the last two digits are 00. So, the number looks something like ...00.\n\nNow, moving on to the second condition: divisible by 9. A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. Since our number can only consist of 1s and 0s, the sum of the digits will just be the number of 1s in it. So, the number of 1s must be a multiple of 9.\n\nPutting this together: we need a number made up of 1s and 0s, ending with two 0s, and the number of 1s must be 9, 18, 27, etc. We need the smallest such number, so we should aim for the smallest number of digits possible, which would mean the smallest number of 1s. So, the minimum number of 1s is 9.\n\nWait, but hold on. If the number has to end with two 0s, then the number of digits must be at least three: for example, 100. But 100 isn't a multiple of 450 because 100 is 450 divided by 4.5, which isn't an integer. So, we need a longer number.\n\nSo, let me think. The number has to be made up of some 1s followed by two 0s. So, the structure would be something like 1...100, where the middle part can have 1s and 0s, but ends with two 0s.\n\nWait, but actually, no. The number can have 1s and 0s in any positions, but the last two digits must be 0s because of the divisibility by 25. So, the number could have 1s anywhere, but ends with 00.\n\nBut since we want the smallest number, we should try to have as few digits as possible. So, the number should be as short as it can be while meeting all the conditions.\n\nSo, the number must have at least three digits: two 0s and at least one 1. But we also need the sum of digits to be a multiple of 9. So, the number of 1s must be 9, 18, etc. So, the smallest number of digits would be 11 digits: nine 1s and two 0s. But wait, the 0s have to be at the end. So, it would be something like 11111111100. That's 11 digits.\n\nBut is 11111111100 divisible by 450? Let's check.\n\nFirst, is it divisible by 2? Yes, because it ends with 0.\n\nSecond, is it divisible by 25? Yes, because it ends with 00.\n\nThird, is it divisible by 9? The sum of the digits is 9, which is divisible by 9. So, yes.\n\nSo, 11111111100 is a multiple of 450.\n\nBut wait, is this the smallest possible number? Let me think. Could there be a smaller number, with fewer digits, that still satisfies all the conditions?\n\nWait, 11111111100 is 11 digits. What about a number with fewer digits? Let's see.\n\nSuppose we have a number with 9 digits: 111111111. But wait, that's 111,111,111. Is that divisible by 25? No, because it doesn't end with 00, 25, 50, or 75. So, that's out.\n\nWhat about 10 digits? Let's see.\n\nA 10-digit number ending with 00. So, the first 8 digits can be 1s and 0s, but the last two digits are 0. The sum of digits must be a multiple of 9. So, the number of 1s in the first 8 digits must be a multiple of 9. But 8 is less than 9, so the number of 1s can't be 9. So, the next possible is 18, but that would require more than 10 digits. So, 10 digits won't work.\n\nWhat about 9 digits? As above, 9 digits can't end with 00, so that's not possible.\n\nSo, the next possible is 11 digits. So, 11 digits is the minimum.\n\nBut wait, is 11111111100 the smallest in terms of value? Let me check.\n\nWait, maybe arranging the 1s and 0s differently could give a smaller number. For example, putting the 1s at the beginning and the 0s at the end, as we did, but perhaps inserting some 0s earlier on might result in a smaller number.\n\nWait, but numbers are compared digit by digit from left to right. So, to get the smallest number, we should have as few digits as possible, and within that, the leftmost digits should be as small as possible.\n\nWait, but since we need 9 ones, we can't avoid having 9 ones. So, the number must have exactly 9 ones and 2 zeros at the end.\n\nBut wait, that's 11 digits total. So, the smallest such number is the one with the 1s as far to the right as possible. Wait, no, actually, the smallest number would be the one where the 1s are as far to the left as possible because that makes the number smaller.\n\nWait, no, actually, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, numbers are compared digit by digit, starting from the left. So, to get the smallest number, you want the leftmost digit to be as small as possible. Since the first digit must be 1 (because it's the smallest positive multiple, so it can't be 0), then the next digits should be as small as possible, but we have to include all the 1s.\n\nWait, but the number must have nine 1s and two 0s at the end. So, perhaps arranging the 1s and 0s such that the number is as small as possible.\n\nWait, but actually, the number is determined by the positions of the 1s. So, to make the number as small as possible, we should have the 1s as far to the right as possible, and the 0s as far to the left as possible after the first digit.\n\nWait, that might not be correct.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose we have two numbers: 10000000000 and 10000000001. The first one is smaller because after the first 1, the rest are 0s. But in our case, we have to have exactly nine 1s and two 0s at the end.\n\nWait, but no. Wait, actually, the number must have exactly nine 1s, spread out in the digits, but all ending with two 0s. So, how can we arrange the 1s to make the number as small as possible?\n\nTo minimize the number, we should place the 1s as far to the right as possible, while keeping the number ending with two 0s. Because that way, the higher place digits are 0, which makes the number smaller.\n\nWait, but the first digit must be 1, because otherwise, it would start with 0, which isn't allowed for a positive number. So, the first digit is 1, and then we can place the remaining eight 1s as far to the right as possible.\n\nSo, the number would be 1 followed by eight 0s and then two 0s? Wait, no. Wait, we have nine 1s in total. So, first digit is 1, then we have eight more 1s, and the last two digits are 0s.\n\nWait, but that would require 1 (first digit) + 8 ones in the middle + 2 zeros at the end, totaling 11 digits. So, the number would be 1 followed by eight 0s and two 0s? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, it's 1 followed by a bunch of 1s and 0s, ending with two 0s.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number is 11111111100, which is 1 followed by eight 1s and ending with two 0s. But that's 11 digits. Alternatively, maybe arranging the 1s more towards the end could give a smaller number.\n\nWait, for example, 100000000000 would be 1 followed by twelve 0s, which is 10^12, but that has only one 1, which isn't enough for divisibility by 9. So, that won't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 100111111100, but that's 12 digits, which is longer. So, 11 digits seems to be the minimum.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a number with fewer digits that still meets all the conditions. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 450 is 2 \u00d7 225, and 225 is 15\u00b2. But I don't know if that helps.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the number is a multiple of 450, so it's also a multiple of 100 because it's divisible by 25 and 2. Wait, no, 450 is 2 \u00d7 3\u00b2 \u00d7 5\u00b2, so the number must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. So, it must be divisible by LCM(2,9,25) = 450. So, the number has to be a multiple of 450.\n\nSo, the number is N = 450 \u00d7 k, where k is a positive integer.\n\nWe need N to consist only of 0s and 1s.\n\nSo, perhaps, instead of trying to construct the number, we can look for the smallest k such that 450 \u00d7 k is a number with only 0s and 1s.\n\nSo, let's think of it that way. Let's compute 450 \u00d7 k for k=1,2,3,... and check if the product consists only of 0s and 1s.\n\nBut that might take a lot of time. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, since the number must end with two 0s, as established earlier, the number is N = 100 \u00d7 m, where m is a number consisting of 1s and 0s, since N must consist of 1s and 0s. But wait, if N = 100 \u00d7 m, then m must be such that 100 \u00d7 m has only 1s and 0s.\n\nWait, no. Because 100 \u00d7 m would just append two zeros to m. So, if m is a number with digits 1 and 0, then N would be m followed by two 0s. So, m can be any number with digits 1 and 0.\n\nBut N must also be divisible by 9. So, the sum of the digits of N must be a multiple of 9. Since N is m followed by two 0s, the sum of the digits of N is equal to the sum of the digits of m. Therefore, m must have a digit sum divisible by 9.\n\nMoreover, N must be divisible by 2, which it already is because it ends with 00.\n\nSo, now, the problem reduces to finding the smallest m such that:\n\n1. m consists of digits 1 and 0 only.\n2. The sum of the digits of m is a multiple of 9.\n3. When we append two 0s to m (to get N = m00), N is divisible by 450.\n\nWait, but since N is 100 \u00d7 m, and N must be divisible by 450, that means m must be divisible by 450 / 100 = 4.5. But m is an integer, so 4.5 doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, N = m \u00d7 100. Since N must be divisible by 450, then m \u00d7 100 must be divisible by 450. Therefore, m must be divisible by 450 / gcd(100,450).\n\nCompute gcd(100,450). 100 factors into 2\u00b2\u00d75\u00b2, and 450 is 2\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75\u00b2. So, gcd is 2\u00d75\u00b2=50. Therefore, m must be divisible by 450 / 50 = 9.\n\nSo, m must be divisible by 9, and m must consist of digits 1 and 0 only. So, m is a number made up of 1s and 0s, divisible by 9.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the smallest such m, which is a number made up of 1s and 0s, divisible by 9, and then N = m00 will be the required number.\n\nSo, to find the smallest m, which is made up of 1s and 0s, divisible by 9, and as small as possible. Once we find that, we can append two 0s to get N.\n\nSo, what's the smallest number made up of 1s and 0s divisible by 9? It's the smallest number with digit sum 9, because the smallest multiple of 9 is 9 itself, which is 111111111 (nine 1s). So, m would be 111111111, which is nine 1s.\n\nTherefore, N would be m00, which is 11111111100.\n\nBut wait, could there be a smaller m? For example, a number with fewer digits but still sum of digits 9.\n\nWait, the smallest number made up of 1s and 0s with digit sum 9 is 111111111, which is nine 1s. Any other arrangement with 1s and 0s would have at least nine digits, because to get a digit sum of 9, you need at least nine 1s. So, 111111111 is the smallest.\n\nTherefore, N = 11111111100, which is 11 digits.\n\nBut wait, let me check. Could there be a number with fewer digits that still has a digit sum of 9? For example, is there an 8-digit number with 9 ones? No, because 8 digits can't have 9 ones. Similarly, a 9-digit number must have exactly nine 1s if we are to get a digit sum of 9. So, 111111111 is indeed the smallest m.\n\nTherefore, the number N is 11111111100.\n\nBut wait, let's confirm that 11111111100 is indeed divisible by 450.\n\nFirst, check divisibility by 2: yes, ends with 0.\n\nDivisibility by 25: yes, ends with 00.\n\nDivisibility by 9: sum of digits is 9, which is divisible by 9.\n\nSo, yes, it's divisible by 450.\n\nIs there a smaller number? Let's think.\n\nSuppose I try a number with nine 1s and two 0s, but arranged differently. For example, 10101010100. But that's also 11 digits, and it's larger than 11111111100 because the first digit is 1, but the second digit is 0, making it smaller than 11111111100? Wait, no. Wait, 10101010100 is 10,101,010,100, while 11111111100 is 11,111,111,100. So, actually, 10101010100 is smaller. But wait, does it have a digit sum of 9?\n\nLet me check. 10101010100: the digits are 1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0. So, number of 1s is five. That's only five, which isn't a multiple of 9. So, it's not divisible by 9. So, that won't work.\n\nSo, any arrangement where the number of 1s isn't a multiple of 9 won't work. So, the smallest m is 111111111, which is nine 1s.\n\nTherefore, N is 11111111100.\n\nWait, but let me check another angle. Maybe a number with more than nine 1s but arranged in a way that the overall number is smaller.\n\nFor example, 100000000000 (12 digits) but that has only one 1, which isn't enough. Alternatively, 110000000000 (13 digits), which has two 1s, still not enough. So, to get a digit sum of 9, we need at least nine 1s, which gives us a number with at least nine digits.\n\nBut since N ends with two 0s, the minimal number of digits is nine (for m) + two (for the 00) = eleven digits.\n\nSo, the minimal N is 11 digits, and the minimal such N is 11111111100.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is 11111111100 the smallest number, or could there be a smaller number with nine 1s but arranged with 0s in between, making the number smaller?\n\nFor example, 10111111100. Let's compare 10111111100 and 11111111100.\n\nWhich one is smaller? Let's see:\n\n10111111100 is 10,111,111,100\n\n11111111100 is 11,111,111,100\n\nSo, 10,111,111,100 is smaller than 11,111,111,100. So, if 10111111100 is a multiple of 450, that would be a smaller number.\n\nBut does 10111111100 have a digit sum of 9?\n\nLet's count the digits: 1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0. So, number of 1s is 1 (first digit) + 7 (the next seven digits) = 8. Wait, that's only eight 1s. So, the digit sum is 8, which isn't a multiple of 9. So, it's not divisible by 9.\n\nSo, that won't work. So, we need exactly nine 1s.\n\nWait, let me try 100111111100. That's 13 digits. Wait, but 13 digits is longer than 11 digits, so 11111111100 is still smaller.\n\nAlternatively, 100000000000 has 12 digits, but only one 1, which isn't enough.\n\nWait, perhaps we can have a number like 1000000000000, but that's even longer.\n\nAlternatively, think of the number as starting with 1, then having some 0s and 1s, but the total number of 1s is nine, and it's as small as possible.\n\nWait, the smallest number with nine 1s is 111111111, which is nine digits. So, when we append two 0s, we get 11111111100, which is 11 digits. But maybe there's a way to arrange the 1s and 0s in the first nine digits to make the number smaller.\n\nWait, for example, 100000000000 (12 digits) but that only has one 1.\n\nWait, perhaps 1000000000000000000000001, but that's way too long.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal number is indeed 11111111100.\n\nBut let me think differently. Since m must be the smallest number made up of 1s and 0s, divisible by 9, which is 111111111. So, N is m followed by two 0s, so 11111111100.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: perhaps the number is 11111111100, but let's check if 450 \u00d7 k equals that.\n\nCompute 11111111100 \u00f7 450.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 11111111100 \u00f7 450.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 1111111110 \u00f7 45.\n\nNow, compute 1111111110 \u00f7 45.\n\nWell, 45 \u00d7 24,693,556 = ?\n\nWait, let me compute 45 \u00d7 246,935,560.\n\nWait, no, perhaps a better way is to perform the division.\n\nBut maybe 1111111110 \u00f7 45.\n\nCompute 45 \u00d7 24,693,556.\n\nWait, 45 \u00d7 24,693,556 = 45 \u00d7 (24,000,000 + 693,556) = 1,080,000,000 + 31,199,  something.\n\nWait, maybe I should do this differently.\n\nWait, 45 \u00d7 24,693,556.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to do the division step by step.\n\nCompute 1111111110 \u00f7 45.\n\n45 \u00d7 24 = 1,080\n\nWait, no, let's do long division.\n\n45 ) 1111111110\n\nHow many times does 45 go into 111? 2 times (45\u00d72=90). Subtract 90 from 111: 21.\n\nBring down the next 1: 211.\n\n45 goes into 211 4 times (45\u00d74=180). Subtract: 211-180=31.\n\nBring down the next 1: 311.\n\n45 goes into 311 6 times (45\u00d76=270).

Wait, but in our division, we have:\n\nThe steps gave us:\n\n- 2\n- 4\n- 6\n- 9\n- 1\n- 3\n- 5\n- 8\n\nSo, the quotient is 24,693,556.8? Wait, but that can't be right because 45 \u00d7 24,693,556 = ?\n\nWait, actually, let me compute 45 \u00d7 24,693,556.\n\nCompute 24,693,556 \u00d7 45:\n\nFirst, 24,693,556 \u00d7 40 = 987,742,240\n\nThen, 24,693,556 \u00d75= 123,467,780\n\nAdd them together: 987,742,240 + 123,467,780 = 1,111,209,  something.\n\nWait, 987,742,240 + 123,467,780:\n\n900,000,000 + 100,000,000 = 1,000,000,000\n\n80,000,000 + 20,000,000 = 100,000,000\n\n700,000 + 400,000 = 1,100,000\n\n2,000 + 7,000 = 9,000\n\n240 + 780 = 1,020\n\nWait, maybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the division earlier. Let me try again.\n\nCompute 45 ) 1111111110\n\nFirst, how many times does 45 go into 111? 2 times (45\u00d72=90).

Subtract: 36.\n\nBring down next 0: 360.\n\n45 into 360: 8 times (45\u00d78=360). Subtract: 0.\n\nSo, the quotient is 24693556 with a decimal? Wait, no, because the last digit was 0, so it's exact.\n\nWait, so 45 \u00d7 246,935,568 = 11,111,111,  something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me compute 246,935,568 \u00d7 45.\n\nCompute 246,935,568 \u00d7 45:\n\nFirst, 246,935,568 \u00d7 40 = 9,877,422,720\n\nThen, 246,935,568 \u00d75 = 1,234,677,840\n\nAdd them together:\n\n9,877,422,720 + 1,234,677,840 = 11,112,100,560\n\nWait, but 11111111100 is 11,111,111,100.\n\nWait, that's different. So, 45 \u00d7 246,935,568 = 11,112,100,560, which is larger than 11,111,111,100.\n\nHmm, that suggests that 11111111100 is not exactly divisible by 450? But earlier, we thought it was.\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, let's check 11111111100 \u00f7 450.\n\nCompute 11111111100 \u00f7 450.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 1,111,111,110 \u00f7 45.\n\nNow, compute 1,111,111,110 \u00f7 45.\n\nLet me compute 45 \u00d7 24,693,556.\n\nWait, 45 \u00d7 24,693,556 = ?\n\nCompute 24,693,556 \u00d7 45:\n\n24,693,556 \u00d7 40 = 987,742,240\n\n24,693,556 \u00d75 = 123,467,780\n\nAdding together: 987,742,240 + 123,467,780 = 1,111,210,020\n\nWait, but 1,111,210,020 \u2260 1,111,111,110. So, 45 \u00d7 24,693,556 = 1,111,210,020, which is greater than 1,111,111,110.\n\nTherefore, 45 \u00d7 24,693,556 = 1,111,210,020\n\nSo, 1,111,111,110 \u00f7 45 = 24,693,556. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the division.\n\nWait, 24,693,556 \u00d7 45 = 1,111,210,020, which is greater than 1,111,111,110. So, perhaps 24,693,556 \u00d7 45 is too big.\n\nWait, so maybe 24,693,555 \u00d7 45 = ?\n\n24,693,555 \u00d7 45 = ?\n\nSame as (24,693,556 -1) \u00d745 = 24,693,556\u00d745 -45 = 1,111,210,020 -45 = 1,111,210,  (wait, 1,111,210,020 -45 = 1,111,209,975)\n\nBut 1,111,209,975 is still greater than 1,111,111,110.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me instead compute 1,111,111,110 \u00f7 45.\n\nWell, 45 \u00d7 24,693,556 = 1,111,210,020, which is 98,910 more than 1,111,111,110.\n\nSo, 24,693,556 - (98,910 /45) = 24,693,556 - 2,198 = 24,691,358.\n\nWait, 24,691,358 \u00d745 = ?\n\nCompute 24,691,358 \u00d745:\n\n24,691,358 \u00d740 = 987,654,320\n\n24,691,358 \u00d75 = 123,456,790\n\nAdding together: 987,654,320 + 123,456,790 = 1,111,111,110.\n\nAh, there we go.\n\nSo, 45 \u00d7 24,691,358 = 1,111,111,110.\n\nTherefore, 1,111,111,110 \u00f745 =24,691,358.\n\nTherefore, 11111111100 \u00f7450 =24,691,358.\n\nSo, yes, 11111111100 is indeed a multiple of 450.\n\nBut wait, earlier, when I tried dividing 11111111100 by 450, I thought it wasn't, but now it's clear that it is.\n\nSo, that confirms that 11111111100 is a multiple of 450.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried 10111111100, which had only eight 1s, it wasn't a multiple of 9, so that's invalid. So, the minimal number is 11111111100.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there a smaller number with more than nine digits but fewer than 11 digits?\n\nWait, 10 digits: the number would have to have nine 1s and one 0, but must end with 00. So, in ten digits, the number would have nine 1s and one 0, but must end with 00. Wait, that's impossible because if it's ten digits, the last two digits are 00, so the remaining eight digits must have nine 1s, which is impossible because eight digits can only hold eight 1s. So, ten digits can't have nine 1s and end with 00. So, ten digits won't work.\n\nSimilarly, nine digits can't end with 00, so that's invalid. So, the next is eleven digits, which is the minimal.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number is 11111111100.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Could there be a number smaller than 11111111100 that is made up of 1s and 0s, ends with 00, and has a digit sum of 9?\n\nWait, for example, 100000000000 (12 digits) but that only has one 1.\n\nAlternatively, 1000000000000000000000001, but that's way too long.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the number is 11111111100, but let me think if there's a shorter number with nine 1s and two 0s at the end, but arranged differently to make the number smaller.\n\nFor example, 10101010100. Wait, but that's 10 digits, but it only has five 1s, which isn't enough.\n\nWait, what about

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive multiple of 450 that's made up only of zeros and ones. Hmm, let's start by understanding what exactly is being asked here.\n\nFirst, a multiple of 450 means that the number must be equal to 450 multiplied by some integer. So, we're looking for a number like 450 \u00d7 k, where k is a positive integer, and this number should consist only of digits 0 and 1. That means the number could be 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, etc., but it also has to be divisible by 450.\n\nAlright, so I should figure out what properties this number must have to be divisible by 450. Let me break down 450 into its prime factors to understand the divisibility rules better. 450 is equal to 45 \u00d7 10, and 45 is 9 \u00d7 5. So, 450 = 2 \u00d7 3\u00b2 \u00d7 5\u00b2. That means the number we're looking for must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. Let me note down the divisibility rules for these numbers.\n\nDivisibility by 2: The last digit must be even, which in our case can only be 0 because the number is made up of 0s and 1s.\n\nDivisibility by 25: The last two digits must form a number that's divisible by 25. Since our digits can only be 0 or 1, the possible endings are 00, 01, 10, or 11. Among these, only 00 is divisible by 25. So, the number must end with two zeros.\n\nDivisibility by 9: The sum of all digits must be a multiple of 9. Since the number can only have 0s and 1s, the number of 1s in the number must be a multiple of 9.\n\nSo, putting it together: The number must end with \"00,\" and the number of 1s must be a multiple of 9. Also, the number can't have any digits other than 0 and 1.\n\nSo, how can I construct such a number? Let's think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, the number ends with \"00.\" So, the last two digits are fixed as 00. The remaining part of the number (before the last two digits) can consist of 1s and 0s, but the total number of 1s must be a multiple of 9.\n\nLet me denote the number as N = [some digits][00], where [some digits] is a string of 0s and 1s. The total number of 1s in N should be a multiple of 9.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest such N. So, we need the smallest number (in terms of the number of digits) that satisfies these conditions.\n\nSo, the minimal number of digits would be 3: \"100.\" But let's check:\n\n- \"100\" has one 1, which is not a multiple of 9. So, not divisible by 9.\n\nNext, let's try numbers with two 1s: \"1100.\" Number of 1s is 2, not a multiple of 9. Still not good.\n\nNext, three 1s: \"11100.\" Number of 1s is 3, not a multiple of 9.\n\nContinuing this way, 4: \"111100\" (4 ones), nope. 5: \"1111100\" (5), still no. 6: \"11111100\" (6), not multiple of 9. 7: \"111111100\" (7), nope. 8: \"1111111100\" (8), still not. 9: \"11111111100\" (9 ones). Okay, 9 is a multiple of 9, so that's a candidate.\n\nWait, but is 11111111100 a multiple of 450?\n\nLet me check. First, confirm it's divisible by 2: The last digit is 0, so yes.\n\nDivisible by 25: Last two digits are 00, so yes.\n\nDivisible by 9: Sum of digits is 9, which is a multiple of 9, so yes.\n\nSo, 11111111100 is a multiple of 450.\n\nBut is this the smallest such number? Let me see if there's a smaller number with fewer digits.\n\nWait, maybe arranging the 1s in different positions could result in a smaller number. For example, numbers with 1s in higher places.\n\nWait, but the number must end with \"00.\" So, the other digits can be arranged with 1s and 0s, but the earliest possible arrangement would have the minimal number of digits.\n\nWait, but 11111111100 is 11 digits long. Maybe a smaller number with fewer digits can be constructed with the same number of 1s but placed earlier. Hmm, perhaps not, because the number must end with 00, so the 1s have to be before the last two digits.\n\nWait, but perhaps the number can be shorter if the leading digits are 1s and the rest are 0s, except the last two. So, the minimal number is 100, but that's too short. Let me think.\n\nWait, the number of 1s has to be 9, so the number must have at least 9 ones. Therefore, the minimal number of digits would be 9 (all 1s) plus 2 zeros at the end, so 11 digits. So, 11 digits is the minimum possible.\n\nBut is 11111111100 the smallest number? Or can we arrange the 1s and 0s in a way that creates a smaller number but still has 9 ones before the last two zeros? Because 11111111100 is 11 digits, but perhaps a different arrangement with fewer digits?\n\nWait, no. Because to have 9 ones, you need at least 9 digits, plus the two zeros, so 11 digits. So, 11 digits is indeed the minimal length.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smaller number with more zeros in the middle. Wait, but the number must consist of only 0s and 1s, so if we place zeros in the middle, the number would be smaller. For example, 100000000000 (but that's 12 digits, which is longer than 11 digits), but that only has one 1, which isn't enough. Hmm.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the number must have exactly 9 ones. So, arranging the 9 ones with 0s in between might result in a smaller number than 11111111100.\n\nWait, for example, 10000000000 (but that's 10 digits with one 1, which isn't enough). Or 10101010100 (which is 10 digits, but let's check how many 1s: 1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0. So that's five 1s. Not enough. Similarly, 11001100100: let's count the 1s. 1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0: that's six 1s. Still not enough.\n\nWait, maybe 1010101010100: but that would be 12 digits, which is longer. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't fruitful.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to model this as a number consisting of 9 ones and some zeros, but arranged in a way that the number is as small as possible. The smallest number with 9 ones would have the ones as far to the right as possible. But since the last two digits must be zeros, maybe shifting the ones to the right as much as possible would make the number smaller.\n\nWait, but the ones have to be before the last two zeros. So, the smallest number would be the one where the 9 ones are as far to the right as possible, but still before the two zeros.\n\nWait, for example, 11111111100 is 11 digits, with all the ones first, then the two zeros. But maybe if we place some zeros among the ones, we can get a smaller number. Because numbers are smaller when they have zeros in the higher digits.\n\nWait, for example, 100000000000 (12 digits) is 1 followed by eleven zeros, but that's only one 1, which is insufficient. If we have 100111111100, which is 12 digits. Let's count the 1s: 1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0. That's eight 1s. Still not enough.\n\nWait, maybe 100011111100: that's 12 digits, 1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0. That's seven 1s. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, 1000001111100: 12 digits, 1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0. Wait, that's six 1s. Still not enough.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to try to model this as a problem where we need to find the minimal number with 9 ones, ending with two zeros. So, the minimal number would have the 9 ones as far to the right as possible, with as many zeros as possible in the higher digits.\n\nWait, but the minimal number is the smallest number, so leading digits should be as small as possible. So, the first digit should be 1, followed by as many zeros as possible, then the remaining ones and two zeros.\n\nWait, for example, 1 followed by eight zeros, then nine ones, but that would be 1 followed by eight zeros, nine ones, and two zeros? Wait, that would be 1000000001111111100, which is 20 digits long, which is way longer than 11 digits. So, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe 11111111100 is indeed the smallest such number because it's the minimal number of digits (11) with 9 ones followed by two zeros. But let me check if there's a number with fewer digits.\n\nWait, no, because 9 ones require at least 9 digits, plus the two zeros at the end, so 11 digits is the minimal. So, 11111111100 is 11 digits, and any other arrangement with 9 ones and two zeros at the end would be either longer or not smaller.\n\nWait, let me test another arrangement. For instance, 100000000100: that's 12 digits, with two 1s, which isn't enough. Or 100000001100: that's three 1s. Not enough. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps if we arrange the 9 ones with some zeros in between, the number could be smaller than 11111111100. Let's see: the number must end with two zeros, so the 9 ones are in the preceding digits.\n\nSo, the smallest number would be the one where the 9 ones are placed as far to the right as possible, but before the two zeros. So, arranging the 9 ones as 111111111 followed by 00, which is 11111111100.\n\nAlternatively, if we can place some zeros between the ones, perhaps making the number smaller, but I don't think so because the leading ones make the number larger.\n\nWait, for example, 100000000000 is 1 followed by twelve zeros, which is 13 digits, but only one 1. Not enough.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Since the number must be divisible by 450, it's also divisible by 50, because 450 is 9\u00d750. So, the number must end with 00, 50, or 00 again. Wait, no, because the number can only have 0s and 1s, so it must end with 00. So, that's confirmed.\n\nWait, so the number must end with 00, and before that, we can have any combination of 1s and 0s, provided the total number of 1s is a multiple of 9.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the smallest number composed of 1s and 0s, ending with 00, with the number of 1s being a multiple of 9.\n\nSo, the minimal such number would be the minimal number with 9 ones and two zeros at the end, arranged in such a way that the number is as small as possible.\n\nTo make a number as small as possible, we want the higher place values (leftmost digits) to be as small as possible. So, leading 1s are necessary because the number can't start with 0. So, the first digit is 1, then we can have as many zeros as possible, then the remaining 8 ones, and ending with two zeros.\n\nWait, but that might not necessarily produce the smallest number. Let me think.\n\nWait, for example, 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 (but that's too long and only has one 1). Wait, no, we need 9 ones.\n\nWait, perhaps the smallest number is 100000000100, but that's only two 1s. Not enough.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as a BFS problem, where each state represents the current number of 1s and the current digit position, and we try to find the smallest number that meets the criteria.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number being a multiple of 450, so it's also a multiple of 9, 25, and 2.\n\nWait, since the number ends with 00, it's divisible by 100, which is 4\u00d725. So, it's already divisible by 4 and 25. Since it's also divisible by 9, and 4\u00d79=36, so the number must be divisible by LCM(4,9,25) = 900. Wait, 450 is 9\u00d750, which is 9\u00d72\u00d725. So, LCM(4,9,25)= 4\u00d79\u00d725= 900. So, if the number is divisible by 900, it's divisible by 450. But 900 is 450\u00d72. So, maybe 450\u00d7k must be equal to some number consisting of 0s and 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the problem as finding the smallest number consisting of 0s and 1s that's divisible by 450, which is equivalent to finding the smallest such number divisible by 900, since 900 is a multiple of 450.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because 450 divides 900, so any multiple of 900 is a multiple of 450, but not vice versa. So, if I find a number that's a multiple of 900, it's a multiple of 450, but maybe a smaller multiple of 450 is not a multiple of 900. So, perhaps I need to consider both possibilities.\n\nWait, but let's think again. The number must end with 00, so it's divisible by 100, which is 4\u00d725. So, it's divisible by 4 and 25. Additionally, it's divisible by 9, so the total number of 1s is a multiple of 9. Therefore, the number must be divisible by LCM(4,9,25) = 900. So, the number must be a multiple of 900. Therefore, the minimal such number would be the smallest multiple of 900 that consists only of 0s and 1s.\n\nWait, but 900 is 450\u00d72, so the minimal multiple of 900 made of 0s and 1s would be the same as the minimal multiple of 450 made of 0s and 1s, because 900 is a multiple of 450. So, perhaps I can model this as finding the minimal multiple of 900 that's made up of 0s and 1s.\n\nWait, but let's check. Let me try to find the minimal number made of 0s and 1s that's divisible by 900. So, the number must end with 00 (divisible by 100), and the sum of digits must be a multiple of 9 (divisible by 9). So, the number must end with 00, and have a sum of digits equal to 9, 18, 27, etc.\n\nSo, the minimal such number would be the smallest number with sum of digits 9, ending with 00. So, the minimal number would be the smallest number with 9 ones and ending with 00, arranged in such a way that the number is as small as possible.\n\nSo, to make the number as small as possible, we want the leftmost digits to be as small as possible. So, starting with 1, then as many zeros as possible, then the remaining 8 ones, then ending with 00.\n\nWait, let's try that. So, 1 followed by n zeros, then 8 ones, then 00. But how many zeros should be between the first 1 and the 8 ones?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number would be 1000000001111111100. Wait, let's count the digits. 1, followed by 8 zeros, then 8 ones, then 00. That's 1 + 8 + 8 + 2 = 19 digits. That seems long. But maybe there's a shorter arrangement.\n\nWait, perhaps placing the 8 ones after the first 1, with as few zeros as possible. For example, 11111111100 is 11 digits, which is shorter. So, maybe this is the minimal number.\n\nWait, but does 11111111100 equal 900 \u00d7 k for some k? Let me check: 11111111100 \u00f7 900. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 11111111100 \u00f7 100 = 111111111. Then, 111111111 \u00f7 9 = 12345679. So, 11111111100 = 900 \u00d7 12345679. So yes, it's a multiple of 900, and hence a multiple of 450.\n\nSo, 11111111100 is indeed a multiple of 450, and it's made up of 9 ones followed by two zeros, totaling 11 digits. Is there a smaller number than this that meets the criteria?\n\nWait, let's think: The number must end with 00, so the last two digits are fixed. The part before that must have a sum of digits equal to 9. So, the minimal number would have the 9 ones as far to the right as possible.\n\nWait, so perhaps 100000000000 (but that's only one 1, which isn't enough). 1000000000000 is 13 digits with one 1. Not enough.\n\nWait, maybe 100000000100: that's 12 digits, with two 1s. Not enough. 100000001100: three 1s. Still not enough.\n\nWait, perhaps 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 (but that's way too long and only has one 1). Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: Since the number must be divisible by 9, and the sum of its digits is 9, 18, etc., and it must end with 00, the minimal number of digits is 11 (9 ones + 2 zeros). So, 11111111100 is 11 digits, which might be the minimal possible.\n\nWait, but let me check if a number with 18 ones exists that's shorter than 11111111100. Wait, 18 ones would require at least 18 + 2 = 20 digits, which is longer than 11 digits, so that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that 11111111100 is the minimal number that meets all the criteria: it's a multiple of 450, it's made up of only 0s and 1s, and it's the smallest such number.\n\nWait, but let me check another possibility. Suppose the number has 9 ones, but not necessarily all at the beginning. Maybe placing some zeros between them could result in a smaller number.\n\nFor example, 10101010100: let's count the 1s. 1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0. That's five 1s. Not enough. So, the sum is 5, which isn't a multiple of 9.\n\nWait, what if we have 100111111100: 1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0. That's eight 1s, which is still not a multiple of 9. So, that's not good.\n\nWait, maybe 1000000001111111100: that's 1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0. That's 19 digits, with 9 ones. Hmm, but 19 digits is longer than 11 digits, so 11111111100 is still shorter.\n\nWait, maybe another arrangement: 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 (but that's 33 digits, only one 1. Not enough).\n\nWait, perhaps 10000000011111111100: that's 1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0. 20 digits, 9 ones. Still longer than 11 digits.\n\nSo, it seems that 11111111100 is the smallest such number, being 11 digits long, with 9 ones followed by two zeros, meeting all the divisibility conditions.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a number with 9 ones and two zeros at the end but arranged in a way that the number is smaller than 11111111100.
